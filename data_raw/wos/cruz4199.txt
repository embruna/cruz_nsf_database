AB Several high-temperature body-centered cubic (bcc) structural materials such as Nb-, Zr- and Ti-based alloys undergo phase separation, which is a second-order phase transformation, whereby the host lattice decomposes into distinct bcc domains with different compositions. Using atomistic simulations, we studied the high-strain-rate response of bcc-forming Nb-xZr (x = 0, 25, 50 at.%) alloys. To induce phase separation in our starter alloy, we first employed hybrid Monte Carlo/Molecular Dynamics simulations in single crystals of Nb-xZr at 1000 K. Subsequently, these crystals were deformed along different crystallographic orientations (< 001 >, < 110 > and < 111 >) at a strain rate of 10(+) 8 s(-1), to investigate orientation dependent mechanical response. The phase-separated Nb-xZr microstructures exhibited distinct bcc domains enriched in either Zr or Nb. Notably, Nb-50 at.%Zr contained coarser Zr-domains compared to Nb-25 at.%Zr. The Zr-rich domains acted as "soft" inclusions, resulting in reduced peak strengths in the following order: pure Nb (Nb-0 at.%Zr) > Nb-25 at.%Zr > Nb-50 at.%Zr. This implies that phase separation causes softening in Nb-xZr. We also discovered two deformation pathways that depended on the crystallographic orientation: (i) For deformation along < 110 > and < 111 > directions: Elastic deformation was followed by dislocation plasticity on {110} < 111 > slip systems; and (ii) For deformation along < 001 > direction: Elastic deformation was followed by the formation of a volumetric fcc structure, twinning on {112}< 111 > system, and the formation fcc-phase at the twin/matrix interfacial regions. This was ultimately accompanied by dislocation plasticity on {110}< 111 > slip system. The bcc ->.fcc displacive transformation facilitated {112}< 111 > twinning when Nb-xZr was deformed along < 001 >. Our investigation shows that softening of bcc alloys can result from a coupling of mechanisms involving local solute segregation, displacive phase transformation and twinning occurring across multiple slip planes.

AB Mechanistic studies of the morphology of lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (LHP-NCs) are hampered by a lack of generalizable suitable synthetic strategies and ligand systems. Here, the synthesis of zwitterionic CsPbBr3 NCs is presented with controlled anisotropy using a proposed "surface-selective ligand pairs" strategy. Such a strategy provides a platform to systematically study the binding affinity of capping ligand pairs and the resulting LHP morphologies. By using zwitterionic ligands (ZwL) with varying structures, majority ZwL-capped LHP NCs with controlled morphology are obtained, including anisotropic nanoplatelets and nanorods, for the first time. Combining experiments with density functional theory calculations, factors that govern the ligand binding on the different surface facets of LHP-NCs are revealed, including the steric bulkiness of the ligand, the number of binding sites, and the charge distance between binding moieties. This study provides guidance for the further exploration of anisotropic LHP-NCs.

AB Massive amounts of high-quality data are the prerequisite and support for AI technologies. Due to the nature of privacy-preserving and low communication overheads, federated learning (FL) has garnered considerable attention in comparison with traditional data collection methods. However, the performance of FL is hampered by the lack of interested clients and limited local data due to selfishness and individual behavioral preferences. To this end, we propose PractFL, a proactive and distributed framework that incorporates the concept of mobile crowdsensing into the FL paradigm. Specifically, we design an incentive mechanism in the form of virtual red packets, which are a widely used way of monetary reward and gift-giving in social lives. In this article we extend this further by giving meaning to the locations, i.e., the red packets are only accessible at specific places. The virtual red packets' locations and monetary amounts can be dynamically updated by the cloud center to encourage clients to collect additional data that may benefit the FL process. Further, we propose a distributed behavioral decision engine based on multiarmed bandits (i.e., choose which red packet to go for) in response to the incentive mechanism enforced by the cloud. Considering the movement cost and conflicts with otherclients, K-anonymity and probabilistic selection are introduced in the distributed behavioral decision to recommend the optimal red packet choice for clients without revealing their privacy. The experimental results demonstrate that PractFL outperforms the baselines in terms of classification accuracy. We also find that PractFL can effectively alleviate the overfitting problem caused by class imbalance during the training.

DT Article
ID DIODES
AB AlScN is a new wide bandgap, high-k, ferroelectric material for radio frequency (RF), memory, and power applications. Successful integration of high-quality AlScN with GaN in epitaxial layer stacks depends strongly on the ability to control lattice parameters and surface or interface through growth. This study investigates the molecular beam epitaxy growth and transport properties of AlScN/GaN multilayer heterostructures. Single-layer Al1-xScxN/GaN heterostructures exhibited lattice-matched composition within x = 0.09-0.11 using substrate (thermocouple) growth temperatures between 330 and 630 degrees C. By targeting the lattice-matched Sc composition, pseudomorphic AlScN/GaN multilayer structures with ten and twenty periods were achieved, exhibiting excellent structural and interface properties as confirmed by x-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). These multilayer heterostructures exhibited substantial polarization-induced net mobile charge densities of up to 8.24 x 10(14)/cm(2) for twenty channels. The sheet density scales with the number of AlScN/GaN periods. By identifying lattice-matched growth condition and using it to generate multiple conductive channels, this work enhances our understanding of the AlScN/GaN material platform.

AB Aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions are a leading source of uncertainty in estimating climate sensitivity. Remote marine boundary layers where accumulation mode (similar to 100-400 nm diameter) aerosol concentrations are relatively low are very susceptible to aerosol changes. These regions also experience heightened Aitken mode aerosol (similar to 10-100 nm) concentrations associated with ocean biology. Aitken aerosols may significantly influence cloud properties and evolution by replenishing cloud condensation nuclei and droplet number lost through precipitation (i.e., Aitken buffering). We use a large-eddy simulation with an Aitken-mode enabled microphysics scheme to examine the role of Aitken buffering in a mid-latitude decoupled boundary layer cloud regime observed on 15 July 2017 during the Aerosol and Cloud Experiments in the Eastern North Atlantic flight campaign: cumulus rising into stratocumulus under elevated Aitken concentrations (similar to 100-200 mg-1). In situ measurements are used to constrain and evaluate this case study. Our simulation accurately captures observed aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions and reveals time-evolving processes driving regime development and evolution. Aitken activation into the accumulation mode in the cumulus layer provides a reservoir for turbulence and convection to carry accumulation aerosols into the drizzling stratocumulus layer above. Further Aitken activation occurs aloft in the stratocumulus layer. Together, these activation events buffer this cloud regime against precipitation removal, reducing cloud break-up and associated increases in heterogeneity. We examine cloud evolution sensitivity to initial aerosol conditions. With halved accumulation number, Aitken aerosols restore accumulation concentrations, maintain droplet number similar to original values, and prevent cloud break-up. Without Aitken aerosols, precipitation-driven cloud break-up occurs rapidly. In this regime, Aitken buffering sustains brighter, more homogeneous clouds for longer.
   Aerosols, small particles in the atmosphere associated with ocean biology, sea spray, land, and human-produced emissions, influence cloud brightness and, by suppressing precipitation and subsequent break up, cloud lifetime. Understanding aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions is critical in understanding how aerosols influence the climate system. This study examines how the very smallest aerosol particles modify cloud formation, brightness, and lifetime over the North Atlantic ocean. We utilize a recent set of aircraft and satellite observations from a dedicated field campaign as well as a detailed model that resolves fine-scale interactions important to cloud development. After comparing the model to real-world observations, we test how modifying the amount of small particles impacts the cloud brightness and lifetime.

TI A simple method to alter the binding specificity of DNA-coated colloids
   that crystallize
SO SOFT MATTER
LA English

ID TRANSITIONS
AB DNA-coated colloids can crystallize into a multitude of lattices, ranging from face-centered cubic to diamond, opening avenues to producing structures with useful photonic properties. The potential design space of DNA-coated colloids is large, but its exploration is hampered by a reliance on chemically modified DNA that is slow and expensive to commercially synthesize. Here we introduce a method to controllably tailor the sequences of DNA-coated particles by covalently appending new sequence domains onto the DNA grafted to colloidal particles. The tailored particles crystallize as readily and at the same temperature as those produced via direct chemical synthesis, making them suitable for self-assembly. Moreover, we show that particles coated with a single sequence can be converted into a variety of building blocks with differing specificities by appending different DNA sequences to them. This method will make it practical to identify optimal and complex particle sequence designs and paves the way to programming the assembly kinetics of DNA-coated colloids.
   The binding properties of DNA-coated colloids are modified by growing new DNA domains on the particles' surface using an isothermal DNA polymerization reaction.

AB An emergency discharge of nutrient-rich effluent from the defunct Piney Point fertilizer stack into Tampa Bay at Port Manatee occurred from 30 March-8 April 2021. This resulted in a pollutant plume that evolved over time and space across the entire bay, including its environmentally sensitive marine preserves, and out onto the adjacent continental shelf. As a rapid response to environmental concerns, the plume evolution was simulated using the high resolution, unstructured grid, Tampa Bay Coastal Ocean Model (TBCOM) nowcast/forecast system, with an embedded tracer module that included realistic point discharge rates. Normalized tracer distributions were automatically updated each day, providing 1-day hindcasts and 3.5-day forecasts. Due to mixing and advection, tracer concentration was quickly reduced by two or more orders of magnitude as the plume spread out. Highest tracer concentrations hugged the southeastern Tampa Bay shoreline during the first week. Lower tracer concentrations were gradually advected to the western side of Tampa Bay, and the tracer was slowly flushed out of the bay to be transported primarily northward along the coast. The modeled plume evolution served as principal guidance for coordinating environmental monitoring by state, local and academic personnel. The model results also provide a basis for future multidisciplinary studies.

AB Wadsley-Roth phases have emerged as highly promising anode materials for Li-ion batteries and are an important class of phases that can form as part of the oxide scales of refractory multiprinciple element alloys. An algorithmic approach is described to systematically enumerate two classes of Wadsley-Roth crystallographic shear structures. An analysis of algorithmically generated Wadsley-Roth phases reveals that a diverse set of oxide crystal structures belongs to the Wadsley-Roth family of phases. First-principles calculations enable the identification of crystallographic and chemical factors that affect Wadsley-Roth phase stability, pointing in particular to the importance of the number and nature of the edges shared by neighboring metal-oxygen octahedra. A systematic study of Wadsley-Roth phases in the Ti-Nb-O ternary system shows that the cations with the highest oxidation states segregate to octahedral sites that minimize the number of shared edges, while cations with the lowest oxidation state accumulate to edge-sharing octahedra at shear boundaries.

TI Unpolarized proton PDF at NNLO from lattice QCD with physical quark

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
LA English
DT Article
ID PARTON DISTRIBUTIONS
AB We present a lattice QCD calculation of the unpolarized isovector quark parton distribution function (PDF) of the proton utilizing a perturbative matching at next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO). The calculations are carried out using a single ensemble of gauge configurations generated with Nf = 2 thorn 1 highly-improved staggered quarks with physical masses and a lattice spacing of a = 0.076 fm. We use one iteration of hypercubic smearing on these gauge configurations, and the resulting smeared configurations are then used for all aspects of the subsequent calculation. For the valence quarks, we use the Wilson-clover action with physical quark masses. We consider several methods for extracting information on the PDF. We first extract the lowest four Mellin moments using the leading-twist operator product expansion approximation. Then, we determine the x dependence of the PDF through a deep neural network within the pseudo-PDF approach and additionally through the framework of large-momentum effective theory utilizing a hybrid renormalization scheme. This is the first application of the NNLO matching coefficients for the nucleon directly at the physical point.

TI Genome Mining from Agriculturally Relevant Fungi Led to a D-Glucose
   Esterified Polyketide with a Terpene-like Core Structure
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
AB Comparison of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) found in devastating plant pathogens and biocontrol fungi revealed an uncharacterized and conserved polyketide BGC. Genome mining identified the associated metabolite to be treconorin, which has a terpene-like, trans-fused 5,7-bicyclic core that is proposed to derive from a (4 + 3) cycloaddition. The core is esterified with d-glucose, which derives from the glycosidic cleavage of a trehalose ester precursor. This glycomodification strategy is different from the commonly observed glycosylation of natural products.

AB Numerous body-centered cubic refractory multiprincipal element alloys (RMPEAs) exhibit high temperature strengths that surpass those of Ni-based superalloys. The superior properties of RMPEAs have been shown to stem in part from the unique dislocation glide mechanisms in compositionally disordered systems. Here, using a three-dimensional phase field dislocation dynamics approach combined with Langevin dynamics, we simulate the glide mechanisms of screw and edge dislocations at elevated temperature and low stress levels in the RMPEA MoNbTi with a body-centered cubic, random solid solution structure. For 600-1200 K, edge-dislocation glide is smooth, temperature sensitive, and faster than screw dislocation glide. Screw dislocations exhibit three distinct glide mechanisms over the same temperature range. Ultimately, the formation of nonplanar kink pairs that ensues above 900 K reduces screw mobility with respect to temperature and leads to athermal mobility from 1100 to 1200 K.

AB Rapid and accurate quantification of low-abundance protein biomarkers in biofluids can transform the diagnosis of a range of pathologies, including infectious diseases. Here, we harness ultrabright plasmonic fluors as "digital nanolabels" and demonstrate the detection and quantification of subfemtomolar concentrations of human IL-6 and SARS-CoV-2 alpha and variant proteins in clinical nasopharyngeal swab and saliva samples from COVID-19 patients. The resulting digital plasmonic fluor-linked immunosorbent assay (digital p-FLISA) enables detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein, both in solution and in live virions. Digital p-FLISA outperforms the "gold standard" enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), having a nearly 7000-fold lower limit-of-detection, and outperforms a commercial antigen test, having over 5000-fold improvement in analytical sensitivity. Detection and quantification of very low concentrations of target proteins holds potential for early detection of pathological conditions, treatment monitoring, and personalized medicine.

AB This study focuses on addressing the inverse source problem associated with the parabolic equation. We rely on sparse boundary flux data as our measurements, which are acquired from a restricted section of the boundary. While it has been established that utilizing sparse boundary flux data can enable source recovery, the presence of a limited number of observation sensors poses a challenge for accurately tracing the inverse quantity of interest. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a sampling algorithm grounded in Langevin dynamics that incorporates dynamic sensors to capture the flux information. Furthermore, we propose and discuss two distinct dynamic sensor migration strategies. Remarkably, our findings demonstrate that even with only two observation sensors at our disposal, it remains feasible to successfully reconstruct the high-dimensional unknown parameters.

AB With the rapidly increasing number of bandwidth-intensive terminals capable of intelligent computing and communication, such as smart devices equipped with shallow neural network (NN) models, the complexity of multiple access (MA) for these intelligent terminals is increasing due to the dynamic network environment and ubiquitous connectivity in sixth-generation (6G) systems. Traditional MA design and optimization methods are gradually losing ground to artificial intelligence (AI) techniques that have proven their superiority in handling complexity. AI-empowered MA and its optimization strategies aimed at achieving high quality-of-service (QoS) are attracting more attention, especially in the area of latency-sensitive applications in 6G systems. In this work, we aim to: 1) present the development and comparative evaluation of AI-enabled MA; 2) provide a timely survey focusing on spectrum sensing, protocol design, and optimization for AI-empowered MA; and 3) explore the potential use cases of AI-empowered MA in the typical application scenarios within 6G systems. Specifically, we first present a unified framework of AI-empowered MA for 6G systems by incorporating various promising machine learning (ML) techniques in spectrum sensing, resource allocation, MA protocol design, and optimization. We then introduce AI-empowered MA spectrum sensing related to spectrum sharing and spectrum interference management. Next, we discuss the AI-empowered MA protocol designs and implementation methods by reviewing and comparing the state of the art and further explore the optimization algorithms related to dynamic resource management, parameter adjustment, and access scheme switching. Finally, we discuss the current challenges, point out open issues, and outline potential future research directions in this field.

AB Proteins can target subsets of lipid droplets (LDs), but how this is mechanistically achieved is unclear. Here, Speer et al. characterize the protein triglyceride (TG)-associated lipid droplet protein 1 (Tld1) and dissect why it targets TG-rich LDs, as well as how it influences yeast lipolysis.
   Cells store lipids in the form of triglyceride (TG) and sterol ester (SE) in lipid droplets (LDs). Distinct pools of LDs exist, but a pervasive question is how proteins localize to and convey functions to LD subsets. Here, we show that the yeast protein YDR275W/Tld1 (for TG-associated LD protein 1) localizes to a subset of TG-containing LDs and reveal it negatively regulates lipolysis. Mechanistically, Tld1 LD targeting requires TG, and it is mediated by two distinct hydrophobic regions (HRs). Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that Tld1's HRs interact with TG on LDs and adopt specific conformations on TG-rich LDs versus SE-rich LDs in yeast and human cells. Tld1-deficient yeast display no defect in LD biogenesis but exhibit elevated TG lipolysis dependent on lipase Tgl3. Remarkably, overexpression of Tld1, but not LD protein Pln1/Pet10, promotes TG accumulation without altering SE pools. Finally, we find that Tld1-deficient cells display altered LD mobilization during extended yeast starvation. We propose that Tld1 senses TG-rich LDs and regulates lipolysis on LD subpopulations.

TI Machine learning-guided co-optimization of fitness and diversity
   facilitates combinatorial library design in enzyme engineering
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS

DT Article
ID DIRECTED EVOLUTION; CYTOCHROME-C; CARBENE; PREDICTION
AB The effective design of combinatorial libraries to balance fitness and diversity facilitates the engineering of useful enzyme functions, particularly those that are poorly characterized or unknown in biology. We introduce MODIFY, a machine learning (ML) algorithm that learns from natural protein sequences to infer evolutionarily plausible mutations and predict enzyme fitness. MODIFY co-optimizes predicted fitness and sequence diversity of starting libraries, prioritizing high-fitness variants while ensuring broad sequence coverage. In silico evaluation shows that MODIFY outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods in zero-shot fitness prediction and enables ML-guided directed evolution with enhanced efficiency. Using MODIFY, we engineer generalist biocatalysts derived from a thermostable cytochrome c to achieve enantioselective C-B and C-Si bond formation via a new-to-nature carbene transfer mechanism, leading to biocatalysts six mutations away from previously developed enzymes while exhibiting superior or comparable activities. These results demonstrate MODIFY's potential in solving challenging enzyme engineering problems beyond the reach of classic directed evolution.
   The effective design of cold-start enzyme libraries to balance fitness and diversity enables access to enzyme variants that are readily evolvable and close to the optima in the fitness landscape. Here, the authors develop MODIFY (machine learning-optimized library design with improved fitness and diversity), a machine learning algorithm to co-optimize expected fitness and sequence diversity of starting libraries, enhancing the efficiency of directed evolution in enzyme engineering.

AB Motivated by the advancing computational capacity of distributed end-user equipment (UE), as well as the increasing concerns about sharing private data, there has been considerable recent interest in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) that can be processed on distributed UEs. Specifically, in this paradigm, parts of an ML process are outsourced to multiple distributed UEs. Then, the processed information is aggregated on a certain level at a central server, which turns a centralized ML process into a distributed one and brings about significant benefits. However, this new distributed ML paradigm raises new risks in terms of privacy and security issues. In this article, we provide a survey of the emerging security and privacy risks of distributed ML from a unique perspective of information exchange levels, which are defined according to the key steps of an ML process, i.e., we consider the following levels: 1) the level of preprocessed data; 2) the level of learning models; 3) the level of extracted knowledge; and 4) the level of intermediate results. We explore and analyze the potential of threats for each information exchange level based on an overview of current state-of-the-art attack mechanisms and then discuss the possible defense methods against such threats. Finally, we complete the survey by providing an outlook on the challenges and possible directions for future research in this critical area.

TI Crystal structure and electrical and optical properties of
   two-dimensional group-IV monochalcogenides
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
LA English
DT Article
ID NANOSHEETS; FIELD; MOS2
AB Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor materials offer a platform for unconventional applications such as valleytronics, flexible nanoelectronics, and hosts of quantum emitters. Many of these materials and their electronic properties remain to be explored. Using ab initio simulations based on the density functional theory, we investigate group-IV monochalcogenides MQ (M = Si, Ge, Sn and Q = S, Se, Te), an emerging class of 2D materials, with two competing crystal structures: (i) phosphorenelike (Pmn21), which has already been synthesized, and (ii) SiTe-type (P3 over bar m1), which has been much less explored. Except for SnS, we find that the SiTe type is the lowest-energy structure and has higher structural stability, motivating efforts to synthesize this less explored P3 over bar m1 phase. Regarding the optoelectronic properties of these two phases, in the P3 over bar m1 phase, MQ compounds have band gaps around the sunlight spectrum peak and show narrower variations in band gap with the composition and higher absorption coefficients for lighter chalcogens. In contrast, in the Pmn21 phase, MQ compounds have wider band gaps and show a band gap variation of up to 72% with composition, higher absorption coefficients with Te atoms, and potential for valleytronics. In particular, SiS shows interesting high optical anisotropy among all the investigated materials. Furthermore, the optical spectra present peaks that are particular to each phase or composition, making the refractive index a distinguishing parameter for identifying the different MQ compounds. Finally, a phase transition from monolayer to bulk due to an interaction between the layers is observed. Thus, the present results straighten out the role of the crystalline phase in the optoelectronic properties of these monochalcogenides.

AB Heterogeneous interfaces influence chemical reactions by stabilizing the adsorption of reactive intermediates, lowering activation barriers of rate- and selectivity-determining steps. Here, we elucidate periodic trends in metal surface oxidation resulting from interaction with nitric oxide and subsequent adsorbate reaction chemistry across the late 3d transition-metal series with surface-sensitive ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AP-XPS) and density functional theory calculations. Metals with open d-shell orbitals (e.g., Fe, Co) favor stabilization of nitric oxide dissociation products (nitrogen adatoms, N*), while metals having near (e.g., Ni) or completely (e.g., Cu) closed d shells promote nitric oxide oxidation toward nitrite and lower total nitrogen and N* coverage. Adsorbate core-level (O 1s and N 1s) binding energies capture electron localization around nitrogen, and eventually oxygen, as nitric oxide moves toward dissociation. Metal-nitride covalency increases with decreasing transition metal electronegativity, where nitrogen adatom binding energies decrease as the transition metal d-band is pushed toward the Fermi level. This work illustrates experimental and theoretical relationships between the nature of the d-band in facilitating nitric oxide adsorption and dissociation chemistry, furthering fundamental understanding of the role of metal electronic structure in determining catalytically relevant adsorption properties.

AB Plasma etching is an essential semiconductor manufacturing technology required to enable the current microelectronics industry. Along with lithographic patterning, thin-film formation methods, and others, plasma etching has dynamically evolved to meet the exponentially growing demands of the microelectronics industry that enables modern society. At this time, plasma etching faces a period of unprecedented changes owing to numerous factors, including aggressive transition to three-dimensional (3D) device architectures, process precision approaching atomic-scale critical dimensions, introduction of new materials, fundamental silicon device limits, and parallel evolution of post-CMOS approaches. The vast growth of the microelectronics industry has emphasized its role in addressing major societal challenges, including questions on the sustainability of the associated energy use, semiconductor manufacturing related emissions of greenhouse gases, and others. The goal of this article is to help both define the challenges for plasma etching and point out effective plasma etching technology options that may play essential roles in defining microelectronics manufacturing in the future. The challenges are accompanied by significant new opportunities, including integrating experiments with various computational approaches such as machine learning/artificial intelligence and progress in computational approaches, including the realization of digital twins of physical etch chambers through hybrid/coupled models. These prospects can enable innovative solutions to problems that were not available during the past 50 years of plasma etch development in the microelectronics industry. To elaborate on these perspectives, the present article brings together the views of various experts on the different topics that will shape plasma etching for microelectronics manufacturing of the future.

TI <SUP>229</SUP>ThF<sub>4</sub> thin films for solid-state nuclear clocks
SO NATURE
LA English
DT Article
ID SPONTANEOUS EMISSION; TRANSITION; TARGETS; EXCITATION
AB After nearly 50 years of searching, the vacuum ultraviolet 229Th nuclear isomeric transition has recently been directly laser excited1,2 and measured with high spectroscopic precision3. Nuclear clocks based on this transition are expected to be more robust4,5 than and may outperform6,7 current optical atomic clocks. These clocks also promise sensitive tests for new physics beyond the standard model5,8, 9, 10, 11-12. In light of these important advances and applications, a substantial increase in the need for 229Th spectroscopy targets in several platforms is anticipated. However, the growth and handling of high-concentration 229Th-doped crystals5 used in previous measurements1, 2-3,13,14 are challenging because of the scarcity and radioactivity of the 229Th material. Here we demonstrate a potentially scalable solution to these problems by performing laser excitation of the nuclear transition in 229ThF4 thin films grown using a physical vapour deposition process, consuming only micrograms of 229Th material. The 229ThF4 thin films are intrinsically compatible with photonics platforms and nanofabrication tools for integration with laser sources and detectors, paving the way for an integrated and field-deployable solid-state nuclear clock with radioactivity up to three orders of magnitude smaller than typical 229Th-doped crystals1, 2-3,13. The high nuclear emitter density in 229ThF4 also potentially enables quantum optics studies in a new regime. Finally, we present the estimation of the performance of a nuclear clock based on a defect-free ThF4 crystal.

AB In this paper, we investigate the mmWave beam tracking for vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications to find the optimal beam via sub-6 GHz channel state information (CSI). We consider two scenarios: 1) sub-6 GHz and mmWave transceivers are co-located on the same base station (BS), and 2) sub-6 GHz and mmWave BSs are separated in different places constituting heterogeneous networks (HetNets) where one sub-6 GHz BS controls multiple mmWave BSs. Considering the mobility of the vehicle and time-varying channels, we propose a predictive beam tracking method based on long short-term memory (LSTM) to construct the maps from historical sequential sub-6 GHz CSI to the future optimal mmWave beam. A single LSTM model can handle the beam tracking in the co-located scenario, since there is a one-to-one correspondence between the sub-6 GHz and mmWave transceivers, and the propagation of sub-6 GHz and mmWave signals is similar. However, in the HetNet scenario, it is difficult to select the best one among the beams of multiple mmWave BSs only via the CSI of one sub-6 GHz BS. To address this challenge, we design an LSTM fusion model, which exploits not only the historical sequential sub-6 GHz CSI but also a number of mmWave wide beam measurements, to obtain the optimal mmWave BS and beam in the HetNet. In this case, the collected sub-6 GHz CSI and mmWave wide beam measurements are analyzed by the LSTM and fully connected network (FCN) modules, respectively, providing two beam prediction results. Then the results are fused by an attention-based FCN module to accomplish the final prediction. Simulation results verify the effectiveness and superiority of our LSTM-based beam tracking models compared with other state-of-the-art deep learning beam tracking models that also leverage sub-6 GHz channels. Besides, the robustness and generalization of our proposed LSTM models are illustrated through simulations.

AB Lithium diffusivity at the grain boundaries of solid electrolytes (SEs) can strongly impact the final performance of all-solid-state Li ion batteries (SSLBs). beta-Li3PS4 (beta-LPS) is a promising SE due to its good formability and low processing cost, but its total Li ionic conductivity can vary by orders of magnitude depending on the synthesis and processing conditions. One of the possible sources for this variability, the GB contribution, is still poorly understood to date. In this study, we systematically investigate the Li ion transport in tilt and twist GBs as well as amorphous/crystal interfaces of beta-LPS by performing large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with a highly accurate moment tensor interatomic potential (MTP). We find that the Li ion conductivities at the GBs and amorphous/crystal interfaces (10(-4)-10(-3) S cm(-1)) are 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than that in the bulk crystal (10(-5) S cm(-1)). The Li ion diffusivity at twist GBs and amorphous/crystal interfaces shows no correlation with the degree of diffusion isotropy, while tilt GBs exhibit a negative correlation. Using topological data analysis, the Li pathway network in twist GBs and amorphous/crystal interfaces comprises persisting large Li ring sub-networks (n(Li) >= 5) that closely resemble those found in the bulk amorphous structure, whereas more smaller and short-lived Li ring sub-networks (n(Li) <= 5) are detected in tilt GBs and the bulk crystal. The concentration of persisting large Li ring sub-networks in the GB and amorphous/crystal interfaces is directly proportional to the degree of Li site disordering which in turn correlates with GB conductivity. Our findings provide useful insights that can guide the optimization of conductivity not only in beta-LPS but also in other sulfide-type solid electrolytes through possible GB engineering.

ID MANAGEMENT; STABILITY
AB With the rapid development of autonomous driving and edge computing, vehicular edge computing (VEC) has become an emerging paradigm that allows vehicles with abundant computational resources to work as edge nodes. By introducing vehicles as infrastructures, VEC has the potential to improve users' quality of experience and decrease operator's deployment expenditure, especially for hot spots. In this article, a novel VEC-based resource reservation framework is designed to handle the time-varying computation requests. To articulate realistic scenarios, the online durations of provider vehicles (PVs) are assumed to be different. Besides, the PVs will not always be online to wait for the reservation assignment for the limited revenue, i.e., the PVs are dynamic and the computational resource reservation points (CRRPs) are static. In this way, dynamic matching is leveraged to model the interaction between the PVs and CRRPs. To prevent the CRRPs from manipulating their preferences for better partners, a strategy-proof and stable resource reservation algorithm is proposed to ensure all CRRPs are truthful during the resource reservation procedure. Finally, numerical simulation results are presented to validate the proofness, truthfulness, and performance of our proposed resource reservation algorithm.

AB We ally steady-state kinetics, kinetic isotope effects, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to illustrate that Cu-based catalysts remain saturated by H-adatoms (H*) and molecular formic acid (HCOOH**) during CO2 hydrogenation. High H* coverage under methanol synthesis conditions is evidenced by reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) rates that exhibit positive H2 reaction orders only at PH2 less than or similar to 0.5 bar, above which methanol synthesis and RWGS rates exhibit first and zeroth order dependence on PH2, respectively. HCOOH** also accumulates on the surface with increasing PCO2 as informed by the Langmuir-type dependence on PCO2 (0.25-23 bar) for both methanol synthesis and RWGS. As both HCOOH** and H* have one H-atom per site occupied, the two species share the same PH2 dependence and give rise to CO2 reaction orders that are independent of PH2. Surface coverages determined based on kinetic analyses are further corroborated with DFT-derived adsorption energies that show favorable HCOOH** adsorbate-adsorbate interactions as well as repulsive interactions for bidentate formate (HCOO**) on H*-saturated surfaces. Methanol selectivity remains invariant with PCO2 and PCO despite CO inhibiting reaction rates, thereby demonstrating methanol synthesis and RWGS occur on the same active site. In contrast, water preferentially inhibits methanol synthesis rates, increases methanol synthesis H2 reaction order from 1.0 to 1.5, and alters the methanol synthesis H2/D2 kinetic isotope effect; the inhibitory effect of H2O thus cannot be attributed to competitive adsorption alone and instead reflects a change in the rate-determining step for methanol synthesis. The disparate kinetics of methanol synthesis and RWGS evince a branching pathway where methanol is formed from formates and CO is formed from carboxylates. The presented work thus identifies the relevant surface species, underscores the distinct catalytic role of water in branching methanol synthesis and RWGS pathways, and, in doing so, details a mechanistic picture that yields predictable rates and reaction orders for both methanol synthesis and RWGS on Cu-based CO2 hydrogenation catalysts.

TI Potential energy landscape formalism for quantum molecular liquids
SO COMMUNICATIONS CHEMISTRY

AB The potential energy landscape (PEL) formalism is a powerful tool within statistical mechanics to study the thermodynamic properties of classical low-temperature liquids and glasses. Recently, the PEL formalism has been extended to liquids/glasses that obey quantum mechanics, but applications have been limited to atomistic model liquids. In this work, we extend the PEL formalism to liquid/glassy water using path-integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations, where nuclear quantum effects (NQE) are included. Our PIMD simulations, based on the q-TIP4P/F water model, show that the PEL of quantum water is both Gaussian and anharmonic. Importantly, the ring-polymers associated to the O/H atoms in the PIMD simulations, collapse at the local minima of the PEL (inherent structures, IS) for both liquid and glassy states. This allows us to calculate, analytically, the IS vibrational density of states (IS-VDOS) of the ring-polymer system using the IS-VDOS of classical water (obtained from classical MD simulations). The role of NQE on the structural properties of liquid/glassy water at various pressures are discussed in detail. Overall, our results demonstrate that the PEL formalism can effectively describe the behavior of molecular liquids at low temperatures and in the glass states, regardless of whether the liquid/glass obeys classical or quantum mechanics.

AB Edge computing has been introduced as a promising technology for real-time video streaming systems. However, due to the lack of automatic incentives and the limitation of resources, traditional edge computing performs poorly in nowadays scenarios. To handle these two challenges, we propose a framework of Joint Incentive design and Resource Allocation (JIRA) for edge-based real-time video streaming systems. Technically, to ensure the trust and automatic distribution of incentives, we develop a novel smart contract based incentive mechanism and implement a prototype. Meanwhile, we propose an efficient online algorithm, i.e., JIRA, which dynamically adjusts compression ratio, offloading decision, and resource allocation to achieve performance optimization for video streaming under long-term latency and resource constraints. Specifically, JIRA is based on Lyapunov optimization, which decomposes the challenging long-term decision problem into a series of real-time optimization problems. Then we propose a multi-cut Generalized Benders Decomposition based algorithm (MGA) to tackle the non-convexity of the decomposed problem. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we prove the performance bound of JIRA. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed schemes can achieve an efficient trade-off between accuracy performance and energy consumption.

AB With the rapidly increasing number of bandwidth-intensive terminals capable of intelligent computing and communication, such as smart devices equipped with shallow neural network (NN) models, the complexity of multiple access (MA) for these intelligent terminals is increasing due to the dynamic network environment and ubiquitous connectivity in sixth-generation (6G) systems. Traditional MA design and optimization methods are gradually losing ground to artificial intelligence (AI) techniques that have proven their superiority in handling complexity. AI-empowered MA and its optimization strategies aimed at achieving high quality-of-service (QoS) are attracting more attention, especially in the area of latency-sensitive applications in 6G systems. In this work, we aim to: 1) present the development and comparative evaluation of AI-enabled MA; 2) provide a timely survey focusing on spectrum sensing, protocol design, and optimization for AI-empowered MA; and 3) explore the potential use cases of AI-empowered MA in the typical application scenarios within 6G systems. Specifically, we first present a unified framework of AI-empowered MA for 6G systems by incorporating various promising machine learning (ML) techniques in spectrum sensing, resource allocation, MA protocol design, and optimization. We then introduce AI-empowered MA spectrum sensing related to spectrum sharing and spectrum interference management. Next, we discuss the AI-empowered MA protocol designs and implementation methods by reviewing and comparing the state of the art and further explore the optimization algorithms related to dynamic resource management, parameter adjustment, and access scheme switching. Finally, we discuss the current challenges, point out open issues, and outline potential future research directions in this field.

AB The prospect of creating ferroelectric or high permittivity nanomaterials provides motivation for investigating complex transition metal oxides of the form Ba(Ti, M-V)O-3, where M = Nb or Ta. Solid state processing typically produces mixtures of crystalline phases, rarely beyond minimally doped Nb/Ta. Using a modified sol-gel method, we prepared single phase nanocrystals of Ba(Ti, M)O-3. Compositional and elemental analysis puts the empirical formulas close to BaTi0.5Nb0.5O3-delta and BaTi0.5Ta0.5O3-delta. For both materials, a reversible temperature dependent phase transition (non-centrosymmetric to symmetric) is observed in the Raman spectrum in the region 533-583 K (260-310 degrees C); for Ba(Ti, Nb)O-3, the onset is at 543 K (270 degrees C); and for Ba(Ti, Ta)O-3, the onset is at 533 K (260 degrees C), which are comparable with 390-393 K (117-120 degrees C) for bulk BaTiO3. The crystal structure was resolved by examination of the powder x-ray diffraction and atomic pair distribution function (PDF) analysis of synchrotron total scattering data. It was postulated whether the structure adopted at the nanoscale was single or double perovskite. Double perovskites (A(2)B ' B '' O-6) are characterized by the type and extent of cation ordering, which gives rise to higher symmetry crystal structures. PDF analysis was used to examine all likely candidate structures and to look for evidence of higher symmetry. The feasible phase space that evolves includes the ordered double perovskite structure Ba-2(Ti, M-V)O-6 (M = Nb, Ta) Fm-3m, a disordered cubic structure, as a suitable high temperature analog, Ba(Ti, M-V)O3Pm-3m, and an orthorhombic Ba(Ti, M-V)O(3)Amm2, a room temperature structure that presents an unusually high level of lattice displacement, possibly due to octahedral tilting, and indication of a highly polarized crystal.

ID NEURAL-NETWORKS; REINFORCEMENT; MODEL
AB Neuroscience has long been an essential driver of progress in artificial intelligence (AI). We propose that to accelerate progress in AI, we must invest in fundamental research in NeuroAI. A core component of this is the embodied Turing test, which challenges AI animal models to interact with the sensorimotor world at skill levels akin to their living counterparts. The embodied Turing test shifts the focus from those capabilities like game playing and language that are especially well-developed or uniquely human to those capabilities - inherited from over 500 million years of evolution - that are shared with all animals. Building models that can pass the embodied Turing test will provide a roadmap for the next generation of AI.

TI Structure, Bonding, and Vibrational Dynamics of a Triamine High Energy
   Density Material under Pressure
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C

DT Article
ID DIAMOND-ANVIL CELL; SPECTROSCOPY
AB High energy density materials have complex intermolecular interactions which influence their stability and performance. We used a combination of synchrotron X-ray diffraction, synchrotron infrared spectroscopy, and Raman vibrational spectroscopy, supplemented by density functional theory calculations, to probe pressure-induced changes in structure and intermolecular interactions of 1H,4 ' H-[3,3 '-bis(1,2,4-triazole)]-4 ',5,5 '-triamine as a model high energy density material up to 40 GPa. We find that compression of the triamine is accompanied by increased intermolecular interactions that give rise to an interesting evolution of the structure and bonding with pressure. Analysis of the equation of state determined from the X-ray diffraction indicates a change in compression mechanism near 19 GPa consistent with changes in vibrational spectra that provide evidence for a structural rearrangement associated with changes in hydrogen bonding near that pressure. The overall compressional behavior calculated theoretically agrees with that observed experimentally though differences are found that indicate the need for improved treatment of the intermolecular interactions including hydrogen bonding under pressure.

AB Cognitive non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) have been envisioned as two promising technologies for vehicle to everything (V2X) networks. This paper considers an RIS-aided V2X network with cognitive NOMA in the presence of a malicious eavesdropper while taking into account the imperfect channel information (ipCSI) due to the mobility of the vehicles. The new approximate and asymptotic outage probabilities (OP) and intercept probabilities (IP) expressions of the considered system are derived over double Rayleigh fading channels. The asymptotic OP and IP expressions are subsequently utilized to quantify the diversity orders achieved by vehicular users. Numerical and Monte Carlo simulation results are presented to corroborate the analysis. The simulation results show that ipCSI has significant but different impact on the OP and IP performance to the far user and the near user, which are also different under different number of reflecting units. We show that there is a trade-off between security and reliability, which can be improved by increasing the number of reflecting units of RIS. Specifically, the valuable finding is that the OP performance of the near user will not always be better than that of far user due to the impact of ipCSI, which shows that the power allocation needs to be reconsidered in order to serve the near user more better in the actual scenarios.

AB To solve the spatial problems of mapping, localization and navigation, the mammalian lineage has developed striking spatial representations. One important spatial representation is the Nobel-prize winning grid cells: neurons that represent self-location, a local and aperiodic quantity, with seemingly bizarre non-local and spatially periodic activity patterns of a few discrete periods. Why has the mammalian lineage learnt this peculiar grid representation? Mathematical analysis suggests that this multi-periodic representation has excellent properties as an algebraic code with high capacity and intrinsic error-correction, but to date, synthesis of multi-modular grid cells in deep recurrent neural networks remains absent. In this work, we begin by identifying key insights from four families of approaches to answering the grid cell question: dynamical systems, coding theory, function optimization and supervised deep learning. We then leverage our insights to propose a new approach that elegantly combines the strengths of all four approaches. Our approach is a self-supervised learning (SSL) framework - including data, data augmentations, loss functions and a network architecture - motivated from a normative perspective, with no access to supervised position information. Without making assumptions about internal or readout representations, we show that multiple grid cell modules can emerge in networks trained on our SSL framework and that the networks generalize significantly beyond their training distribution. This work contains insights for neuroscientists interested in the origins of grid cells as well as machine learning researchers interested in novel SSL frameworks.

TI Significance of Energy Conservation in Coupled-Trajectory Approaches to

SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION

ID MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; SURFACE; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; EQUATION
AB Through approximating electron-nuclear correlation terms in the exact factorization approach, trajectory-based methods have been derived and successfully applied to the dynamics of a variety of light-induced molecular processes, capturing quantum (de)-coherence effects rigorously. These terms account for the coupling among the trajectories, recovering the nonlocal nature of quantum nuclear dynamics that is completely overlooked in traditional independent-trajectory algorithms. Nevertheless, some of the approximations introduced in the derivation of some of these methods do not conserve the total energy. We analyze energy conservation in the coupled-trajectory mixed quantum-classical (CTMQC) algorithm and explore the performance of a modified algorithm, CTMQC-E, where some of the terms are redefined to restore energy conservation. A set of molecular models is used as a test, namely, 2-cis-penta-2,4-dienimium cation, bis-(methylene) adamantyl radical cation, butatriene cation, uracil radical cation, and neutral pyrazine.

TI Diverging responses of terrestrial ecosystems to water stress after

SO NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE

DT Article

AB Terrestrial ecosystems are major carbon (C) pools, sequestering similar to 20% of anthropogenic C emissions. However, increasing frequency and intensity of climate-sensitive disturbances (for example, drought and wildfire) threaten long-term C uptake. Although direct effects of disturbances are well-documented, indirect effects remain unknown. Here we quantify changes in the sensitivity of terrestrial gross primary production to water stress before and after severe droughts and fires. We find divergent changes across the globe, where dry regions have increased sensitivity, while wet regions have decreased sensitivity. Water availability, solar radiation, nutrient availability and biodiversity are the main drivers mediating these changes. Sensitivity takes similar to 4-5 years to recover after disturbances, but the increasing frequency of disturbances threatens this recovery. Our results reveal strong cross-system discrepancies in ecosystem responses to disturbances, highlighting the vulnerability of dryland ecosystems in future climates.

ID GENE CLUSTERS; BIOSYNTHESIS; PREDICTION; DISCOVERY; ENZYMES
AB Plant natural products (PNPs) play important roles in plant physiology and have been applied across diverse fields of human society. Understanding their biosynthetic pathways informs plant evolution and meanwhile enables sustainable production through metabolic engineering. However, the discovery of PNP biosynthetic pathways remains challenging due to the diversity of enzymes involved and limitations in traditional gene mining approaches. In this review, we will summarize state-of-the-art strategies and recent examples for predicting and characterizing PNP biosynthetic pathways, respectively, with multiomics-guided tools and heterologous host systems and share our perspectives on the systematic pipelines integrating these various bioinformatic and biochemical approaches.

TI Quantum Sensing of Spin Dynamics Using Boron-Vacancy Centers in
   Hexagonal Boron Nitride
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
ID DEFECTS
AB Spin defects embedded in solid-state systems are appealing for quantum sensing of materials and for quantum science and engineering. The spin-sensitive photoluminescence of optically active spin defects in Van der Waals based materials, such as the boron-vacancy (V-B) - B ) center in hexagonal boron nitride, enables its application as a quantum sensor to detect weak, spatially localized magnetic static and dynamic fields. However, the utility of V - B centers to probe spin dynamics in magnetic systems has yet to be demonstrated; this is essential to establish the V - B as a modular sensing platform that can be seamlessly integrated with emergent quantum materials to probe a wide range of static and dynamic phenomena. Here, we use V - B centers to experimentally probe uniform mode magnon dynamics and optically perform ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy on a thin magnetic film.

AB We employed non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations and theoretical predictions to elucidate organic solvent and water transport mechanisms in dense polymer membranes. Our study investigated the transport of water and 14 organic solvents across 16 dense polymer membranes with varying fractional free volumes. Simulations demonstrated that the dependence of organic solvent or water flux on applied pressure exhibited minimal deviation from linearity, contrary to the prediction of a "ceiling flux" at high pressures, based on the solution-diffusion model. Notably, our findings underscore the paramount influence of solvent size and membrane pore size on solvent permeance, significantly diverging from the solvent solubility-based predictions of the solution-diffusion model. Overall, our results agree with the solution-friction model for characterizing water and organic solvent transport in dense polymer membranes such as reverse osmosis and organic solvent nanofiltration. These fundamental insights into the transport mechanisms of water and organic solvents offer molecular-level guidance for designing next-generation high-performance polymer membranes for various separation applications.

AB Integrating digital twins (DTs) and multi-access edge computing (MEC) is a promising technology that realizes edge intelligence in 6 G, which has been recognized as the key enabler for Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). In this paper, we explore a DT-assisted MEC system for the IIoT scenario where a DT server is created as a virtual representation of the physical MEC server, via estimating the computation state of the MEC server within the DT modelling cycle. To achieve spectrally efficient offloading, we consider that IIoT devices communicate with industrial gateways (IGWs) through a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) protocol. Each IIoT device has an industrial computation task that can be executed locally or fully offloaded to IGW. We aim to minimize the total task completion delay of all IIoT devices by jointly optimizing the IGW's subchannel assignment as well as the computation capacity allocation, edge association, and transmit power allocation of IIoT device. The resulting problem is shown to be a mixed integer non-convex optimization problem, which is NP-hard and challenging to solve. We decompose the original problem into four solvable sub-problems, and then propose an overall alternating optimization algorithm to solve the sub-problems iteratively until convergence. Validated via simulations, the proposed scheme shows superiority to the benchmarks in reducing the total task completion delay and increasing the percentage of offloading IIoT devices.

AB Remote first-aid treatment on ambulances is a promising application of 5G. However, there still exist gaps between the capabilities of current 5G networks and the stringent requirements of remote emergency on ambulances. Dual connectivity (DC) is an efficient technology to fill these gaps by integrating 5G millimeter wave (mmWave) with Sub-6GHz networks. In this paper, we investigate a dual-connectivity handover scheme to enhance the transmission rate of the wireless links for a 5G-enabled ambulance. Due to the long delay caused by signal transmission and processing, the conventional handover schemes based on reference signal received power (RSRP) measured by users are not sufficiently sensitive to the rapidly changing propagation environments surrounding the 5G-enabled ambulance. Instead, considering the randomness of environments and the delay caused by the handover process, we employ a deep Q network (DQN)-based algorithm to find a far-sighted policy for solving the handover problem. However, due to the drawbacks of single-step bootstrapping, value overestimation, and low-efficiency exploration, the vanilla DQN is performance-limited. To this end, we adopt effective techniques including multi-step learning, double DQN, and NoisyNet to improve learning performances, and propose a noisy double DQN (NDDQN)-based dual-connectivity handover scheme. Simulation results verify the effectiveness and superiority of our NDDQN-based handover scheme compared with the vanilla DQN and upper confidence bound (UCB)-based handover schemes, and then show that our handover scheme can adapt to various handover models.

TI Branch-cut in the shear-stress response function of massless )φ4 with
   Boltzmann statistics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
LA English
DT Article
ID THERMODYNAMICS
AB Using an analytical result for the eigensystem of the linearized collision term for a classical system of massless scalar particles with quartic self-interactions, we show that the shear-stress linear response function possesses a branch-cut singularity that covers the whole positive imaginary semiaxis. This is demonstrated in two ways: (1) by truncating the exact, infinite system of linear equations for the rank-two tensor modes, which reveals the cut touching the origin; and (2) by employing the Trotterization techniques to invert the linear response problem. The former shows that the first pole tends toward the origin and the average separation between consecutive poles tends toward zero as power laws in the dimension of the basis. The latter allows one to obtain the response function in closed form in terms of Tricomi hypergeometrical functions, which possess a branch-cut on the above-mentioned semiaxis. This suggests that the presence of a cut along the imaginary frequency axis of the shear stress correlator, inferred from previous numerical analyses of weakly coupled scalar lambda phi 4 theories, does not arise due to quantum statistics but instead emerges from the fundamental properties of this system's interactions.

AB Background: Frequent sensor-assisted monitoring of changes in swallowing function may help improve detection of radiation -associated dysphagia before it becomes permanent. While our group has prototyped an epidermal strain/surface electromyography sensor that can detect minute changes in swallowing muscle movement, it is unknown whether patients with head and neck cancer would be willing to wear such a device at home after radiation for several months. Objective: We iteratively assessed patients' design preferences and perceived barriers to long -term use of the prototype sensor. Methods: In study 1 (questionnaire only), survivors of pharyngeal cancer who were 3-5 years post treatment and part of a larger prospective study were asked their design preferences for a hypothetical throat sensor and rated their willingness to use the sensor at home during the first year after radiation. In studies 2 and 3 (iterative user testing), patients with and survivors of head and neck cancer attending visits at MD Anderson's Head and Neck Cancer Center were recruited for two rounds of on-throat testing with prototype sensors while completing a series of swallowing tasks. Afterward, participants were asked about their willingness to use the sensor during the first year post radiation. In study 2, patients also rated the sensor's ease of use and comfort, whereas in study 3, preferences were elicited regarding haptic feedback. Results: The majority of respondents in study 1 (116/138, 84%) were willing to wear the sensor 9 months after radiation, and participant willingness rates were similar in studies 2 (10/14, 71.4%) and 3 (12/14, 85.7%). The most prevalent reasons for participants' unwillingness to wear the sensor were 9 months being excessive, unwanted increase in responsibility, and feeling self-conscious. Across all three studies, the sensor's ability to detect developing dysphagia increased willingness the most compared to its appearance and ability to increase adherence to preventive speech pathology exercises. Direct haptic signaling was also rated highly, especially to indicate correct sensor placement and swallowing exercise performance. Conclusions: Patients and survivors were receptive to the idea of wearing a personalized risk sensor for an extended period during the first year after radiation, although this may have been limited to well-educated non -Hispanic participants. A significant minority of patients expressed concern with various aspects of the sensor's burden and its appearance.

TI Cosmic ray-boosted dark matter at IceCube
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
LA English
DT Article
AB Cosmic ray (CR) upscattering of dark matter is considered as one of the most straightforward mechanisms to accelerate ambient dark matter, making it detectable at high threshold, large volume experiments. In this work, we revisit CR upscattered dark matter signals at the IceCube detector, focusing on lower energy data than was considered before. We consider both scattering with electrons and nuclei. In the latter, we include both elastic and deep-inelastic scattering computations. As concrete examples, we consider two benchmark models; fermion dark matter with vector and scalar mediators. We compare our model projections with the most current constraints and show that the IceCube detector can detect CRboosted dark matter especially with masses below similar to 100 keV when scattering with electrons and similar to MeV in the nucleon scattering case.

AB Inorganic-organic mesophase materials provide a wide range of tunable properties, which are often highly dependent on their nano-, micro-, or meso-scale compositions and structures. Among these are macroscopic orientational order and corresponding anisotropic material properties, the adjustability of which are difficult to achieve. This is due to the complicated transient and coupled transport, chemical reaction, and surface processes that occur during material syntheses. By understanding such processes, general criteria are established and used to prepare diverse mesostructured materials with highly aligned channels with uniform nanometer dimensions and controllable directionalities over macroscopic dimensions and thicknesses. This is achieved by using a micropatterned semipermeable poly(dimethylsiloxane) stamp to manage the rates, directions, and surfaces at which self-assembling phases nucleate and the directions that they grow. This enables mesostructured surfactant-directed silica and titania composites, including with functional guest species, and mesoporous carbons to be prepared with high degrees of hexagonal order, as well as controllable orthogonal macroscopic orientational order. The resulting materials exhibit novel anisotropic properties, as demonstrated by the example of direction-dependent photocurrent generation, and are promising for enhancing the functionality of inorganic-organic nanocomposite materials in separations, catalysis, and energy conversion applications.
   High and controllable degrees of macroscopic orientational ordering are demonstrated for mesostructured silica, titania, and carbon films. Judicious selection of synthesis conditions enables the control of the directions and relative rates of solvent removal, surfactant self-assembly, inorganic-oxide cross-linking, and the surfaces at which mesophases grow. The materials exhibit anisotropic properties for applications in separations, catalysis, and energy conversion.image

AB Multimessenger searches for binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron star-black hole (NSBH) mergers are currently one of the most exciting areas of astronomy. The search for joint electromagnetic and neutrino counterparts to gravitational wave (GW)s has support this effort, public semiautomated data products are sent in near real-time and include localization and source properties to guide complementary observations. In preparation for O4, we have conducted a study using a simulated population of compact binaries and a mock data challenge (MDC) in the form of a real-time replay to optimize and profile the software infrastructure and scientific deliverables. End-toend performance was tested, including data ingestion, running online search pipelines, performing annotations, and issuing alerts to the astrophysics community. We present an overview of the low-latency infrastructure and the performance of the data products that are now being released during O4 based on the MDC. We report the expected median latency for the preliminary alert of full bandwidth searches (29.5 s) and show consistency and accuracy of released data products using the MDC. We report the expected median latency for triggers from early warning searches (-3.1 s), which are new in O4 and target neutron star mergers during inspiral phase. This paper provides a performance overview for LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) low-latency alert infrastructure and data products using the MDC and serves as a useful reference for the interpretation of O4 detections.

TI Electron-Phonon Interaction Mediated Gigantic Enhancement of
   Thermoelectric Power Factor Induced by Topological Phase Transition

AB We propose an effective strategy to significantly enhance the thermoelectric power factor (PF) of a series of 2D semimetals and semiconductors by driving them toward a topological phase transition (TPT). Employing first-principles calculations with an explicit consideration of electron-phonon interactions, we analyze the electronic transport properties of germanene across the TPT by applying hydrogenation and biaxial strain. We reveal that the nontrivial semimetal phase, hydrogenated germanene with 8% biaxial strain, achieves a considerable 4-fold PF enhancement, attributed to the highly asymmetric electronic structure and semimetallic nature of the nontrivial phase. We extend the strategy to another two representative 2D materials (stanene and HgSe) and observe a similar trend, with a marked 7-fold and 5-fold increase in PF, respectively. The wide selection of functional groups, universal applicability of biaxial strain, and broad spectrum of 2D semimetals and semiconductors render our approach highly promising for designing novel 2D materials with superior thermoelectric performance.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Real-time transmission of remote sensing data is critical for many applications. The rapid enhancement in sensing capabilities has posed challenges in sending large volumes of collected information to users on the ground in a timely manner. Deployed with inter-satellite links (ISLs), low-earth-orbit mega-constellations can facilitate the relay of remote sensing data to ground stations. However, due to scarce spectrum resources, increasing data throughput remains a challenge. Towards this, we explore multi-path transmission of real-time remote sensing data via heterogeneous ISLs, with the aim of maximizing data transmission throughput. We formulate the problem of multi-path transmission via heterogeneous ISLs as a linear programming problem, and find that its complexity is exacerbated when dealing with large-scale satellite networks. Therefore, we present an alternative approach using graph theory, transforming the problem into a classical maximum flow problem. This approach ensures optimal resolution of the original problem within polynomial time. Simulations conducted on the Gaofen and Starlink constellation demonstrate the performance benefits of our approach regarding both time complexity and throughput.

AB Using both time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) and the "single-shot" GW plus Bethe-Salpeter equation (GW-BSE) approach, we compute optical band gaps and optical absorption spectra from first principles for eight common binary and ternary closed-shell metal oxides (MgO, Al2O3, CaO, TiO2, Cu2O, ZnO, BaSnO3, and BiVO4), based on the nonempirical Wannier-localization-based, optimally tuned, screened range-separated hybrid functional. Overall, we find excellent agreement between our TDDFT and GW-BSE results and ex-periment, with a mean absolute error smaller than 0.4 eV, including for Cu2O and ZnO that are traditionally considered to be challenging for both methods.

TI Evaluating large language models on medical evidence summarization
SO NPJ DIGITAL MEDICINE

DT Article
AB Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable successes in zero- and few-shot performance on various downstream tasks, paving the way for applications in high-stakes domains. In this study, we systematically examine the capabilities and limitations of LLMs, specifically GPT-3.5 and ChatGPT, in performing zero-shot medical evidence summarization across six clinical domains. We conduct both automatic and human evaluations, covering several dimensions of summary quality. Our study demonstrates that automatic metrics often do not strongly correlate with the quality of summaries. Furthermore, informed by our human evaluations, we define a terminology of error types for medical evidence summarization. Our findings reveal that LLMs could be susceptible to generating factually inconsistent summaries and making overly convincing or uncertain statements, leading to potential harm due to misinformation. Moreover, we find that models struggle to identify the salient information and are more error-prone when summarizing over longer textual contexts.

AB Microwave impedance microscopy (MIM) has been utilized to directly visualize topological edge states in many quantum materials. While the microwave response for conventional metals and insulators can be accurately quantified using simple lumped-element circuits, whose applicability to more exotic quantum systems remain limited. In this work, we present a general theoretical framework of the MIM response of arbitrary quantum materials. Applying it to topological edge states in a Chern insulator predicts an enhanced MIM response at the crystal boundaries due to collective edge magnetoplasmon (EMP) excitations. The unique resonance frequency of these plasmonic modes allows one to disentangle the signatures of topological versus trivial edge states. To benchmark our analytical predictions, we experimentally probe the MIM response of quantum anomalous Hall edge states in a Cr-doped (Bi, Sb)(2)Te-3 topological insulator and perform numerical simulations using a classical formulation of the EMP modes based on this realistic tip-sample geometry, both of which yield results consistent with our theoretical picture. We also show how the technique of MIM can be used to quantitatively extract the topological invariant of a Chern insulator and shed light on the microscopic nature of dissipation along the crystal boundaries.

AB Enol silyl ethers are versatile, robust, and readily accessible substrates widely used in chemical synthesis. However, the conventional reactivity of these motifs has been limited to classical two electron (2-e) enolate-type chemistry with electrophilic partners or as radical acceptors in one electron (1-e) reactivity leading, in both cases, to exclusive alpha-monofunctionalization of carbonyls. Herein we describe a mild, fast, and operationally simple one-step protocol that combines readily available fluoroalkyl halides, silyl enol ethers, and, for the first time, hetero(aryl) Grignard reagents to promote selective dicarbofunctionalization of enol silyl ethers. From a broader perspective, this work expands the synthetic utility of enol silyl ethers and establishes bisphosphine-iron catalysis as enabling technology capable of orchestrating selective C-C bond formations with short-lived alpha-silyloxy radicals with practical implications towards sustainable chemical synthesis.
   Herein, we report the dicarbofunctionalization of enol silyl ethers via an Fe-catalyzed decoupled cross-coupling of (fluoro)alkyl halides, and enol silyl ethers.

TI Precision mass measurements of 74-76Sr using the multiple reflection

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW C

DT Article
ID RP-PROCESS; STATES
AB We report precision mass measurements of 74-76Sr performed with the TITAN multiple-reflection time-of- flight mass spectrometer. This marks a first-time mass measurement of 74Sr and gives increased mass precision to both 75Sr and 76Sr, which were previously measured using storage ring and Penning trap methods, respectively. This completes the A = 74, T = 1 isospin triplet and gives increased precision to the A = 75, T = 1/2 isospin doublet, which are both the heaviest experimentally evaluated triplets and doublets to date. The new data allow us to evaluate coefficients of the isobaric multiplet mass equation for the first time at A = 74 and with increased precision at A = 75. With increased precision of 75Sr, we confirm the recent measurement reported by CSRe that was used to remove a staggering anomaly in the doublets. New ab initio valence-space in-medium similarity renormalization group calculations of the T = 1 triplet are presented at A = 74. We also investigate the impact of the new mass data on the reaction flow of the rapid proton capture process in type I x-ray bursts using a single-zone model.

AB DNA nanotechnology has emerged as a powerful approach to engineering biophysical tools, therapeutics, and diagnostics because it enables the construction of designer nanoscale structures with high programmability. Based on DNA base pairing rules, nanostructure size, shape, surface functionality, and structural reconfiguration can be programmed with a degree of spatial, temporal, and energetic precision that is difficult to achieve with other methods. However, the properties and structure of DNA constructs are greatly altered in vivo due to spontaneous protein adsorption from biofluids. These adsorbed proteins, referred to as the protein corona, remain challenging to control or predict, and subsequently, their functionality and fate in vivo are difficult to engineer. To address these challenges, we prepared a library of diverse DNA nanostructures and investigated the relationship between their design features and the composition of their protein corona. We identified protein characteristics important for their adsorption to DNA nanostructures and developed a machine-learning model that predicts which proteins will be enriched on a DNA nanostructure based on the DNA structures' design features and protein properties. Our work will help to understand and program the function of DNA nanostructures in vivo for biophysical and biomedical applications.

AB We describe a first -principles statistical mechanics method to calculate the free energies of crystalline alloys that depend on temperature, composition, and strain. The approach relies on an extension of the alloy cluster expansion to include an explicit dependence on homogeneous strain in addition to site occupation variables that track the degree of chemical ordering. The method is applied to the Si-Ge binary alloy and is used to calculate free energies that describe phase stability under arbitrary epitaxial constraints. We find that while the incoherent phase diagram (in which coexisting phases are not affected by coherency constraints) hosts a miscibility gap, coherent phase equilibrium predicts ordering and negative enthalpies of mixing. Instead of chemical instability, the chemomechanical free energy exhibits instabilities along directions that couple the composition of the alloy with a volumetric strain order parameter. This has fundamental implications for phase field models of spinodal decomposition as it indicates the importance of gradient energy coefficients that couple gradients in composition with gradients in strain.

AB Nickel K- and L-2,L-3-edge X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) are discussed for 16 complexes and complex ions with nickel centers spanning a range of formal oxidation states from II to IV. K-edge XAS alone is shown to be an ambiguous metric of physical oxidation state for these Ni complexes. Meanwhile, L-2,L-3-edge XAS reveals that the physical d-counts of the formally Ni-IV compounds measured lie well above the d(6) count implied by the oxidation state formalism. The generality of this phenomenon is explored computationally by scrutinizing 8 additional complexes. The extreme case of NiF62- is considered using high-level molecular orbital approaches as well as advanced valence bond methods. The emergent electronic structure picture reveals that even highly electronegative F-donors are incapable of supporting a physical d(6) Ni-IV center. The reactivity of Ni-IV complexes is then discussed, highlighting the dominant role of the ligands in this chemistry over that of the metal centers.

TI Surface molecular engineering to enable processing of sulfide solid
   electrolytes in humid ambient air
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
ID STABILITY; PHASE; CONDUCTIVITY; DESIGN; ORIGIN
AB Sulfide solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) are promising candidates to realize all solid-state batteries (ASSBs) due to their superior ionic conductivity and excellent ductility. However, their hypersensitivity to moisture requires processing environments that are not compatible with today's lithium-ion battery manufacturing infrastructure. Herein, we present a reversible surface modification strategy that enables the processability of sulfide SSEs (e. g., Li6PS5Cl) under humid ambient air. We demonstrate that a long chain alkyl thiol, 1-undecanethiol, is chemically compatible with the electrolyte with negligible impact on its ion conductivity. Importantly, the thiol modification extends the amount of time that the sulfide SSE can be exposed to air with 33% relative humidity (33% RH) with limited degradation of its structure while retaining a conductivity of above 1 mS cm-1 for up to 2 days, a more than 100-fold improvement in protection time over competing approaches. Experimental and computational results reveal that the thiol group anchors to the SSE surface, while the hydrophobic hydrocarbon tail provides protection by repelling water. The modified Li6PS5Cl SSE maintains its function after exposure to ambient humidity when implemented in a Li0.5In | |LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 ASSB. The proposed protection strategy based on surface molecular interactions represents a major step forward towards cost-competitive and energy-efficient sulfide SSE manufacturing for ASSB applications.

AB Dynamin mediates fission of vesicles from the plasma membrane during endocytosis. Typically, dynamin is recruited from the cytosol to endocytic sites, requiring seconds to tens of seconds. However, ultrafast endo-cytosis in neurons internalizes vesicles as quickly as 50 ms during synaptic vesicle recycling. Here, we demonstrate that Dynamin 1 is pre-recruited to endocytic sites for ultrafast endocytosis. Specifically, Dyna-min 1xA, a splice variant of Dynamin 1, interacts with Syndapin 1 to form molecular condensates on the plasma membrane. Single-particle tracking of Dynamin 1xA molecules confirms the liquid-like property of condensates in vivo. When Dynamin 1xA is mutated to disrupt its interaction with Syndapin 1, the conden-sates do not form, and consequently, ultrafast endocytosis slows down by 100-fold. Mechanistically, Synda-pin 1 acts as an adaptor by binding the plasma membrane and stores Dynamin 1xA at endocytic sites. This cache bypasses the recruitment step and accelerates endocytosis at synapses.

AB The gamma-ray Fermi-LAT Galactic Centre excess (GCE) has puzzled scientists for over 15 yr. Despite ongoing debates about its properties, and especially its spatial distribution, its nature remains elusive. We scrutinize how the estimated spatial morphology of this excess depends on models for the Galactic diffuse emission, focusing particularly on the extent to which the Galactic plane and point sources are masked. Our main aim is to compare a spherically symmetric morphology - potentially arising from the annihilation of dark matter (DM) particles - with a boxy morphology - expected if faint unresolved sources in the Galactic bulge dominate the excess emission. Recent claims favouring a DM-motivated template for the GCE are shown to rely on a specific Galactic bulge template, which performs worse than other templates for the Galactic bulge. We find that a non-parametric model of the Galactic bulge derived from the VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea survey results in a significantly better fit for the GCE than DM-motivated templates. This result is independent of whether a galprop-based model or a more non-parametric ring-based model is used to describe the diffuse Galactic emission. This conclusion remains true even when additional freedom is added in the background models, allowing for non-parametric modulation of the model components and substantially improving the fit quality. When adopted, optimized background models provide robust results in terms of preference for a boxy bulge morphology for the GCE, regardless of the mask applied to the Galactic plane.

AB We present the first detailed chemical-abundance analysis of stars from the dwarf-galaxy stellar stream Wukong/LMS-1 covering a wide metallicity range (-3.5 < [Fe/H] less than or similar to -1.3). We find abundance patterns that are effectively indistinguishable from the bulk of Indus and Jhelum, a pair of smaller stellar streams proposed to be dynamically associated with Wukong/LMS-1. We confirmed a carbon-enhanced metal-poor star ([C/Fe] > +0.7 and [Fe/H] similar to -2.9) in Wukong/LMS-1 with strong enhancements in Sr, Y, and Zr, which is peculiar given its solar-level [Ba/Fe]. Wukong/LMS-1 stars have high abundances of alpha elements up to [Fe/H] greater than or similar to -2$, which is expected for relatively massive dwarfs. Towards the high-metallicity end, Wukong/LMS-1 becomes alpha-poor, revealing that it probably experienced fairly standard chemical evolution. We identified a pair of N- and Na-rich stars in Wukong/LMS-1, reminiscent of multiple stellar populations in globular clusters. This indicates that this dwarf galaxy contained at least one globular cluster that was completely disrupted in addition to two intact ones previously known to be associated with Wukong/LMS-1, which is possibly connected to similar evidence found in Indus. From these >= 3 globular clusters, we estimate the total mass of Wukong/LMS-1 to be approximate to 10(10)M(circle dot), representing similar to 1 per cent of the present-day Milky Way. Finally, the [Eu/Mg] ratio in Wukong/LMS-1 continuously increases with metallicity, making this the first example of a dwarf galaxy where the production of r-process elements is clearly dominated by delayed sources, presumably neutron-star mergers.

AB The discovery of new compounds with pharmacological properties is usually a lengthy, laborious and expensive process. Thus, there is increasing interest in developing workflows that allow for the rapid synthesis and evaluation of libraries of compounds with the aim of identifying leads for further drug development. Herein, we apply combinatorial synthesis to build a library of 90 iridium(III) complexes (81 of which are new) over two synthesise-and-test cycles, with the aim of identifying potential agents for photodynamic therapy. We demonstrate the power of this approach by identifying highly active complexes that are well-tolerated in the dark but display very low nM phototoxicity against cancer cells. To build a detailed structure-activity relationship for this class of compounds we have used density functional theory (DFT) calculations to determine some key electronic parameters and study correlations with the experimental data. Finally, we present an optimised semi-automated synthesise-and-test protocol to obtain multiplex data within 72 hours.

AB The Set of Small Ordered Structures (SSOS) approach is an ab initio technique for modelling random solid solutions in which many small structures are averaged so that their correlation functions match those of a desired composition. SSOS has been shown to be effective in reducing the cost of density functional theory calculations relative to other well-known techniques such as cluster expansions and special quasirandom structures for modelling solid solutions. In this work, we demonstrate that SSOS's can be constructed using cells with only a subset of elements while still accurately modelling multi-component systems. Specifically, we show that small binary cells can effectively model two quinary high entropy alloys - NbTaTiHfZr and MoNbTaVW - accurately capturing properties such as formation energy, lattice parameters, elastic constants, and root-meansquare atomic displacements. Overall, this insight is useful for those looking to construct databases of such small structures for predicting the properties of multi-component solid solutions, as it greatly decreases the number of structures that needs to be considered.

AB Peptide-based materials are diverse candidates for self-assembly into modularly designed and stimuli-responsive nanostructures with precisely tunable compositions. Here, we genetically fused computationally designed coiled coil-forming peptides to the N- and C-termini of compositionally distinct multistimuli-responsive resilin-like polypeptides (RLPs) of various lengths. The successful expression of these hybrid polypeptides in bacterial hosts was confirmed through techniques such as gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, and amino acid analysis. Circular dichroism spectroscopy and ultraviolet-visible turbidimetry demonstrated that despite the fusion of disparate structural and responsive units, the coiled coils remained stable in the hybrid polypeptides, and the sequence-encoded differences in thermoresponsive phase separation of the RLPs were preserved. Cryogenic transmission electron microscopy and coarse-grained modeling showed that after thermal annealing in solution, the hybrid polypeptides adopted a closed loop conformation and assembled into nanofibrils capable of further hierarchically organizing into cluster structures and ribbon-like structures mediated by the self-association tendency of the RLPs.

AB Control of electrical doping is indispensable in any semiconductor device, and both efficient hole and electron doping are required for many devices. In organic semiconductors, however, electron doping has been essentially more problematic compared to hole doping because in general organic semiconductors have low electron affinities and require dopants with low ionization potentials that are often air-sensitive. Here, we adapt an efficient molecular doping method, so-called ion-exchange doping, to dope electrons in a polymeric semiconductor. We initially reduce the polymeric semiconductor using one electron transfer from molecular dopants, and then the ionized dopants in the resulting air-unstable films are replaced with secondary ions via cation exchange. Improved ambient stability and crystallinity of the doped polymeric semiconductors are achieved when a specific bulky molecular cation was chosen as the secondary ion, compared to conventional methods. The presented strategy can overcome the trade-off relationship between reducing capability and ambient stability in molecular dopants, and a wider selection of dopant ions will help to realize ambient-stable electron conductors.
   It is difficult to control electron doping in organic semiconductors because they often require dopants that are air-sensitive. Here, an ion-exchange doping method is introduced with improved ambient stability and crystallinity of the doped polymeric semiconductors compared to conventional methods.

AB Dithioalkylidenes are a newly developed class of conjugate acceptors that undergo thiol exchange via an associative mechanism, enabling decoupling of key material properties for sustainability, biomedical, and sensing applications. Here, we show that the ex-change rate is highly sensitive to the structure of the acceptor and tunable over four orders of magnitude in aqueous environments. Cyclic acceptors exchange rapidly, from 0.95 to 15.6 M -1s-1, whereas acyclic acceptors exchange between 3.77 3 10-3 and 2.17 3 10-2 M -1s-1. Computational, spectroscopic, and structural data suggest that cyclic acceptors are more reactive than their acyclic counterparts because of resonance stabilization of the tetrahedral exchange intermediate. We parametrize molecular reactivity with respect to computed descriptors of the electrophilic site and leverage this insight to design a compound with intermediate characteristics. Lastly, we incorporate this dynamic bond into hydrogels and demonstrate that the characteristic stress relaxation time (t) is directly proportional to molecular kex.

SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS

AB Nanophotonics allows to employ light-matter interaction to induce nonlinear optical effects and realize non-conventional memory and computation capabilities, however to date, light-liquid interaction was not considered as a potential mechanism to achieve computation on a nanoscale. Here, we experimentally demonstrate self-induced phase change effect which relies on the coupling between geometric changes of thin liquid film to optical properties of photonic waveguide modes, and then employ it for neuromorphic computing. In our optofluidic silicon photonics system we utilize thermocapillary-based deformation of thin liquid film capable to induce nonlinear effect which is more than one order of magnitude higher compared to the more traditional heat-based thermo-optical effect, and allowing operation as a nonlinear actuator and memory element, both residing at the same compact spatial region. The resulting dynamics allows to implement Reservoir Computing at spatial region which is approximately five orders of magnitude smaller compared to state-of-the-art experimental liquid-based systems.

ID REGULARIZATION
AB Most scientific machine learning (SciML) applications of neural networks involve hundreds to thousands of parameters, and hence, uncertainty quantification for such models is plagued by the curse of dimensionality. Using physical applications, we show that L-0 sparsification prior to Stein variational gradient descent (L-0+SVGD) is a more robust and efficient means of uncertainty quantification, in terms of computational cost and performance than the direct application of SGVD or projected SGVD methods. Specifically, L-0+SVGD demonstrates superior resilience to noise, the ability to perform well in extrapolated regions, and a faster convergence rate to an optimal solution.

AB The "innate-like" T cell compartment, known as T-inn, represents a diverse group of T cells that straddle the boundary between innate and adaptive immunity. We explore the transcriptional landscape of T-inn compared to conventional T cells (T-conv) in the human thymus and blood using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and flow cytometry. In human blood, the majority of T-inn cells share an effector program driven by specific transcription factors, distinct from those governing T-conv cells. Conversely, only a fraction of thymic T-inn cells displays an effector phenotype, while others share transcriptional features with developing T-conv cells, indicating potential divergent developmental pathways. Unlike the mouse, human T-inn cells do not differentiate into multiple effector subsets but develop a mixed type 1/type 17 effector potential. Cross-species analysis uncovers species-specific distinctions, including the absence of type 2 T-inn cells in humans, which implies distinct immune regulatory mechanisms across species.

AB Ligand binding thermodynamics and kinetics are critical parameters for drug design. However, it has proven challenging to efficiently predict ligand binding thermodynamics and kinetics from molecular simulations due to limited simulation timescales. Protein dynamics, especially in the ligand binding pocket, often plays an important role in ligand binding. Based on our previously developed Ligand Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (LiGaMD), here we present LiGaMD2 in which a selective boost potential was applied to both the ligand and protein residues in the binding pocket to improve sampling of ligand binding and dissociation. To validate the performance of LiGaMD2, the T4 lysozyme (T4L) mutants with open and closed pockets bound by different ligands were chosen as model systems. LiGaMD2 could efficiently capture repetitive ligand dissociation and binding within microsecond simulations of all T4L systems. The obtained ligand binding kinetic rates and free energies agreed well with available experimental values and previous modeling results. Therefore, LiGaMD2 provides an improved approach to sample opening of closed protein pockets for ligand dissociation and binding, thereby allowing for efficient calculations of ligand binding thermodynamics and kinetics.

AB Export of sinking particles from the surface ocean is critical for carbon sequestration and to provide energy to the deep biosphere. The magnitude and spatial patterns of this export have been estimated in the past by in situ particle flux observations, satellite-based algorithms, and ocean biogeochemical models; however, these estimates remain uncertain. Here, we use a recent machine learning reconstruction of global ocean particle size distributions (PSDs) from Underwater Vision Profiler 5 measurements to estimate carbon fluxes by sinking particles (35 mu m-5 mm equivalent spherical diameter) from the surface ocean. We combine global maps of PSD properties with empirical relationships constrained against in situ flux observations to calculate particulate carbon export from the euphotic zone (5.8 +/- 0.1 Pg C y(-1)) and annual maximum mixed layer depths (6.1 +/- 0.1 Pg C y(-1)). The new flux reconstructions suggest a less variable seasonal cycle in the tropical ocean and a more persistent export in the Southern Ocean than previously recognized. Smaller particles (less than 418 mu m) contribute most of the flux globally, while larger particles become more important at high latitudes and in tropical upwelling regions. Export from the annual maximum mixed layer exceeds that from the euphotic zone over most of the low-latitude ocean, suggesting shallow particle recycling and net heterotrophy in the deep euphotic zone. These estimates open the way to fully three-dimensional global reconstructions of particle fluxes in the ocean, supported by the growing database of in situ optical observations.

AB The development of electrocatalysts with reduced iridium (Ir) loading for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is essential to produce low-cost green hydrogen from water electrolysis under acidic conditions. Herein, an atomically thin layer of iridium oxide (IrO x ) has been uniformly dispersed onto cobalt oxide (Co3O4) nanocrystals to improve the efficient use of Ir for acidic OER. In situ characterization and theoretical calculations reveal that compared to the conventional IrO x cluster, the atomically thin layer of IrO x shows stronger interaction with the Co3O4 and consequently higher OER activity due to the Ir-O-Co bond formation at the interface. Equally important, the facile synthetic method and the promising activity in the proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer, reaching 1 A cm-2 at 1.7 V with remarkable durability, enable potential scale-up applications. These findings provide a mechanistic understanding for designing active, stable and lower-cost electrocatalysts with well-defined structures for acidic OER.

AB With the rapid development of high-speed railway systems and railway wireless communication, the application of ultra-wideband millimeter wave band is an inevitable trend. However, the millimeter wave channel has large propagation loss and is easy to be blocked. Moreover, there are many problems such as eavesdropping between the base station (BS) and the train. As an emerging technology, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) can achieve the effect of passive beamforming by controlling the propagation of the incident electromagnetic wave in the desired direction. We propose a RIS-assisted scheduling scheme for scheduling interrupt flows and improving quality of service (QoS). In the propsed scheme, an RIS is deployed between the BS and multiple mobile relays (MRs). By jointly optimizing the beamforming vector and the discrete phase shift of the RIS, the constructive interference between direct link signals and reflected link signals can be achieved, and the channel capacity of eavesdroppers is guaranteed to be within a controllable range. Finally, the purpose of maximizing the number of successfully scheduled flows and satisfying their QoS requirements can be practically realized. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed scheme has superior performance regarding the number of completed flows and the system secrecy capacity over four baseline schemes in literature.

AB Water-based coherent detection of broadband terahertz (THz) wave has been recently proposed with superior performances, which can alleviate the limited detection bandwidth and high probe laser energy requirement in the solid-and air-based detection schemes, respectively. Here, we demonstrate that the water-based detection method can be extended to the aqueous salt solutions and the sensitivity can be significantly enhanced. The THz coherent detection signal intensity scales linearly with the third-order nonlinear susceptibility chi(3) or quadratically with the linear refractive index eta 0 of the aqueous salt solutions, while the incoherent detection signal intensity scales quadratically with chi(3) or quartically with eta 0, proving the underlying mechanism is the four-wave mixing. Both the coherent and incoherent detection signal intensities appear positive correlation with the solution concentration. These results imply that the liquid-based THz detection scheme could provide a new technique to measure chi(3) and further investigate the physicochemical properties in the THz band for various liquids.(c) 2022 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Opto-twistronic Hall effect in a three-dimensional spiral lattice

DT Article; Early Access
ID MOIRE; POLARITONS; STACKING
AB Studies of moir & eacute; systems have explained the effect of superlattice modulations on their properties, demonstrating new correlated phases1. However, most experimental studies have focused on a few layers in two-dimensional systems. Extending twistronics to three dimensions, in which the twist extends into the third dimension, remains underexplored because of the challenges associated with the manual stacking of layers. Here we study three-dimensional twistronics using a self-assembled twisted spiral superlattice of multilayered WS2. Our findings show an opto-twistronic Hall effect driven by structural chirality and coherence length, modulated by the moir & eacute; potential of the spiral superlattice. This is an experimental manifestation of the noncommutative geometry of the system. We observe enhanced light-matter interactions and an altered dependence of the Hall coefficient on photon momentum. Our model suggests contributions from higher-order quantum geometric quantities to this observation, providing opportunities for designing quantum-materials-based optoelectronic lattices with large nonlinearities.
   Opto-twistronic Hall effect driven by structural chirality and coherence length is observed in a three-dimensional self-assembled twisted spiral superlattice of WS2.

ID SELF-ASSEMBLED MONOLAYERS; FILMS
AB The covalent interaction of N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) with transition metal atoms gives rise to distinctive frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs). These emergent electronic states have spurred the widespread adoption of NHC ligands in chemical catalysis and functional materials. Although formation of carbene-metal complexes in self-assembled monolayers on surfaces has been explored, design and electronic structure characterization of extended low-dimensional NHC-metal lattices remains elusive. Here we demonstrate a modular approach to engineering one-dimensional (1D) metal-organic chains and two-dimensional (2D) Kagome lattices using the FMOs of NHC-Au-NHC junctions to create low-dimensional molecular networks exhibiting intrinsic metallicity. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy and first-principles density functional theory reveal the contribution of C-Au-C pi-bonding states to dispersive bands that imbue 1D- and 2D-NHC lattices with exceptionally small work functions.

AB The climate-related concerns associated with the manufacturing of synthetic fertilizers are largely traced back to energy and carbon emissions during the chemical manufacturing of ammonia. However, synthetic fertilizers are made up of several macronutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium), each with different energy intensities and environmental impacts. With the movement toward resource circularity, there is a need to create a more holistic view regarding the process energy associated with synthetic inorganic fertilizers, including nitrogen and phosphorus. Here, we first describe the growing production and consumption of inorganic (synthetic) and organic (animal waste) nutrients in agriculture as well as the process energy associated with the production of granular phosphorus and nitrogen-based fertilizers. Next, we present projected global demand of nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients based on various sustainability and societal equity scenarios to make an argument for nutrient recovery as a viable approach to meet this demand. Finally, we discuss the characteristics and challenges of emerging technologies for nutrient recovery along with baseline performance and costs of current operational recovery facilities.

TI Tailoring physical properties of crystals through synthetic temperature
   control: A case study for new polymorphic NbFeTe2 phases
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
LA English
DT Article
ID LAYERED COMPOUND; INTRINSIC FERROMAGNETISM
AB Growth parameters play a significant role in the crystal quality and physical properties of layered materials. Here we present a case study on a van der Waals magnetic NbFeTe2 material. Two different types of polymorphic NbFeTe2 phases, synthesized at different temperatures, display significantly different behaviors in crystal symmetry, electronic structure, electrical transport, and magnetism. While the phase synthesized at low temperature showing behavior consistent with previous reports, the new phase synthesized at high temperature, has completely different physical properties, such as metallic resistivity, long-range ferromagnetic order, anomalous Hall effect, negative magnetoresistance, and distinct electronic structures. Neutron diffraction reveals out-of-plane ferromagnetism below 70 K, consistent with the electrical transport and magnetic susceptibility studies. Our work suggests that simply tuning synthetic parameters in a controlled manner could be an effective route to alter the physical properties of existing materials potentially unlocking new states of matter, or even discovering new materials.

AB The gait patterns of stroke survivors become slow and metabolically inefficient as a result of muscle weakness and low weight-bearing capacity. Exoskeletons and assistive robots can improve gait kinematics and energetics. However, the use of these powered devices may cause a reliance on the device itself that results in limited lasting improvement of the paretic leg function. Specifically, there exists a need to strengthen and train the response of weak ankle muscles, such as the soleus muscle, in stroke survivors. Impaired activation of the soleus muscle induces unnatural gait kinematics and reduced propulsion. The mechanical modulation of the soleus muscle can improve its loading response and enhance gait performance after a stroke. This paper develops a closed-loop feedback controller to manipulate the ankle joint dynamics to mechanically control the soleus muscle response using a motorized ankle orthosis. The control method is inspired by backstepping control techniques and developed to connect the ankle joint angular velocity and the soleus muscle response during the stance phase of walking. The tracking objective is quantified using an integral-like muscle error between the desired soleus response and the actual muscle response, which is measurable using surface electromyography (EMG). The closed-loop electric motor controller is designed to apply ankle perturbations exploiting the backstepping error and an adaptive control term to cope with uncertain parameters that satisfy the linear-in-the-parameters property. A switching signal is developed using heel and toe ground reaction forces to strategically perturb the ankle and target the soleus muscle loading response in real-time during the mid-late stance phase of walking. A Lyapunov-based stability analysis is used to guarantee a globally uniformly ultimately bounded (GUUB) tracking result.

AB Sodium ion batteries (SIB) are among the most promising devices for large scale energy storage. Their stable and long-term performance depends on the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), a nanosized, heterogeneous and disordered layer, formed due to degradation of the electrolyte at the anode surface. The chemical and structural properties of the SEI control the charge transfer process at the electrode-electrolyte interface, thus, there is great interest in determining these properties for understanding, and ultimately controlling, SEI functionality. However, the study of the SEI is notoriously challenging due to its heterogeneous nature and minute quantity. In this work, we present a powerful approach for probing the SEI based on solid state NMR spectroscopy with increased sensitivity from dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). Utilizing exogenous (organic radicals) and endogenous (paramagnetic metal ion dopants) DNP sources, we obtain not only a detailed compositional map of the SEI but also, for the first time for the native SEI, determine the spatial distribution of its constituent phases. Using this approach, we perform a thorough investigation of the SEI formed on Li4Ti5O12 used as a SIB anode. We identify a compositional gradient, from organic phases at the electrolyte interface to inorganic phases toward the anode surface. We find that the use of fluoroethylene carbonate as an electrolyte additive leads to performance degradation which can be attributed to formation of a thicker SEI, rich in NaF and carbonates. We expect that this methodology can be extended to examine other titanate anodes and new electrolyte compositions, offering a unique tool for SEI investigations to enable the development of effective and long-lasting SIBs.

AB Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a flexible, nontoxic polymer commonly used in biological and medical research, and it is generally regarded as biologically inert. PEG molecules of variable sizes are also used as crowding agents to mimic intracellular environments. A recent study with PEG crowders revealed decreased catalytic activity of Escherichia coli prolyl-tRNA synthetase (Ec ProRS), where the smaller molecular weight PEGs had the maximum impact. The molecular mechanism of the crowding effects of PEGs is not clearly understood. PEG may impact protein conformation and dynamics, thus its function. In the present study, the effects of PEG molecules of various molecular weights and concentrations on the conformation and dynamics of Ec ProRS were investigated using a combined experimental and computational approach including intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and atomistic molecular dynamic simulations. Results of the present study suggest that lower molecular weight PEGs in the dilute regime have modest effects on the conformational dynamics of Ec ProRS but impact the catalytic function primarily via the excluded volume effect; they form large clusters blocking the active site pocket. In contrast, the larger molecular weight PEGs in dilute to semidilute regimes have a significant impact on the protein's conformational dynamics; they wrap on the protein surface through noncovalent interactions. Thus, lower-molecular-weight PEG molecules impact protein dynamics and function via crowding effects, whereas larger PEGs induce confinement effects. These results have implications for the development of inhibitors for protein targets in a crowded cellular environment.

TI Sparks of Generative Pretrained Transformers in Edge Intelligence for

AB Aiming at achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI) for the metaverse, pretrained foundation models (PFMs), e.g., generative pretrained transformers (GPTs), can effectively provide various artificial intelligence (AI) services, such as autonomous driving, digital twins (DTs), and AI-generated content (AIGC) for extended reality (XR). With the advantages of low latency and privacy-preserving, serving PFMs of mobile AI services in edge intelligence is a viable solution for caching and executing PFMs on edge servers with limited computing resources and GPU memory. However, PFMs typically consist of billions of parameters that are computation- and memory-intensive for edge servers during loading and execution. In this article, we investigate edge PFM serving problems for mobile AIGC services of the metaverse. First, we introduce the fundamentals of PFMs and discuss their characteristic fine-tuning and inference methods in edge intelligence. Then, we propose a novel framework of joint model caching and inference for managing models and allocating resources to satisfy users' requests efficiently. Furthermore, considering the in-context learning ability of PFMs, we propose a new metric to evaluate the freshness and relevance between examples in demonstrations and executing tasks, namely the Age of Context (AoC). Finally, we propose a least-context (LC) algorithm for managing cached models at edge servers by balancing the tradeoff among latency, energy consumption, and accuracy.

AB Bacillus anthracis is a spore- forming gram- positive bacterium responsible for anthrax, an infectious disease with a high mortality rate and a target of concern due to bioterrorism and long- term site contamination. The entire surface of vegetative cells in exponential or stationary growth phase is covered in proteinaceous arrays called S- layers, composed of Sap or EA1 protein, respectively. The Sap S- layer represents an important virulence factor and cell envelope support structure whose paracrystalline nature is essential for its function. However, the spatial organization of Sap in its lattice state remains elusive. Here, we employed cryoelectron tomography and subtomogram averaging to obtain a map of the Sap S- layer from tubular polymers that revealed a conformational switch between the postassembly protomers and the previously available X- ray structure of the condensed monomers. To build and validate an atomic model of the lattice within this map, we used a combination of molecular dynamics simulations, X- ray crystallography, cross- linking mass spectrometry, and biophysics in an integrative structural biology approach. The Sap lattice model produced recapitulates a close- to- physiological arrangement, reveals high- resolution details of lattice contacts, and sheds light on the mechanisms underlying the stability of the Sap layer.

AB Tracking gene expression in deep tissues requires genetic reporters that can be unambiguously detected using tissue penetrant techniques. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is uniquely suited for this purpose; however, there is a dearth of reporters that can be reliably linked to gene expression with minimal interference from background tissue signals. Here, we present a conceptually new method for generating background-subtracted, drug-gated, multiplex images of gene expression using MRI. Specifically, we engineered chemically erasable reporters consisting of a water channel, aquaporin-1, fused to destabilizing domains, which are stabilized by binding to cell-permeable small-molecule ligands. We showed that this approach allows for highly specific detection of gene expression through differential imaging. In addition, by engineering destabilized aquaporin-1 variants with orthogonal ligand requirements, it is possible to distinguish distinct subpopulations of cells in mixed cultures. Finally, we demonstrated this approach in a mouse tumor model through differential imaging of gene expression with minimal background.
   Biochemically destabilized aquaporin allows for small-molecule modulation of genetically encoded MRI signals, enabling the detection of transcriptional activity in deep tissues in a background-free, drug-gated, and chemically multiplexed manner.

AB Access to synchrotron X-ray facilities has become an important aspect for many disciplines in experimental Earth science. This is especially important for studies that rely on probing samples in situ under natural conditions different from the ones found at the surface of the Earth. The non-ambient condition Earth science program at the Advanced Light Source (ALS), Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, offers a variety of tools utilizing the infra-red and hard X-ray spectrum that allow Earth scientists to probe Earth and environmental materials at variable conditions of pressure, stress, temperature, atmospheric composition, and humidity. These facilities are important tools for the user community in that they offer not only considerable capacity (non-ambient condition diffraction) but also complementary (IR spectroscopy, microtomography), and in some cases unique (Laue microdiffraction) instruments. The availability of the ALS' in situ probes to the Earth science community grows especially critical during the ongoing dark time of the Advanced Photon Source in Chicago, which massively reduces available in situ synchrotron user time in North America.

   Foundation-funded Consortium for Materials Properties Research in the
   Earth Sciences under NSF Cooperative Agreement EAR 1606856. An explicit
   goal of this enterprise was enabling Earth sciences users to access
   state-of-the-art beamlines at Department of Energy facilities. From a
   logistical standpoint, at the Advanced Light Source, this synergistic
   relationship between two administratively distinct agencies on behalf of
   the high-pressure Earth sciences community is accomplished via the ALS
   Approved Program mechanism. In most instances, this vehicle is oriented
   towards providing a guaranteed amount of beamtime each cycle for a
   single particularly active group on a timely and distinct research
   direction. In the case of COMPRES, the guarantee has been for 35% of the
   beamtime at beamline 12.2.2, but a supplementary arrangement has been
   orchestrated in which beamtime for COMPRES users is allocated via the
   ALS' General User Program, rather than by the Approved Program Principal
   Investigator, as is typical. The COMPRES initiative was replaced in late
   2023 by a new, NSF-funded community-driven organization-SEES:
   Synchrotron Earth and Environmental Science. SEES is supported by the
   National Science Foundation Division of Earth Sciences (EAR) via
   EAR-2223273. The logistics of the new organization interfacing with the
   ALS are similar to those developed during COMPRES, although the
   scientific footprint of the new organization is broader, and hence its
   footprint at the ALS will extend beyond beamline 12.2.2.

AB Substitutional heteroatom doping of bottom-up engineered 1D graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) is a versatile tool for realizing low-dimensional functional materials for nanoelectronics and sensing. Previous efforts have largely relied on replacing C-H groups lining the edges of GNRs with trigonal planar N atoms. This type of atomically precise doping, however, only results in a modest realignment of the valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) energies. Here, we report the design, bottom-up synthesis, and spectroscopic characterization of nitrogen core-doped 5-atom-wide armchair GNRs (N-2-5-AGNRs) that yield much greater energy-level shifting of the GNR electronic structure. Here, the substitution of C atoms with N atoms along the backbone of the GNR introduces a single surplus p-electron per dopant that populates the electronic states associated with previously unoccupied bands. First-principles DFT-LDA calculations confirm that a sizable shift in Fermi energy (similar to 1.0 eV) is accompanied by a broad reconfiguration of the band structure, including the opening of a new band gap and the transition from a direct to an indirect semiconducting band gap. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) lift-off charge transport experiments corroborate the theoretical results and reveal the relationship among substitutional heteroatom doping, Fermi-level shifting, electronic band structure, and topological engineering for this new N-doped GNR.

AB Metallic graphenenanoribbons (GNRs) represent a critical componentin the toolbox of low-dimensional functional materials technologyserving as 1D interconnects capable of both electronic and quantuminformation transport. The structural constraints imposed by on-surfacebottom-up GNR synthesis protocols along with the limited control overorientation and sequence of asymmetric monomer building blocks duringthe radical step-growth polymerization have plagued the design andassembly of metallic GNRs. Here, we report the regioregular synthesisof GNRs hosting robust metallic states by embedding a symmetric zero-mode(ZM) superlattice along the backbone of a GNR. Tight-binding electronicstructure models predict a strong nearest-neighbor electron hoppinginteraction between adjacent ZM states, resulting in a dispersivemetallic band. First-principles density functional theory-local densityapproximation calculations confirm this prediction, and the robust,metallic ZM band of olympicene GNRs is experimentally corroboratedby scanning tunneling spectroscopy.

AB We propose a first-principles model of minimum lattice thermal conductivity (rmin L ) based on a unified theoretical treatment of thermal transport in crystals and glasses. We apply this model to thousands of inorganic compounds and find a universal behavior of rmin L in crystals in the high-temperature limit: The isotropically averaged rmin L is independent of structural complexity and bounded within a range from & SIM;0.1 to & SIM;2.6 W/(m K), in striking contrast to the conventional phonon gas model which predicts no lower bound. We unveil the underlying physics by showing that for a given parent compound, rmin L is bounded from below by a value that is approximately insensitive to disorder, but the relative importance of different heat transport channels (phonon gas versus diffuson) depends strongly on the degree of disorder. Moreover, we propose that the diffuson-dominated rmin L in complex and disordered compounds might be effectively approximated by the phonon gas model for an ordered compound by averaging out disorder and applying phonon unfolding. With these insights, we further bridge the knowledge gap between our model and the well-known Cahill- Watson-Pohl (CWP) model, rationalizing the successes and limitations of the CWP model in the absence of heat transfer mediated by diffusons. Finally, we construct graph network and random forest machine learning models to extend our predictions to all compounds within the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD), which were validated against thermoelectric materials possessing experimentally measured ultralow rL. Our work offers a unified understanding of rLmin, which can guide the rational engineering of materials to achieve rmin L .

AB Dislocations in van der Waals (vdW) layered nanomaterials induce strain and structural changes that substantially impact thermal transport. Understanding these effects could enable the manipulation of dislocations for improved thermoelectric and optoelectronic applications, but experimental insights remain limited. In this study, we use synthetic Eshelby twisted vdW GeS nanowires (NWs) with single screw dislocations as a model system to explore the interplay between dislocation-induced structural modifications and lattice thermal conductivity. Our measurements reveal a monoclinic structure stabilized by the dislocation, leading to a substantial drop in thermal conductivity for larger-diameter NWs (70% at room temperature), supported by first-principles calculations. Interestingly, we also find an anomalous enhancement of thermal conductivity with decreasing diameter in twisted NWs, contrary to typical trends in non-twisted GeS NWs. This is attributed to increased conductivity near the NW cores due to compressive strain around the central dislocations, and aligns with a density-functional-theory-informed core-shell model. Our results highlight the critical role of dislocations in thermal conduction, providing fundamental insights for defect and strain engineering in advanced thermal applications.

AB Integrating experiment and simulation provides invaluable insights into the critical parameters that determine the microstructure of alloys produced by additive manufacturing. Here, the grain structure formation due to solidification during single pass laser scans (mimicking bead-on-plate single tracks) on a 316L stainless steel is studied in situ inside a scanning electron microscope that is directly integrated with a continuous-wave laser. The grain size distribution before melting is used as an initial condition in a coupled phase-field/thermal multiphysics modeling framework. The predicted resolidified microstructures are found to agree favorably with those observed experimentally for multiple laser powers and scan velocities, indicating the validity of the overall model. Grain morphology is analyzed quantitatively, and the top surfaces are compared between the experiments and simulations. Analysis of the three-dimensional grain shapes predicted by the simulations shows that the length of the major axis of the resolidified grains is sensitive to laser power and scan speeds, while the length of the minor axis is not. Furthermore, the preferential alignment of the major axes of the grains depends on the melt pool geometry.

AB The creation of metal-metal oxide interfaces is an important approach to fine-tuning catalyst properties through strong interfacial interactions. This article presents the work on developing interfaces between Pt and CeOx that improve Pt surface energetics for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) within an alkaline electrolyte. The Pt-CeOx interfaces are formed by depositing size-controlled Pt nanoparticles onto a carbon support already coated with ultrathin CeOx nanosheets. This interface structure facilitates substantial electron transfer from Pt to CeOx, resulting in decreased hydrogen binding energies on Pt surfaces, and water dissociation for the HER, as predicted by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Electrochemical testing indicates that both Pt specific activity and mass activity are improved by a factor of 2 to 3 following the formation of Pt-CeOx interfaces. This study underscores the significance and potential of harnessing robust interfacial effects to enhance electrocatalytic reactions.

ID FEEDBACK
AB Stroke survivors experience muscle weakness and low weight-bearing capacity that impair their walking. The activation of the plantarflexor muscles is diminished following a stroke, which degrades propulsion and balance. Powered exoskeletons can improve gait capacity and restore impaired muscle activity. However, a technical barrier exists to generate systematic control methods to predictably and safely perturb the paretic leg using a wearable device to characterize the plantarflexors' muscle output for gait training. In this paper, a closed-loop robust controller is designed to impose an ankle joint rotation (i.e., a kinematic perturbation) in the mid-late stance phase to target the soleus muscle using a powered cable-driven ankle-foot orthosis. The goal is to generate soleus muscle activity increments throughout a gait experiment by applying ankle perturbations. This ability to modulate plan-tarflexor activity can be used in future conditioning studies to improve push-off and propulsion during walking. However, the optimal perturbation magnitude for each participant is unknown. Hence, online adaptation of the ankle perturbation is well-motivated to modulate the soleus response measured using surface electromyography (EMG). An extremum seeking controller (ESC) is implemented in real-time to compute the ankle perturbation magnitude (i.e., dorsiflexion angle) exploiting the soleus EMG response from the previous perturbed step to maximize the soleus response in the next perturbed step. A Lyapunov-based stability analysis is used to guarantee exponential kinematic tracking of the ankle perturbation objective.

AB In the vehicular mixed reality (MR) Metaverse, the discrepancy between physical and virtual entities can be overcome by fusing the physical and virtual environments with multi-dimensional communications in autonomous driving systems. Assisted by digital twin (DT) technologies, connected autonomous vehicles (AVs), roadside units (RSUs), and virtual simulators can maintain the vehicular MR Metaverse via simulations for sharing data and making driving decisions collaboratively. However, it is challenging and costly to enable large-scale traffic and driving simulation via realistic data collection and fusion from the physical world for online prediction and offline training in autonomous driving systems. In this paper, we propose an autonomous driving architecture, where generative AI is leveraged to synthesize unlimited conditioned traffic and driving data via simulations for improving driving safety and traffic control efficiency. First, we propose a multi-task DT offloading model for the reliable execution of heterogeneous DT tasks with different requirements at RSUs. Then, based on the preferences of AV's DTs and real-world data, virtual simulators can synthesize unlimited conditioned driving and traffic datasets for improved robustness. Finally, we propose a multi-task enhanced auction-based mechanism to provide fine-grained incentives for RSUs on providing resources for autonomous driving. The property analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism and architecture are strategy-proof and effective.

AB As research on integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) progresses, it has been discovered that ISAC can be effectively utilized to enhance the security of wireless communications. Its sensing function can assist in both eavesdropping detection and physical-layer security techniques. In this article, our focus lies on addressing the security challenges associated with high-speed train-to-ground communication using ISAC technology. We explore a novel secure communication scheme. Specifically, we exploit the sensing capabilities of ISAC to detect eavesdropping at the receiving end and subsequently establish a signal blind zone at the location where eavesdropping occurs through beamforming and waveform optimization techniques. This approach ensures the achievement of secure wireless communication. Mathematically modeling the problem as an optimization problem, we derive a lower bound for simplification purposes. Subsequently, we employ an alternating optimization algorithm to iteratively find suboptimal solutions for the optimization variables. Through extensive simulation experiments and comparative analysis, we demonstrate that our proposed algorithm not only guarantees communication security but also outperforms existing algorithms in terms of efficiency.

AB Unlike naturally derived peptides, computationally designed sequences offer programmed self-assembly and charge display. Herein, new tetrameric, coiled coil-forming peptides were computationally designed ranging from 8 to 29 amino acids in length. Experimental investigations revealed that only the sequences having three or more heptads (i.e., 21 or more amino acids) exhibited coiled coil behavior. The shortest stable coiled coil sequence had a melting temperature (T-m) of approximately 58 +/- 1 degrees C, making it ideal for thermoreversible assembly over moderate temperatures. Effects of pH and monovalent salt were examined, revealing structural stability over a pH range of 4 to 11 and an enhancement in T-m with the addition of salt. The incorporation of the coiled coil as a hydrogel cross-linker results in a thermally and mechanically reversible hydrogel. A subsequent demonstration of the hydrogel printed through a syringe illustrated one of many potential uses from 3D printing to injectable hydrogel drug delivery.

AB Intermetallics with crystals derived from body -centered cubic structures are promising materials to enhance the performance and high temperature capability of high -strength alloys both as matrix materials and as strengthening precipitates. Given the ordered nature of these materials, the defect structures that ultimately mediate plasticity can be complex and strongly dependent on processing vis-a-vis the extent of disorder inherited from high temperature phases. Here, we elucidate the elementary characteristics of the defect structures in the Heusler (L21) intermetallic MnCu2Al as investigated by the orientation -dependent strength and compressive plasticity measured from in situ micro -compression experiments and post-mortem transmission electron microscopy. Our experiments reveal single crystal compressive yield strengths as high as 1.2 GPa and a capacity for stable plastic deformation, accompanied by slip characteristics reminiscent of bcc-derived crystals. We study the equilibrium dissociation mechanisms and critical stresses of ⟨111⟩{110}-type dislocations in the Heusler intermetallic using an ab initio informed phase field dislocation dynamics model. The calculations suggest that the dislocation dissociates into multiple distinct partials, which depend on the character of the dislocation, and are closely spaced to a degree that intervening faults are undetectable using conventional transmission electron microscopy. Critical stresses to initiate glide of these defect structures quantitatively agree with measured yield strengths. Our work details the interplay between the significant degree of elastic anisotropy, stacking fault energies, and glissile defect structures governing mechanical properties and motivates an increased awareness of the role that complex defect structures play for alloy design involving bcc-derived intermetallics.

AB Understanding nonequilibrium interactions of multi-component colloidal suspensions is critical for many dynamical settings such as self-assembly and material processing. A key question is how the nonequilibrium distributions of individual components influence the effective interparticle interactions and flow behavior. In this work, we develop a first-principle framework to study a bidisperse suspension of colloids and depletants using a Smoluchowski equation and corroborated by Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations. Using nonlinear microrheology as a case study, we demonstrate that effective depletion interactions between driven colloids are sensitive to particle timescales out of equilibrium and cannot be predicted by equilibrium-based pair potentials like Asakura-Oosawa. Furthermore, we show that the interplay between Brownian relaxation timescales of different species plays a critical role in governing the viscosity of multi-component suspensions. Our model highlights the limitations of using equilibrium pair potentials to approximate interparticle interactions in nonequilibrium processes such as hydrodynamic flows and presents a useful framework for studying the transport of driven, interacting suspensions.
   Using nonlinear microrheology as a case study, we elucidate a mechanism for how depletant timescales modulate nonequilibrium depletion interactions between colloids in out-of-equilibrium suspensions.

AB For the first time, the (d, 2He) reaction was successfully used in inverse kinematics to extract the Gamow-Teller transition strength in the & beta; thorn direction from an unstable nucleus. The new technique was made possible by the use of an active-target time-projection chamber and a magnetic spectrometer, and opens a path to addressing a range of scientific challenges, including in astrophysics and neutrino physics. In this Letter, the nucleus studied was 14O, and the Gamow-Teller transition strength to 14N was extracted up to an excitation energy of 22 MeV. The data were compared to shell-model and state-of-the-art coupled -cluster calculations. Shell-model calculations reproduce the measured Gamow-Teller strength distribution up to about 15 MeV reasonably well, after the application of a phenomenological quenching factor. In a significant step forward to better understand this quenching, the coupled-cluster calculation reproduces the full strength distribution well without such quenching, owing to the large model space, the inclusion of strong correlations, and the coupling of the weak interaction to two nucleons through two-body currents.

AB Solid-state devices made from correlated oxides, such as perovskite nickelates, are promising for neuromorphic computing by mimicking biological synaptic function. However, comprehending dopant action at the nanoscale poses a formidable challenge to understanding the elementary mechanisms involved. Here, we perform operando infrared nanoimaging of hydrogen-doped correlated perovskite, neodymium nickel oxide (H-NdNiO3, H-NNO), devices and reveal how an applied field perturbs dopant distribution at the nanoscale. This perturbation leads to stripe phases of varying conductivity perpendicular to the applied field, which define the macroscale electrical characteristics of the devices. Hyperspectral nano-FTIR imaging in conjunction with density functional theory calculations unveils a real-space map of multiple vibrational states of H-NNO associated with OH stretching modes and their dependence on the dopant concentration. Moreover, the localization of excess charges induces an out-of-plane lattice expansion in NNO which was confirmed by in situ X-ray diffraction and creates a strain that acts as a barrier against further diffusion. Our results and the techniques presented here hold great potential for the rapidly growing field of memristors and neuromorphic devices wherein nanoscale ion motion is fundamentally responsible for function.

AB Climate change has adversely affected maize productivity. Thereby, a holistic understanding of metabolic crosstalk among its organs is important to address this issue. Thus, we reconstructed the first multi-organ maize metabolic model, iZMA6517, and contextualized it with heat and cold stress transcriptomics data using expression distributed reaction flux measurement (EXTREAM) algorithm. Furthermore, implementing metabolic bottleneck analysis on contextualized models revealed differences between these stresses. While both stresses had reducing power bottlenecks, heat stress had additional energy generation bottlenecks. We also performed thermodynamic driving force analysis, revealing thermodynamics-reducing power-energy generation axis dictating the nature of temperature stress responses. Thus, a temperature-tolerant maize ideotype can be engineered by leveraging the proposed thermodynamics-reducing power-energy generation axis. We experimentally inoculated maize root with a beneficial mycorrhizal fungus, Rhi-zophagus irregularis, and as a proof-of-concept demonstrated its efficacy in alleviating temperature stress. Overall, this study will guide the engineering effort of temperature stress-tolerant maize ideotypes.

TI Ligand-Mediated Quantum Yield Enhancement in 1-D Silver Organothiolate
   Metal-Organic Chalcogenolates

ID COORDINATION POLYMERS; COMPLEXES; ANNIHILATION; EMISSION; SINGLE; WS2
AB X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) microcrystallography and synchrotron single-crystal crystallography are used to evaluate the role of organic substituent position on the optoelectronic properties of metal-organic chalcogenolates (MOChas). MOChas are crystalline 1D and 2D semiconducting hybrid materials that have varying optoelectronic properties depending on composition, topology, and structure. While MOChas have attracted much interest, small crystal sizes impede routine crystal structure determination. A series of constitutional isomers where the aryl thiol is functionalized by either methoxy or methyl ester are solved by small molecule serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography (smSFX) and single crystal rotational crystallography. While all the methoxy examples have a low quantum yield (0-1%), the methyl ester in the ortho position yields a high quantum yield of 22%. The proximity of the oxygen atoms to the silver inorganic core correlates to a considerable enhancement of quantum yield. Four crystal structures are solved at a resolution range of 0.8-1.0 & Aring; revealing a collapse of the 2D topology for functional groups in the 2- and 3- positions, resulting in needle-like crystals. Further analysis using density functional theory (DFT) and many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) enables the exploration of complex excitonic phenomena within easily prepared material systems.

AB Various noise models have been developed in quantum computing study to describe the propagation and effect of the noise that is caused by imperfect implementation of hardware. Identifying parameters such as gate and readout error rates is critical to these models. We use a Bayesian inference approach to identify posterior distributions of these parameters such that they can be characterized more elaborately. By characterizing the device errors in this way, we can further improve the accuracy of quantum error mitigation. Experiments conducted on IBM's quantum computing devices suggest that our approach provides better error mitigation performance than existing techniques used by the vendor. Also, our approach outperforms the standard Bayesian inference method in some scenarios.

AB Thioesters are an essential functional group in biosynthetic pathways, which has motivated their development as reactive handles in probes and peptide assembly. Thioester exchange is typically accelerated by catalysts or elevated pH. Here, we report the use of bifunctional aromatic thioesters as dynamic covalent cross-links in hydrogels, demonstrating that at physiologic pH in aqueous conditions, transthioesterification facilitates stress relaxation on the time scale of hundreds of seconds. We show that intramolecular hydrogen bonding is responsible for accelerated exchange, evident in both molecular kinetics and macromolecular stress relaxation. Drawing from concepts in the vitrimer literature, this system exemplifies how dynamic cross-links that exchange through an associative mechanism enable tunable stress relaxation without altering stiffness.

AB The contributed papers in this special issue each provide valuable perspectives on how social processes are relevant to academic motivation. Yet a critical question remains: How can this research lead to concrete guidance for educators who wish to create motivating and equitable classrooms? We propose this complex task can be simplified by encouraging educators to address students' concerns about how they are viewed by instructors in school. Our review of the literature suggests that two meta-concerns are particularly important to address for students from groups marginalized in education: whether instructors may (1) see them as limited in academic potential and (2) narrowly define them by their academic success. We argue that effective teaching practices address these concerns by communicating two corresponding messages: (1) inclusive expectations, "I recognize your potential for academic growth" and (2) broad regard, "I regard you as a whole person, with a range of personal values, social identities, and relationships." These messages can shift students away from a "narrow" sense of self, in which their value is defined by current academic performance, and towards an "expansive" sense of self, in which students feel both academically capable and valued for more than just their academic success. We present evidence that novice instructors can use this framework to develop or adapt practices that are attuned to marginalized students' two meta-concerns and enhance student motivation and engagement. Throughout this commentary, we describe how this framework can build on the important theoretical advances presented elsewhere in this special issue.

AB New energy storage methods are emerging to increase the energy density of state-of-the-art battery systems beyond conventional intercalation electrode materials. For instance, employing anion redox can yield higher capacities compared with transition metal redox alone. Anion redox in sulfides has been recognized since the early days of rechargeable battery research. Here, we study the effect of d-p overlap in controlling anion redox by shifting the metal d band position relative to the S p band. We aim to determine the effect of shifting the d band position on the electronic structure and, ultimately, on charge compensation. Two isostructural sulfides LiNaFeS2 and LiNaCoS2 are directly compared to the hypothesis that the Co material should yield more covalent metal-anion bonds. LiNaCoS2 exhibits a multielectron capacity of >= 1.7 electrons per formula unit, but despite the lowered Co d band, the voltage of anion redox is close to that of LiNaFeS2. Interestingly, the material suffers from rapid capacity fade. Through a combination of solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, Co and S X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and partial density of states calculations, we demonstrate that oxidation of S nonbonding p states to S-2(2-) occurs in early states of charge, which leads to an irreversible phase transition. We conclude that the lower energy of Co d bands increases their overlap with S p bands while maintaining S nonbonding p states at the same higher energy level, thus causing no alteration in the oxidation potential. Further, the higher crystal field stabilization energy for octahedral coordination over tetrahedral coordination is proposed to cause the irreversible phase transition in LiNaCoS2.

AB Viral infections are major modulators of marine microbial community assembly and biogeochemical cycling. In coral reefs, viral lysis controls bacterial overgrowth that is detrimental to coral health. However, methodological limitations have prevented the identification of viral hosts and quantification of their interaction frequencies. Here, we reconstructed an abundance-resolved virus-bacteria interaction network in the oligotrophic coral reef waters of Cura & ccedil;ao by integrating direct microscopy counts with virus-host links obtained from proximity-ligation, prophage integration, and CRISPR spacers. This network of 3013 individual links (97 unique species-level interactions) revealed that the abundance of free viral particles was weakly related to host abundance and viral production, as indicated by the cell-associated virus-to-host ratio (VHR). The viruses with the highest free and cell-associated VHR, interpreted here as highly productive viruses, formed links with intermediate-to-low abundance hosts belonging to Gammaproteobacteria, Bacteroidia, and Planctomycetia. In contrast, low-production viruses interacted with abundant members of Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria enriched in prophages. These findings highlight the decoupling between viral abundance and production and identify potentially active viruses. We propose that differential decay rates and burst sizes may explain the decoupling between free viral abundance and production and that lysogenic infections play an important role in the ecology of high-abundance hosts.

AB The exotic polarization configurations of topologically protected dipolar textures have opened new avenues for realizing novel phenomena absent in traditional ferroelectric systems. While multiple recent studies have revealed a diverse array of emergent properties in such polar topologies, the details of their atomic and mesoscale structures remain incomplete. Through atomic- and meso-scale imaging techniques, the emergence of a macroscopic ferroelectric polarization along both principal axes of the vortex lattice while performing phase-field modeling to probe the atomic scale origins of these distinct polarization components is demonstrated. Additionally, due to the anisotropic epitaxial strain, the polarization switching behavior perpendicular and parallel to the vortices is highly anisotropic, with switching along the vortex axes occurring over numerous decades in field-pulse width. This slow switching process allows for the deterministic control of the polarization state, enabling a non-volatile, multi-state memory with excellent distinguishability and long retention times.

AB The lack of high-performance cathode catalysts is a salient issue that bedeviled the commercialization of protonic ceramic fuel cells (PCFCs). Here, we report a remarkable electrocatalytic activity and stability enhancement of cathode electrodes by engineering a coupled nanocomposite. The as-prepared Pr0.3(Ba0.5Sr0.5)0.7Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta nanocomposite possesses a bulk cubic phase on which homogeneous and intimate orthorhombic PrCo0.5Fe0.5O3-delta nanoparticles are uniformly decorated. X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy reveal the excellent thermal stability of the nanocomposite. It achieves a high peak power density of 1.02 W cm-2 based on protonic electrolytes at 600 degrees C. No noticeable structural degradation is observed over similar to 210 h at 550 degrees C according to scanning electron microscopy analysis. This work demonstrates an effective strategy to boost the performance of perovskite oxides for PCFCs via nanocomposite engineering. It may apply to other catalyst designs and discoveries, such as for batteries, electrolyzers, and membrane reactors.

AB We combine synchrotron -based infrared absorption and Raman scattering spectroscopies with diamond anvil cell techniques and first -principles calculations to explore the properties of hafnia under compression. We find that pressure drives HfO2:7%Y from the mixed monoclinic (P21/c) + antipolar orthorhombic (Pbca) phase to pure antipolar orthorhombic (Pbca) phase at approximately 6.3 GPa. This transformation is irreversible, meaning that upon release, the material is kinetically trapped in the Pbca metastable state at 300 K. Compression also drives polar orthorhombic (Pca21) hafnia into the tetragonal (P42/nmc) phase, although the latter is not metastable upon release. These results are unified by an analysis of the energy landscape. The fact that pressure allows us to stabilize targeted metastable structures with less Y stabilizer is important to preserving the flat phonon band physics of pure HfO2.

AB We present a discontinuous Galerkin-finite difference hybrid scheme that allows high-order shock capturing with the discontinuous Galerkin method for general relativistic magneto- hydrodynamics in dynamical spacetimes. We present several optimizations and stability improvements to our algorithm that allow the hybrid method to successfully simulate single, rotating, and binary neutron stars. The hybrid method achieves the efficiency of discontinuous Galerkin methods throughout almost the entire spacetime during the inspiral phase, while being able to robustly capture shocks and resolve the stellar surfaces. We also use Cauchy- characteristic evolution to compute the first gravitational waveforms at future null infinity from binary neutron star mergers. The simulations presented here are the first successful binary neutron star inspiral and merger simulations using discontinuous Galerkin methods.

AB Bacterial mRNA sequencing is inefficientinefficient due to the abundance of ribosomal RNA that is challenging to deplete. While commercial kits target rRNA from common bacterial species, they are frequently inefficientinefficient when applied to divergent species, including those from environmental isolates. Similarly, other methods typically employ large probe sets that tile the entire length of rRNAs; however, such approaches are infeasible when applied to many species. Therefore, we present EMBR-seq+, which requires fewer than 10 oligonucleotides per rRNA by combining rRNA blocking primers with RNase H-mediated depletion to achieve rRNA removal efficiencies of up to 99% in diverse bacterial species. Furthermore, in more complex microbial co-cultures between Fibrobacter succinogenes strain UWB7 and anaerobic fungi, EMBR-seq+ depleted both bacterial and fungal rRNA, with a fourfold improvement in bacterial rRNA depletion compared with a commercial kit, thereby demonstrating that the method can be applied to non-model microbial mixtures. Notably, for microbes with unknown rRNA sequences, EMBR-seq+ enables rapid iterations in probe design without requiring to start experiments from total RNA. Finally, efficientefficient depletion of rRNA enabled systematic quantificationquantification of the reprogramming of the bacterial transcriptome when cultured in the presence of the anaerobic fungi Anaeromyces robustus or Caecomyces churrovis. We observed that F. succinogenes strain UWB7 downregulated several lignocellulose-degrading carbohydrate-active enzymes in the presence of anaerobic gut fungi, suggesting close interactions between two cellulolytic species that specialize in differentdifferent aspects of biomass breakdown. Thus, EMBR-seq+ enables efficient,efficient, cost-effective,cost-effective, and rapid quantificationquantification of the transcriptome to gain insights into non-model microbial systems.

AB Topological phases in laterally confined low-dimensional nanographenes have emerged as versatile design tools that can imbue otherwise unremarkable materials with exotic band structures ranging from topological semiconductors and quantum dots to intrinsically metallic bands. The periodic boundary conditions that define the topology of a given lattice have thus far prevented the translation of this technology to the quasi-zero-dimensional (0D) domain of small molecular structures. Here, we describe the synthesis of a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) featuring two localized zero modes (ZMs) formed by the topological junction interface between a trivial and nontrivial phase within a single molecule. First-principles density functional theory calculations predict a strong hybridization between adjacent ZMs that gives rise to an exceptionally small HOMO-LUMO gap. Scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy corroborate the molecular structure of 9/7/9-double quantum dots and reveal an experimental quasiparticle gap of 0.16 eV, corresponding to a carbon-based small molecule long-wavelength infrared (LWIR) absorber.

AB With the rapid development of maritime activities, efficient and reliable maritime communications have attracted ever-increasing attention, and mounting reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), called UAV-RIS, can provide flexible and adaptable services for maritime communications. In this paper, we investigate a UAV-RIS-assisted maritime communication system under a malicious jammer, where a UAV-RIS is deployed to jointly adjust its placement and RIS surface elements to maximize the system energy efficiency (EE) and guarantee quality of service requirements against jamming attacks. In addition, an adaptive energy harvesting scheme is developed for information transmission (IT) and energy harvesting (EH) simultaneously to enhance the endurance of the UAV by deploying different IT times for each RIS element. Considering the non-convex optimization problem and highly complex maritime environments, an intelligent resource management approach based on deep reinforcement learning is proposed to jointly optimize the base station's transmit power, placement of UAV-RIS, and RISs reflecting beamforming. Furthermore, hindsight experience replay is adopted to improve the learning efficiency and performance. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves the better EE and EH performances under different real-world settings compared with existing popular approaches.

TI Constraints on the location of the liquid-liquid critical point in water

AB The fascinating hypothesis that supercooled water may segregate into two distinct liquid phases, each with unique structures and densities, was first posited in 1992. This idea, initially based on numerical analyses with the ST2 water-like empirical potential, challenged the conventional understanding of water's phase behaviour at the time and has since intrigued the scientific community. Over the past three decades, advancements in computational modelling-particularly through the advent of data-driven many-body potentials rigorously derived from first principles and augmented by the efficiency of neural networks-have greatly enhanced the accuracy of molecular simulations, enabling the exploration of the phase behaviour of water with unprecedented realism. Our study leverages these computational advances to probe the elusive liquid-liquid transition in supercooled water. Microsecond-long simulations with chemical accuracy, conducted over several years, provide compelling evidence that water indeed exists in two discernibly distinct liquid states at low temperature and high pressure. By pinpointing a realistic estimate for the location of the liquid-liquid critical point at similar to 198 K and similar to 1,250 atm, our study not only advances the current understanding of water's anomalous behaviour but also establishes a basis for experimental validation. Importantly, our simulations indicate that the liquid-liquid critical point falls within temperature and pressure ranges that could potentially be experimentally probed in water nanodroplets, opening up the possibility for direct measurements.

AB Risk stratification of kidney cancers based on survival at diagnosis could enable more informed treatment decisions toward improved patient survival. Given the limited prognostic ability of clinical evaluation in segregating long-term vs short-term survivors, we sought to develop prognostic models which could exploit diagnostic CT scans for overall survival prediction in kidney cancers. This requires overcoming challenges related to model interpretability (such that the model best utilizes the most relevant locations within or around the kidney) as well as model generalizability (to ensure optimal model performance despite limited cohort sizes). In this work, we present the Spatial Attention Wavelon Network (SpAWN), which leverages a novel pre-training spatial attention operation to guide localization of convolutional responses together with wavelon activation functions to overcome known issues with vanishing/exploding gradients that occur in limited cohorts with class imbalance. SpAWN was evaluated for prognosticating survival on two large-scale publicly available cohorts of over 400 CT scans from kidney cancer patients, with comprehensive ablation studies to confirm the utility of attention maps as well as wavelon activation functions. A kidney exterior focused SpAWN model (with wavelon activations) demonstrated the best overall validation performance in segregating low- and high-risk patients in a hold-out cohort of N=223 CT scans (c-index=0.58, p=0.03), and was significantly improved compared to any alternative strategy. Integrating spatial attention with wavelon activations represents a novel interpretable and robust approach for prognosticating overall survival in kidney cancers via CT scans.

ID ACCEPTOR STENHOUSE ADDUCT; LIGHT
AB Donor-acceptor Stenhouse adducts (DASAs) are an exciting class of photoswitches due to their facile tunability, visible light absorbance, and negative photochromism. While they have shown use in a variety of applications, to date all reported DASA derivatives have low equilibrium and/or poor photoswitching in polar protic solvents, which is vital for moving towards applications in biological systems. We demonstrate a strategy to introduce a substitution on the DASA triene that results in derivatives that are stable and have high dark equilibrium of the open form in polar protic solvents. Decreasing the charge separation of these new derivatives also allows for reversible switching in polar and protic solvents including THF : water mixtures.

AB DNA repair proteins can be recruited by their histone reader domains to specific epigenomic features, with consequences on intragenomic mutation rate variation. Here, we investigated H3K4me1-associated hypomutation in plants. We first examined 2 proteins which, in plants, contain Tudor histone reader domains: PRECOCIOUS DISSOCIATION OF SISTERS 5 (PDS5C), involved in homology-directed repair, and MUTS HOMOLOG 6 (MSH6), a mismatch repair protein. The MSH6 Tudor domain of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) binds to H3K4me1 as previously demonstrated for PDS5C, which localizes to H3K4me1-rich gene bodies and essential genes. Mutations revealed by ultradeep sequencing of wild-type and msh6 knockout lines in Arabidopsis show that functional MSH6 is critical for the reduced rate of single-base substitution (SBS) mutations in gene bodies and H3K4me1-rich regions. We explored the breadth of these mechanisms among plants by examining a large rice (Oryza sativa) mutation data set. H3K4me1-associated hypomutation is conserved in rice as are the H3K4me1-binding residues of MSH6 and PDS5C Tudor domains. Recruitment of DNA repair proteins by H3K4me1 in plants reveals convergent, but distinct, epigenome-recruited DNA repair mechanisms from those well described in humans. The emergent model of H3K4me1-recruited repair in plants is consistent with evolutionary theory regarding mutation modifier systems and offers mechanistic insight into intragenomic mutation rate variation in plants.
   DNA repair proteins preferentially repair regions with the epigenomic feature H3K4me1, resulting in mutation rate heterogeneity in plants.

AB Alternative splicing is a prevalent gene-regulatory mechanism, with over 95% of multi-exon human genes estimated to be alternatively spliced. Here, we describe a tissue-specific, developmentally regulated, highly conserved, and disease-associated alternative splicing event in exon 7 of the eyes absent homolog 3 (Eya3) gene. We discovered that EYA3 expression is vital to the proliferation and differentiation of myoblasts. Genome-wide transcriptomic analysis and mass spectrometry-based proteomic studies identified SIX homeobox 4 (SIX4) and zinc finger and BTB-domain containing 1 (ZBTB1), as major transcription factors that interact with EYA3 to dictate gene expression. EYA3 isoforms differentially regulate transcription, indicating that splicing aids in temporal control of gene expression during muscle cell differentiation. Finally, we identified RNA-binding fox-1 homolog 2 (RBFOX2) as the main regulator of EYA3 splicing. Together, our findings illustrate the interplay between alternative splicing and transcription during myogenesis.

TI BayesTME: An end-to-end method for multiscale spatial transcriptional
   profiling of the tissue microenvironment
SO CELL SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
ID TUMOR; EXPRESSION; ESTIMATOR
AB Spatial variation in cellular phenotypes underlies heterogeneity in immune recognition and response to ther-apy in cancer and many other diseases. Spatial transcriptomics holds the potential to quantify such variation, but existing analysis methods are limited by their focus on individual tasks such as spot deconvolution. We present BayesTME, an end-to-end Bayesian method for analyzing spatial transcriptomics data. BayesTME unifies several previously distinct analysis goals under a single, holistic generative model. This unified approach enables BayesTME to deconvolve spots into cell phenotypes without any need for paired sin-gle-cell RNA-seq. BayesTME then goes beyond spot deconvolution to uncover spatial expression patterns among coordinated subsets of genes within phenotypes, which we term spatial transcriptional programs. BayesTME achieves state-of-the-art performance across myriad benchmarks. On human and zebrafish mel-anoma tissues, BayesTME identifies spatial transcriptional programs that capture fundamental biological phenomena such as bilateral symmetry and tumor-associated fibroblast and macrophage reprogramming. BayesTME is open source.

TI Probing helium reionization with kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich tomography
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D

DT Article
ID QUASAR LUMINOSITY FUNCTION; LYMAN-ALPHA FOREST; INTERGALACTIC MEDIUM;
   ABSORPTION
AB Reionization of helium is expected to occur at redshifts z -3 and have important consequences for quasar populations, galaxy formation, and the morphology of the intergalactic medium, but there is little known empirically about the process. Here we show that kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich tomography, based on the combination of cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements and galaxy surveys, can be used to infer the primordial helium abundance as well as the time and duration of helium reionization. We find a high-significance detection at-10 sigma can be expected from Vera Rubin Observatory and CMB-S4 in the near future. A more robust characterization of helium reionization will require next-generation experiments like MegaMapper (a proposed successor to the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument) and CMB-HD.

AB In a strongly magnetized, magnetically dominated relativistic plasma, Alfvenic turbulence can extend to scales much smaller than the particle inertial scales. It leads to an energy cascade somewhat analogous to inertial- or kinetic-Alfven turbulent cascades existing in nonrelativistic space and astrophysical plasmas. Based on phenomenological modeling and particle-in-cell numerical simulations, we propose that the energy spectrum of such relativistic kinetic-scale Alfvenic turbulence is close to k -3 or slightly steeper than that due to intermittency corrections or Landau damping. We note the analogy of this spectrum with the Kraichnan spectrum corresponding to the enstrophy cascade in 2D incompressible fluid turbulence. Such turbulence strongly energizes particles in the direction parallel to the background magnetic field, leading to nearly one-dimensional particle momentum distributions. We find that these distributions have universal log-normal statistics.

AB Chemical short-range order (SRO) is known to alter a wide array of alloy properties. Here, we investigate the SRO of binary and ternary alloys in the Cr-Mo-W system using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, coupled with Monte Carlo simulations and two distinct approaches: the real-space cluster expansion (CE) and a machine learned interatomic potential (MLIP) based on the moment tensor potential (MTP) form. The size-mismatched binary, Cr-W, exhibits phase-separating long-range order (LRO) in the phase diagram, but surprisingly, the SRO is predicted to be ordering-type from both CE and MTP. We rationalize this apparent discrepancy by accounting for the large coherency strain present in this system, which significantly suppresses the coherent phase-separating tendency relative to the incoherent phase diagram. This competition between LRO and SRO persists in the ternary Cr-Mo-W system, where we find that SRO tendencies can qualitatively differ from those in the corresponding binary alloy. The real-space CE can efficiently capture the correct nearest neighbor SRO tendencies in this system, despite failing to account for long-range strain effects, provided it is trained on the energies of sufficiently large structures to capture short-range strain contributions over the nearest neighbor ranges; however, we suggest MTP, or more generally MLIP, may provide a more general approach for comprehensive studies in disordered alloy systems, especially in medium- and high-entropy alloys exhibiting large lattice mismatch.

AB Spatially resolved gene expression profiling provides insight into tissue organization and cell-cell crosstalk; however, sequencing-based spatial transcriptomics (ST) lacks single-cell resolution. Current ST analysis methods require single-cell RNA sequencing data as a reference for rigorous interpretation of cell states, mostly do not use associated histology images and are not capable of inferring shared neighborhoods across multiple tissues. Here we present Starfysh, a computational toolbox using a deep generative model that incorporates archetypal analysis and any known cell type markers to characterize known or new tissue-specific cell states without a single-cell reference. Starfysh improves the characterization of spatial dynamics in complex tissues using histology images and enables the comparison of niches as spatial hubs across tissues. Integrative analysis of primary estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and metaplastic breast cancer (MBC) tissues led to the identification of spatial hubs with patient- and disease-specific cell type compositions and revealed metabolic reprogramming shaping immunosuppressive hubs in aggressive MBC.
   Reference-free integrative analysis of spatial transcriptomics data is achieved with archetype analysis.

AB Data collection and processing timely is crucial for mobile crowd integrated sensing, communication, and computation (ISCC) systems with various applications such as smart home and connected cars, which requires numerous integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) devices to sense the targets and offload the data to the base station (BS) for further processing. However, as the number of ISAC devices grows, there exists intensive interactions among ISAC devices in the processes of data collection and processing since they share the common network resources. In this paper, we consider the environment sensing problem in the large-scale mobile crowd ISCC systems and propose an efficient waveform precoding design algorithm based on the mean field game (MFG). Specifically, to handle the complex interactions among large-scale ISAC devices, we first utilize the MFG method to transform the influence from other ISAC devices into the mean field term and derive the Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation, which models the evolution of the system state. Then, we derive the cost function based on the mean field term and reformulate the waveform precoding design problem. Next, we utilize the G-prox primal-dual hybrid gradient algorithm to solve the reformulated problem and analyze the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can solve the interactions among large-scale ISAC devices effectively in the ISCC process. In addition, compared with other baselines, the proposed waveform precoding design algorithm has advantages in improving communication performance and reducing cost function.

AB Advances in coherent light sources and development of pump-probe techniques in recent decades have opened the way to study electronic motion in its natural time scale. When an ultrashort laser pulse interacts with a molecular target, a coherent superposition of electronic states is created and the triggered electron dynamics is coupled to the nuclear motion. A natural and computationally efficient choice to simulate this correlated dynamics is a trajectory-based method where the quantum-mechanical electronic evolution is coupled to a classical-like nuclear dynamics. These methods must approximate the initial correlated electron-nuclear state by associating an initial electronic wavefunction to each classical trajectory in the ensemble. Different possibilities exist that reproduce the initial populations of the exact molecular wavefunction when represented in a basis. We show that different choices yield different dynamics and explore the effect of this choice in Ehrenfest, surface hopping, and exact-factorization-based coupled-trajectory schemes in a one-dimensional two-electronic-state model system that can be solved numerically exactly. This work aims to clarify the problems that standard trajectory-based techniques might have when a coherent superposition of electronic states is created to initialize the dynamics, to discuss what properties and observables are affected by different choices of electronic initial conditions and to point out the importance of quantum-momentum-induced electronic transitions in coupled-trajectory schemes.

AB Precise segmentation of rectal cancer tumors on routine MRI is critical for accurate clinical staging and downstream computational analyses. While deep learning-based segmentation algorithms have shown much promise in automating the otherwise tedious, subjective, and costly process of manual segmentation, they require significant amounts of manually annotated data for training. To address these limitations of deep learning-based segmentation models, we present a novel deep learning framework that incorporates human-in-the-loop (HITL) refinement to automatically delineate rectal tumors on multi-plane pre-treatment MR imaging. When evaluated on multiple holdout validation cohorts including a clinical trial dataset, the post-HITL segmentation model significantly outperformed the pre-HITL model with median dice similarity coefficient of 0.763 and Hausdorff distance of 28.4mm in comparison to 0.601 and 31.8mm, respectively. HITL refinement learning also significantly accelerated the manual annotation process by 20 minutes. HITL learning represents a feasible, effective, and efficient solution to semi-automated tumor segmentation on routine rectal cancer MRI scans.

AB Semantic communications can reduce the resource consumption by transmitting task-related semantic information extracted from source messages. However, when the source messages are utilized for various tasks, e.g., wireless sensing data for localization and activities detection, semantic communication technique is difficult to be implemented because of the increased processing complexity. In this paper, we propose the inverse semantic communications as a new paradigm. Instead of extracting semantic information from messages, we aim to encode the task-related source messages into a hyper-source message for data transmission or storage. Following this paradigm, we design an inverse semantic-aware wireless sensing framework with three algorithms for data sampling, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided encoding, and self-supervised decoding, respectively. Specifically, on the one hand, we propose a novel RIS hardware design for encoding several signal spectrums into one MetaSpectrum. To select the task-related signal spectrums for achieving efficient encoding, a semantic hash sampling method is introduced. On the other hand, we propose a self-supervised learning method for decoding the MetaSpectrums to obtain the original signal spectrums. Using the sensing data collected from real-world, we show that our framework can reduce the data volume by 95% compared to that before encoding, without affecting the accomplishment of sensing tasks. Moreover, compared with the typically used uniform sampling scheme, the proposed semantic hash sampling scheme can achieve 67% lower mean squared error in recovering the sensing parameters. In addition, experiment results demonstrate that the amplitude response matrix of the RIS enables the encryption of the sensing data.

In this work, a facile tensile testing platform for in situ characterization of materials inside a transmission electron microscope is demonstrated. The platform consists of: 1) a commercially available, flexible, electron-transparent substrate (e.g., TEM grid) integrated with a conventional tensile testing holder, and 2) a finite element simulation providing quantification of specimen-applied strain. The flexible substrate (carbon support film of the TEM grid) mitigates strain concentrations usually found in free-standing films and enables in situ straining experiments to be performed on materials that cannot undergo localized thinning or focused ion beam lift-out. The finite element simulation enables direct correlation of holder displacement with sample strain, providing upper and lower bounds of expected strain across the substrate. The tensile testing platform is validated for three disparate material systems: sputtered gold-palladium, few-layer transferred tungsten disulfide, and electrodeposited lithium, by measuring lattice strain from experimentally recorded electron diffraction data. The results show good agreement between experiment and simulation, providing confidence in the ability to transfer strain from holder to sample and relate TEM crystal structural observations with material mechanical properties.

AB Strong coupling between polarization (P) and strain (epsilon) in ferroelectric complex oxides offers unique opportunities to dramatically tune their properties. Here colossal strain tuning of ferroelectricity in epitaxial KNbO3 thin films grown by sub-oxide molecular beam epitaxy is demonstrated. While bulk KNbO3 exhibits three ferroelectric transitions and a Curie temperature (T-c) of approximate to 676 K, phase-field modeling predicts that a biaxial strain of as little as -0.6% pushes its T-c > 975 K, its decomposition temperature in air, and for -1.4% strain, to T-c > 1325 K, its melting point. Furthermore, a strain of -1.5% can stabilize a single phase throughout the entire temperature range of its stability. A combination of temperature-dependent second harmonic generation measurements, synchrotron-based X-ray reciprocal space mapping, ferroelectric measurements, and transmission electron microscopy reveal a single tetragonal phase from 10 K to 975 K, an enhancement of approximate to 46% in the tetragonal phase remanent polarization (P-r), and a approximate to 200% enhancement in its optical second harmonic generation coefficients over bulk values. These properties in a lead-free system, but with properties comparable or superior to lead-based systems, make it an attractive candidate for applications ranging from high-temperature ferroelectric memory to cryogenic temperature quantum computing.

AB The effects of fluctuations and disorder, which are substantially enhanced in reduced dimensionalities, can play a crucial role in producing non-trivial phases of matter such as vestigial orders characterized by a composite order parameter. However, fluctuation-driven magnetic phases in low dimensions have remained relatively unexplored. Here we demonstrate a phase transition from the zigzag antiferromagnetic order in the three-dimensional bulk to a Z3 vestigial Potts nematicity in two-dimensional few-layer samples of van der Waals magnet NiPS3. Our spin relaxometry and optical spectroscopy measurements reveal that the spin fluctuations are enhanced over the gigahertz to terahertz range as the layer number of NiPS3 reduces. Monte Carlo simulations corroborate the experimental finding of threefold rotational symmetry breaking but show that the translational symmetry is restored in thin layers of NiPS3. Therefore, our results show that strong quantum fluctuations can stabilize an unconventional magnetic phase after destroying a more conventional one.
   Magnetic phases that are stabilized by quantum fluctuations in low dimensions are rare. A thickness-dependent crossover from three-dimensional antiferromagnetism to a two-dimensional vestigial nematic state that is driven by fluctuations has now been observed.

   EVOLUTION
AB Soft chemistry techniques, such as ion exchange, hold great potential for the development of battery electrode materials that cannot be stabilized via conventional equilibrium synthesis methods. Nevertheless, the intricate mechanisms governing ion exchange remain elusive. Herein, we investigate the evolution of the long-range and local structure, as well as the ion (de)intercalation mechanism during electrochemical Li-to-Na ion exchange initiated from an O3-type lithium-layered oxide cathode. The in situ-formed mixed-cation electrolyte leads to competitive intercalation of Li and Na ions. While Li ion intercalation predominates at the beginning of initial discharge, Na ion cointercalation into a different layer results in ion redistribution and phase separation, with the emergence of a P3-Na phase alongside an O3-Li phase. Further, this study spatially resolves the heterogeneous nature of electrochemical ion exchange reactions within individual particles and provides insights into the correlations between local Ni redox processes and phase separation. Overall, electrochemical ion exchange leads to a mixed-phase cathode and alters its reaction kinetics. Those findings have important implications for the development of new metastable materials for renewable energy devices and ion separation applications.

ID LIPID-BILAYERS; ELASTIC PROPERTIES; PHASE; CURVATURE
AB An important mechanical property of cells is their membrane bending modulus, kappa. Here, we introduce MEDUSA (MEmbrane DiffUse Scattering Analysis), a cloud-based analysis tool to determine the bending modulus, kappa, from the analysis of X-ray diffuse scattering. MEDUSA uses GPU (graphics processing unit) accelerated hardware and a parallelized algorithm to run the calculations efficiently in a few seconds. MEDUSA's graphical user interface allows the user to upload 2-dimensional data collected from different sources, perform background subtraction and distortion corrections, select regions of interest, run the fitting procedure and output the fitted parameters, the membranes' bending modulus kappa, and compressional modulus B.

TI Quantification of Visceral Fat at the L5 Vertebral Body Level in
   Patients with Crohn's Disease Using T2-Weighted MRI
SO BIOENGINEERING-BASEL

DT Article
DE MRI; visceral fat; L5; umbilicus; Crohn's
AB The umbilical or L3 vertebral body level is often used for body fat quantification using computed tomography. To explore the feasibility of using clinically acquired pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for visceral fat measurement, we examined the correlation of visceral fat parameters at the umbilical and L5 vertebral body levels. We retrospectively analyzed T2-weighted half-Fourier acquisition single-shot turbo spin echo (HASTE) MR axial images from Crohn's disease patients who underwent MRI enterography of the abdomen and pelvis over a three-year period. We determined the area/volume of subcutaneous and visceral fat from the umbilical and L5 levels and calculated the visceral fat ratio (VFR = visceral fat/subcutaneous fat) and visceral fat index (VFI = visceral fat/total fat). Statistical analyses involved correlation analysis between both levels, inter-rater analysis between two investigators, and inter-platform analysis between two image-analysis platforms. Correlational analysis of 32 patients yielded significant associations for VFI (r = 0.85; p < 0.0001) and VFR (r = 0.74; p < 0.0001). Intraclass coefficients for VFI and VFR were 0.846 and 0.875 (good agreement) between investigators and 0.831 and 0.728 (good and moderate agreement) between platforms. Our study suggests that the L5 level on clinically acquired pelvic MRIs may serve as a reference point for visceral fat quantification.

TI Tuning the band topology of GdSb by epitaxial strain

DT Article
ID TUNABLE ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE; INITIO MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; SURFACE-STATES;
   TRANSITION; GAAS
AB Rare-earth monopnictide (RE-V) semimetal crystals subjected to hydrostatic pressure have shown interesting trends in magnetoresistance, magnetic ordering, and superconductivity, with theory predicting pressure-induced band inversion. Yet, thus far, there have been no direct experimental reports of interchanged band order in RE-Vs due to strain. This work studies the evolution of band topology in biaxially strained GdSb(001) epitaxial films using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT). As biaxial strain is tuned from tensile to compressive strain, the gap between the hole and the electron bands dispersed along [001] decreases. The conduction and valence band shifts seen in DFT and ARPES measurements are explained by a tight-binding model that accounts for the orbital symmetry of each band. Finally, we discuss the effect of biaxial strain on carrier compensation and magnetic ordering temperature.(c) 2023 Author(s).

AB Selfish genetic elements comprise significant fractions of mammalian genomes. In rare instances, host genomes domesticate segments of these elements for function. Using a complete human genome assembly and 25 additional vertebrate genomes, we re-analyzed the evolutionary trajectories and functional potential of capsid (CA) genes domesticated from Metaviridae, a lineage of retrovirus-like retrotransposons. Our study expands on previous analyses to unearth several new insights about the evolutionary histories of these ancient genes. We find that at least five independent domestication events occurred from diverse Metaviridae, giving rise to three universally retained single-copy genes evolving under purifying selection and two gene families unique to placental mammals, with multiple members showing evidence of rapid evolution. In the SIRH/RTL family, we find diverse amino-terminal domains, widespread loss of protein-coding capacity in RTL10 despite its retention in several mammalian lineages, and differential utilization of an ancient programmed ribosomal frameshift in RTL3 between the domesticated CA and protease domains. Our analyses also reveal that most members of the PNMA family in mammalian genomes encode a conserved putative amino-terminal RNA-binding domain (RBD) both adjoining and independent from domesticated CA domains. Our analyses lead to a significant correction of previous annotations of the essential CCDC8 gene. We show that this putative RBD is also present in several extant Metaviridae, revealing a novel protein domain configuration in retrotransposons. Collectively, our study reveals the divergent outcomes of multiple domestication events from diverse Metaviridae in the common ancestor of placental mammals.

TI Regioselective On-Surface Synthesis of [3]Triangulene Graphene
   Nanoribbons
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
AB The integration of low-energy states into bottom-up engineered graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) is a robust strategy for realizing materials with tailored electronic band structure for nanoelectronics. Low-energy zero-modes (ZMs) can be introduced into nanographenes (NGs) by creating an imbalance between the two sublattices of graphene. This phenomenon is exemplified by the family of [n]triangulenes (n is an element of N ). Here, we demonstrate the synthesis of [3]triangulene-GNRs, a regioregular one-dimensional (1D) chain of [3]triangulenes linked by five-membered rings. Hybridization between ZMs on adjacent [3]triangulenes leads to the emergence of a narrow band gap, E-g,E-exp similar to 0.7 eV, and topological end states that are experimentally verified using scanning tunneling spectroscopy. Tight-binding and first-principles density functional theory calculations within the local density approximation corroborate our experimental observations. Our synthetic design takes advantage of a selective on-surface head-to-tail coupling of monomer building blocks enabling the regioselective synthesis of [3]triangulene-GNRs. Detailed ab initio theory provides insights into the mechanism of on-surface radical polymerization, revealing the pivotal role of Au-C bond formation/breakage in driving selectivity.

TI Gapless assembly of complete human and plant chromosomes using only
   nanopore sequencing
SO GENOME RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID GENOME; DNA; CHALLENGES
AB The combination of ultra-long (UL) Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing reads with long, accurate Pacific Bioscience (PacBio) High Fidelity (HiFi) reads has enabled the completion of a human genome and spurred similar efforts to complete the genomes of many other species. However, this approach for complete, "telomere-to-telomere" genome assembly relies on multiple sequencing platforms, limiting its accessibility. ONT "Duplex" sequencing reads, where both strands of the DNA are read to improve quality, promise high per-base accuracy. To evaluate this new data type, we generated ONT Duplex data for three widely studied genomes: human HG002, Solanum lycopersicum Heinz 1706 (tomato), and Zea mays B73 (maize). For the diploid, heterozygous HG002 genome, we also used "Pore-C" chromatin contact mapping to completely phase the haplotypes. We found the accuracy of Duplex data to be similar to HiFi sequencing, but with read lengths tens of kilobases longer, and the Pore-C data to be compatible with existing diploid assembly algorithms. This combination of read length and accuracy enables the construction of a high-quality initial assembly, which can then be further resolved using the UL reads, and finally phased into chromosome-scale haplotypes with Pore-C. The resulting assemblies have a base accuracy exceeding 99.999% (Q50) and near-perfect continuity, with most chromosomes assembled as single contigs. We conclude that ONT sequencing is a viable alternative to HiFi sequencing for de novo genome assembly, and provides a multirun single-instrument solution for the reconstruction of complete genomes.

TI Evaluating the relationship between magnetic resonance image quality
   metrics and deep learning-based segmentation accuracy of brain tumors

AB BackgroundMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans are known to suffer from a variety of acquisition artifacts as well as equipment-based variations that impact image appearance and segmentation performance. It is still unclear whether a direct relationship exists between magnetic resonance (MR) image quality metrics (IQMs) (e.g., signal-to-noise, contrast-to-noise) and segmentation accuracy.PurposeDeep learning (DL) approaches have shown significant promise for automated segmentation of brain tumors on MRI but depend on the quality of input training images. We sought to evaluate the relationship between IQMs of input training images and DL-based brain tumor segmentation accuracy toward developing more generalizable models for multi-institutional data.MethodsWe trained a 3D DenseNet model on the BraTS 2020 cohorts for segmentation of tumor subregions enhancing tumor (ET), peritumoral edematous, and necrotic and non-ET on MRI; with performance quantified via a 5-fold cross-validated Dice coefficient. MRI scans were evaluated through the open-source quality control tool MRQy, to yield 13 IQMs per scan. The Pearson correlation coefficient was computed between whole tumor (WT) dice values and IQM measures in the training cohorts to identify quality measures most correlated with segmentation performance. Each selected IQM was used to group MRI scans as "better" quality (BQ) or "worse" quality (WQ), via relative thresholding. Segmentation performance was re-evaluated for the DenseNet model when (i) training on BQ MRI images with validation on WQ images, as well as (ii) training on WQ images, and validation on BQ images. Trends were further validated on independent test sets derived from the BraTS 2021 training cohorts.ResultsFor this study, multimodal MRI scans from the BraTS 2020 training cohorts were used to train the segmentation model and validated on independent test sets derived from the BraTS 2021 cohort. Among the selected IQMs, models trained on BQ images based on inhomogeneity measurements (coefficient of variance, coefficient of joint variation, coefficient of variation of the foreground patch) and the models trained on WQ images based on noise measurement peak signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) yielded significantly improved tumor segmentation accuracy compared to their inverse models.ConclusionsOur results suggest that a significant correlation may exist between specific MR IQMs and DenseNet-based brain tumor segmentation performance. The selection of MRI scans for model training based on IQMs may yield more accurate and generalizable models in unseen validation.

DE Mobile edge computing; generative artificial intelligence; pretrained
   foundation models; joint foundation model caching and inference
AB With the rapid development of artificial general intelligence (AGI), various multimedia services based on pretrained foundation models (PFMs) need to be effectively deployed. With edge servers that have cloud-level computing power, edge intelligence can extend the capabilities of AGI to mobile edge networks. However, compared with cloud data centers, resource-limited edge servers can only cache and execute a small number of PFMs, which typically consist of billions of parameters and require intensive computing power and GPU memory during inference. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a joint foundation model caching and inference framework that aims to balance the tradeoff among inference latency, accuracy, and resource consumption by managing cached PFMs and user requests efficiently during the provisioning of generative AI services. Specifically, considering the in-context learning ability of PFMs, a new metric named the Age of Context (AoC), is proposed to model the freshness and relevance between examples in past demonstrations and current service requests. Based on the AoC, we propose a least context caching algorithm to manage cached PFMs at edge servers with historical prompts and inference results. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can reduce system costs compared with existing baselines by effectively utilizing contextual information.

AB The future sixth-generation (6G) of wireless networks is expected to surpass its predecessors by offering ubiquitous coverage through integrated air-ground deployments in both communication and computing domains. In such networks, aerial platforms, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), conduct artificial intelligence (AI) computations based on multi-modal data to support diverse applications including surveillance and environment construction. However, these multi-domain inference and content generation tasks require large AI models, demanding powerful computing capabilities and finely tuned inference models trained on rich datasets, thus posing significant challenges for UAVs. To tackle this problem, we propose an integrated air-ground edge-cloud model framework, in which UAVs serve as edge nodes for data collection and small model computation. Through wireless channels, UAVs collaborate with ground cloud servers providing large model computation and model updating for edge UAVs. With limited wireless communication bandwidth, the proposed framework faces the challenge of information exchange scheduling between the edge UAVs and the cloud server. To tackle this, we present joint task allocation, transmission resource allocation, transmission data quantization design, and edge model update design to enhance the inference accuracy of the integrated air-ground edge-cloud model evolution framework by mean average precision (mAP) maximization. A closed-form lower bound on the mAP of the proposed framework is derived based on the mAP of the edge model and mAP of the cloud model, and the solution to the mAP maximization problem is optimized accordingly. Simulations, based on results from vision-based classification experiments, consistently demonstrate that the mAP of the proposed integrated air-ground edge-cloud model evolution framework outperforms both a centralized cloud model framework and a distributed edge model framework across various communication bandwidths and data sizes.

TI Biofilms as self-shaping growing nematics

AB Active nematics are the non-equilibrium analogue of passive liquid crystals. They consist of anisotropic units that consume free energy to drive emergent behaviour. As with liquid crystal molecules in displays, ordering and dynamics in active nematics are sensitive to boundary conditions. However, unlike passive liquid crystals, active nematics have the potential to regulate their boundaries through self-generated stresses. Here we show how a three-dimensional, living nematic can actively shape itself and its boundary to regulate its internal architecture through growth-induced stresses, using bacterial biofilms confined by a hydrogel as a model system. We show that biofilms exhibit a sharp transition in shape from domes to lenses in response to changing environmental stiffness or cell-substrate friction, which is explained by a theoretical model that considers the competition between confinement and interfacial forces. The growth mode defines the progression of the boundary, which in turn determines the trajectories and spatial distribution of cell lineages. We further demonstrate that the evolving boundary and corresponding stress anisotropy define the orientational ordering of cells and the emergence of topological defects in the biofilm interior. Our findings may provide strategies for the development of programmed microbial consortia with emergent material properties.
   Confined biofilms can shape themselves and their boundary to modify their internal organisation. This mechanism could inform the development of active materials that control their own geometry.

AB Metagenomics has revolutionized our understanding of microbial communities, offering unprecedented insights into their genetic and functional diversity across Earth's diverse ecosystems. Beyond their roles as environmental constituents, microbiomes act as symbionts, profoundly influencing the health and function of their host organisms. Given the inherent complexity of these communities and the diverse environments where they reside, the components of a metagenomics study must be carefully tailored to yield accurate results that are representative of the populations of interest. This Primer examines the methodological advancements and current practices that have shaped the field, from initial stages of sample collection and DNA extraction to the advanced bioinformatics tools employed for data analysis, with a particular focus on the profound impact of next-generation sequencing on the scale and accuracy of metagenomics studies. We critically assess the challenges and limitations inherent in metagenomics experimentation, available technologies and computational analysis methods. Beyond technical methodologies, we explore the application of metagenomics across various domains, including human health, agriculture and environmental monitoring. Looking ahead, we advocate for the development of more robust computational frameworks and enhanced interdisciplinary collaborations. This Primer serves as a comprehensive guide for advancing the precision and applicability of metagenomic studies, positioning them to address the complexities of microbial ecology and their broader implications for human health and environmental sustainability.

ID PEPTIDE; HYDROGELS; AGGREGATION; DOMAIN
AB Protein hydrogels represent an important and growing biomaterial for a multitude of applications, including diagnostics and drug delivery. We have previously explored the ability to engineer the thermoresponsive supramolecular assembly of coiled-coil proteins into hydrogels with varying gelation properties, where we have defined important parameters in the coiled-coil hydrogel design. Using Rosetta energy scores and Poisson-Boltzmann electrostatic energies, we iterate a computational design strategy to predict the gelation of coiled-coil proteins while simultaneously exploring five new coiled-coil protein hydrogel sequences. Provided this library, we explore the impact of in silico energies on structure and gelation kinetics, where we also reveal a range of blue autofluorescence that enables hydrogel disassembly and recovery. As a result of this library, we identify the new coiled-coil hydrogel sequence, Q5, capable of gelation within 24 h at 4 degrees C, a more than 2-fold increase over that of our previous iteration Q2. The fast gelation time of Q5 enables the assessment of structural transition in real time using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) that is correlated to coarse-grained and atomistic molecular dynamics simulations revealing the supramolecular assembling behavior of coiled-coils toward nanofiber assembly and gelation. This work represents the first system of hydrogels with predictable self-assembly, autofluorescent capability, and a molecular model of coiled-coil fiber formation.

TI Transversity PDFs of the proton from lattice QCD with physical quark

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
LA English
DT Article
ID PARTON DISTRIBUTIONS; ANOMALOUS DIMENSION; COLLINS
AB We present a lattice QCD calculation of the transversity isovector- and isoscalar-quark parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton utilizing a perturbative matching at next-to-leading-order (NLO) accuracy. Additionally, we determine the isovector and isoscalar tensor charges for the proton. In both calculations, the disconnected contributions to the isoscalar matrix elements have been ignored. The calculations are performed using a single ensemble of Nf = 2 thorn 1 highly improved staggered quarks simulated with physical-mass quarks anda lattice spacing of a = 0.076 fm. The Wilson-clover action, with physical quark masses and smeared gauge links obtained from one iteration of hypercubic smearing, is used in the valence sector. Using the NLO operator product expansion, we extract the lowest four to six Mellin moments and the PDFs via a neural network from the matrix elements in the pseudo-PDF approach. In addition, we calculate the PDFs in the quasi-PDF approach with hybrid-scheme renormalization and the recently developed leading-renormalon resummation technique, at NLO with the resummation of leading small -x logarithms.

SO MATERIALS TODAY PHYSICS

ID TOTAL-ENERGY CALCULATIONS; 2-DIMENSIONAL MATERIALS; PLATFORM
AB The accuracy of a machine learning model is limited by the quality and quantity of the data available for its training and validation. This problem is particularly challenging in materials science, where large, high-quality, and consistent datasets are scarce. Here we present ALEXANDRIA, , an open database of more than 5 million density-functional theory calculations for periodic three-, two-, and one-dimensional compounds. We use this data to train machine learning models to reproduce seven different properties using both composition-based models and crystal-graph neural networks. In the majority of cases, the error of the models decreases monotonically with the training data, although some graph networks seem to saturate for large training set sizes. Differences in the training can be correlated with the statistical distribution of the different properties. We also observe that graph-networks, that have access to detailed geometrical information, yield in general more accurate models than simple composition-based methods. Finally, we assess several universal machine learning interatomic potentials. Crystal geometries optimised with these force fields are very high quality, but unfortunately the accuracy of the energies is still lacking. Furthermore, we observe some instabilities for regions of chemical space that are undersampled in the training sets used for these models. This study highlights the potential of large-scale, high-quality datasets to improve machine learning models in materials science.

AB Nitriles are uncommon in nature and are typically constructed from oximes through the oxidative decarboxylation of amino acid substrates or from the derivatization of carboxylic acids. Here we report a third nitrile biosynthesis strategy featuring the cyanobacterial nitrile synthase AetD. During the biosynthesis of the eagle-killing neurotoxin, aetokthonotoxin, AetD transforms the 2-aminopropionate portion of 5,7-dibromo-l-tryptophan to a nitrile. Employing a combination of structural, biochemical and biophysical techniques, we characterized AetD as a non-haem diiron enzyme that belongs to the emerging haem-oxygenase-like dimetal oxidase superfamily. High-resolution crystal structures of AetD together with the identification of catalytically relevant products provide mechanistic insights into how AetD affords this unique transformation, which we propose proceeds via an aziridine intermediate. Our work presents a unique template for nitrile biogenesis and portrays a substrate binding and metallocofactor assembly mechanism that may be shared among other haem-oxygenase-like dimetal oxidase enzymes.
   Nitrile-containing molecules and their biosynthetic enzymes are uncommon in nature. Now, a nitrile-forming diiron enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of aetokthonotoxin-the 'eagle-killing' neurotoxin-has been characterized using biochemical, structural and biophysical methods. High-resolution protein crystal structures together with the identification of catalytically relevant tryptophan-based products provide mechanistic insights into this unusual nitrile-forming reaction.

AB Sixth-Generation (6G) technologies will revolutionize the wireless ecosystem by enabling the delivery of futuristic services through satellite-terrestrial integrated networks (STINs). As the number of subscribers connected to STINs increases, it becomes necessary to investigate whether the edge computing paradigm may be applied to low Earth orbit satellite (LEOS) networks for supporting computation-intensive and delay-sensitive services for anyone, anywhere, and at any time. Inspired by this research dilemma, we investigate a LEOS edge-assisted multi-layer multi-access edge computing (MEC) system. In this system, the MEC philosophy will be extended to LEOS, for defining the LEOS edge, in order to enhance the coverage of the multi-layer MEC system and address the users' computing problems both in congested and isolated areas. We then design its operating offloading framework and explore its feasible implementation methodologies. In this context, we formulate a joint optimization problem for the associated communication and computation resource allocation for minimizing the overall energy dissipation of our LEOS edge-assisted multi-layer MEC system while maintaining a low computing latency. To solve the optimization problem effectively, we adopt the classic alternating optimization (AO) method for decomposing the original problem and then solve each sub-problem using low-complexity iterative algorithms. Finally, our numerical results show that the offloading scheme conceived achieves low computing latency and energy dissipation compared to the state-of-the-art solutions, a single layer MEC supported by LEOS or base stations (BS).

TI Dynamic Nanocrystal Superlattices with Thermally Triggerable Lubricating
   Ligands
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY

ID NANOPARTICLE SUPERLATTICES; SHAPE; SIMULATIONS; DESIGN
AB The size-dependent and collective physical properties of nanocrystals (NCs) and their self-assembled superlattices (SLs) enable the study of mesoscale phenomena and the design of metamaterials for a broad range of applications. However, the limited mobility of NC building blocks in dried NCSLs often hampers the potential for employing postdeposition methods to produce high-quality NCSLs. In this study, we present tailored promesogenic ligands that exhibit a lubricating property akin to thermotropic liquid crystals. The lubricating ability of ligands is thermally triggerable, allowing the dry solid NC aggregates deposited on the substrates with poor ordering to be transformed into NCSLs with high crystallinity and preferred orientations. The interplay between the dynamic behavior of NCSLs and the molecular structure of the ligands is elucidated through a comprehensive analysis of their lubricating efficacy using both experimental and simulation approaches. Coarse-grained molecular dynamic modeling suggests that a shielding layer from mesogens prevents the interdigitation of ligand tails, facilitating the sliding between outer shells and consequently enhancing the mobility of NC building blocks. The dynamic organization of NCSLs can also be triggered with high spatial resolution by laser illumination. The principles, kinetics, and utility of lubricating ligands could be generalized to unlock stimuli-responsive metamaterials from NCSLs and contribute to the fabrication of NCSLs.

AB The authors describe the mechanism of exo-endocytosis coupling at synapses. They find that actin forms a ring around the region of exocytosis. This ring conserves membrane area, allowing induction of inward membrane buckling following exocytosis.
   Compensatory endocytosis keeps the membrane surface area of secretory cells constant following exocytosis. At chemical synapses, clathrin-independent ultrafast endocytosis maintains such homeostasis. This endocytic pathway is temporally and spatially coupled to exocytosis; it initiates within 50 ms at the region immediately next to the active zone where vesicles fuse. However, the coupling mechanism is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that filamentous actin is organized as a ring, surrounding the active zone at mouse hippocampal synapses. Assuming the membrane area conservation is due to this actin ring, our theoretical model suggests that flattening of fused vesicles exerts lateral compression in the plasma membrane, resulting in rapid formation of endocytic pits at the border between the active zone and the surrounding actin-enriched region. Consistent with model predictions, our data show that ultrafast endocytosis requires sufficient compression by exocytosis of multiple vesicles and does not initiate when actin organization is disrupted, either pharmacologically or by ablation of the actin-binding protein Epsin1. Our work suggests that membrane mechanics underlie the rapid coupling of exocytosis to endocytosis at synapses.

ID EXPRESSION; MELANOMA
AB Single-cell genomics enables dissection of tumor heterogeneity and molecular underpinnings of drug response at an unprecedented resolution(1-11). However, broad clinical application of these methods remains challenging, due to several practical and preanalytical challenges that are incompatible with typical clinical care workflows, namely the need for relatively large, fresh tissue inputs. In the present study, we show that multimodal, single-nucleus (sn)RNA/T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing, spatial transcriptomics and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) are feasible from small, frozen tissues that approximate routinely collected clinical specimens (for example, core needle biopsies). Compared with data from sample-matched fresh tissue, we find a similar quality in the biological outputs of snRNA/TCR-seq data, while reducing artifactual signals and compositional biases introduced by fresh tissue processing. Profiling sequentially collected melanoma samples from a patient treated in the KEYNOTE-001 trial(12), we resolved cellular, genomic, spatial and clonotype dynamics that represent molecular patterns of heterogeneous intralesional evolution during anti-programmed cell death protein 1 therapy. To demonstrate applicability to banked biospecimens of rare diseases(13), we generated a single-cell atlas of uveal melanoma liver metastasis with matched WGS data. These results show that single-cell genomics from archival, clinical specimens is feasible and provides a framework for translating these methods more broadly to the clinical arena.

ID MEMORY; IMPAIRMENT; PATTERNS; SPIKES
AB Objective: Cognitive impairment often impacts quality of life in epilepsy even if seizures are controlled. Word-finding difficulty is particularly prevalent and often attributed to etiological (static, baseline) circuit alterations. We sought to determine whether interictal discharges convey significant superimposed contributions to word-finding difficulty in patients, and if so, through which cognitive mechanism(s).Methods: Twenty-three patients undergoing intracranial monitoring for drug-resistant epilepsy participated in multiple tasks involving word production (auditory naming, short-term verbal free recall, repetition) to probe word-finding difficulty across different cognitive domains. We compared behavioral performance between trials with versus without interictal discharges across six major brain areas and adjusted for intersubject differences using mixed-effects models. We also evaluated for subjective word-finding difficulties through retrospective chart review.Results: Subjective word-finding difficulty was reported by the majority (79%) of studied patients preoperatively. During intracranial recordings, interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) in the medial temporal lobe were associated with long-term lexicosemantic memory impairments as indexed by auditory naming (p = .009), in addition to their established impact on short-term verbal memory as indexed by free recall (p = .004). Interictal discharges involving the lateral temporal cortex and lateral frontal cortex were associated with delayed reaction time in the auditory naming task (p = .016 and p = .018), as well as phonological working memory impairments as indexed by repetition reaction time (p = .002). Effects of IEDs across anatomical regions were strongly dependent on their precise timing within the task.Significance: IEDs appear to act through multiple cognitive mechanisms to form a convergent basis for the debilitating clinical word-finding difficulty reported by patients with epilepsy. This was particularly notable for medial temporal spikes, which are quite common in adult focal epilepsy. In parallel with the treatment of seizures, the modulation of interictal discharges through emerging pharmacological means and neurostimulation approaches may be an opportunity to help address devastating memory and language impairments in epilepsy.

TI Comprehensive analysis of ordering in CoCrNi and CrNi<sub>2</sub> alloys
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
ID SHORT-RANGE ORDER
AB Chemical Short-Range Order (CSRO) has attracted recent attention from many researchers, creating intense debates about its impact on material properties. The challenges lie in confirming and quantifying CSRO, as its detection proves exceptionally demanding, contributing to conflicting data in the literature regarding its true effects on mechanical properties. Our work uses high-precision calorimetric data to unambiguously prove the existence and, coupled with atomistic simulations, quantify the type of CSRO. This methodology allows us to propose a mechanism for its formation and destruction based on the heat evolution during thermal analysis and facilitates a precise identification of local ordering in CoCrNi alloys. Samples of CoCrNi (Co33Cr33Ni33) and CrNi2 (Cr33Ni66) alloys are fabricated in varying ordered states, extensively characterized via synchrotron X-ray diffraction, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. Samples with considerably different ordered states are submitted to tensile tests with in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction. We demonstrate, despite inducing varied CSRO levels in CoCrNi, no significant alterations in overall mechanical behavior emerge. However, the CrNi2 alloy, which undergoes long-range ordering, experiences significant shifts in yield strength, ultimate tensile stress and ductility.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B

   NITRIDES; CARBIDES
AB Wurtzite LaN (wz-LaN) is a semiconducting nitride that has piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties, making it promising for applications in electronics, either as a binary compound or in alloys such as LaAlN. The prospects for wz-LaN in devices are influenced by the properties of point defects and impurities; here, we use first-principles density functional theory with a hybrid functional to calculate their formation energies, as well as their atomic and electronic structures. Among native point defects, we find that nitrogen-related defects, both vacancies (VN+ ) and interstitials (N-i), are energetically most favorable under most relevant chemical potentials and positions of the Fermi level; VN0 may additionally be observed under N-poor conditions, and N0i may be prominent under N-rich conditions. We also investigate the incorporation of oxygen and hydrogen, which will likely be present as unintentional impurities. We find that the O+N substitutional species readily forms, but oxygen will not lead to n-type conductivity due to formation of DX centers and compensation by interstitial defects. Similarly, substitutional HN and interstitial Hi can compensate both p- and n-type dopants. Our results provide detailed, microscopic guidance for the development of electronic devices based on wz-LaN.

TI Calibrated geometric deep learning improves kinase-drug binding

AB Protein kinases regulate various cellular functions and hold significant pharmacological promise in cancer and other diseases. Although kinase inhibitors are one of the largest groups of approved drugs, much of the human kinome remains unexplored but potentially druggable. Computational approaches, such as machine learning, offer efficient solutions for exploring kinase-compound interactions and uncovering novel binding activities. Despite the increasing availability of three-dimensional (3D) protein and compound structures, existing methods predominantly focus on exploiting local features from one-dimensional protein sequences and two-dimensional molecular graphs to predict binding affinities, overlooking the 3D nature of the binding process. Here we present KDBNet, a deep learning algorithm that incorporates 3D protein and molecule structure data to predict binding affinities. KDBNet uses graph neural networks to learn structure representations of protein binding pockets and drug molecules, capturing the geometric and spatial characteristics of binding activity. In addition, we introduce an algorithm to quantify and calibrate the uncertainties of KDBNet's predictions, enhancing its utility in model-guided discovery in chemical or protein space. Experiments demonstrated that KDBNet outperforms existing deep learning models in predicting kinase-drug binding affinities. The uncertainties estimated by KDBNet are informative and well-calibrated with respect to prediction errors. When integrated with a Bayesian optimization framework, KDBNet enables data-efficient active learning and accelerates the exploration and exploitation of diverse high-binding kinase-drug pairs.
   Geometric deep learning has become a powerful tool in virtual drug design, but it is not always obvious when a model makes incorrect predictions. Luo and colleagues improve the accuracy of their deep learning model using uncertainty calibration and Bayesian optimization in an active learning cycle.

TI Solvent-Mediated, Reversible Ternary Graphite Intercalation Compounds
   for Extreme-Condition Li-Ion Batteries
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
LA English

ID ELECTROCHEMICAL INTERCALATION; LITHIUM INTERCALATION; ELECTRODE
AB Traditional Li-ion intercalation chemistry into graphite anodes exclusively utilizes the cointercalation-free or cointercalation mechanism. The latter mechanism is based on ternary graphite intercalation compounds (t-GICs), where glyme solvents were explored and proved to deliver unsatisfactory cyclability in LIBs. Herein, we report a novel intercalation mechanism, that is, in situ synthesis of t-GIC in the tetrahydrofuran (THF) electrolyte via a spontaneous, controllable reaction between binary-GIC (b-GIC) and free THF molecules during initial graphite lithiation. The spontaneous transformation from b-GIC to t-GIC, which is different from conventional cointercalation chemistry, is characterized and quantified via operando synchrotron X-ray and electrochemical analyses. The resulting t-GIC chemistry obviates the necessity for complete Li-ion desolvation, facilitating rapid kinetics and synchronous charge/discharge of graphite particles, even under high current densities. Consequently, the graphite anode demonstrates unprecedented fast charging (1 min), dendrite-free low-temperature performance, and ultralong lifetimes exceeding 10 000 cycles. Full cells coupled with a layered cathode display remarkable cycling stability upon a 15 min charging and excellent rate capability even at -40 degrees C. Furthermore, our chemical strategies are shown to extend beyond Li-ion batteries to encompass Na-ion and K-ion batteries, underscoring their broad applicability. Our work contributes to the advancement of graphite intercalation chemistry and presents a low-cost, adaptable approach for achieving fast-charging and low-temperature batteries.

   TEMPERATURE; EMITTERS
AB Tightly bound electron-hole pairs (excitons) hosted in atomically-thin semiconductors have emerged as prospective elements in optoelectronic devices for ultrafast and secured information transfer. The controlled exciton transport in such excitonic devices requires manipulating potential energy gradient of charge-neutral excitons, while electrical gating or nanoscale straining have shown limited efficiency of exciton transport at room temperature. Here, we report strain gradient induced exciton transport in monolayer tungsten diselenide (WSe2) across microns at room temperature via steady-state pump-probe measurement. Wrinkle architecture enabled optically-resolvable local strain (2.4%) and energy gradient (49 meV/mu m) to WSe2. We observed strain gradient induced flux of high-energy excitons and emission of funneled, low-energy excitons at the 2.5 mu m-away pump point with nearly 45% of relative emission intensity compared to that of excited excitons. Our results strongly support the strain-driven manipulation of exciton funneling in two-dimensional semiconductors at room temperature, opening up future opportunities of 2D straintronic exciton devices.

AB New astronomical observations point to a nucleosynthesis picture that goes beyond what was accepted until recently. The intermediate " i " process was proposed as a plausible scenario to explain some of the unusual abundance patterns observed in metal -poor stars. The most important nuclear physics properties entering iprocess calculations are the neutron -capture cross sections and they are almost exclusively not known experimentally. Here we provide the first experimental constraints on the 139 Ba( n, gamma ) 140 Ba reaction rate, which is the dominant source of uncertainty for the production of lanthanum, a key indicator of iprocess conditions. This is an important step towards identifying the exact astrophysical site of stars carrying the iprocess signature.

AB The evolution of flight in an early winged insect ancestral lineage is recognized as a key adaptation explaining the unparalleled success and diversification of insects. Subsequent transitions and modifications to flight machinery, including secondary reductions and losses, also play a central role in shaping the impacts of insects on broadscale geographic and ecological processes and patterns in the present and future. Given the importance of insect flight, there has been a centuries-long history of research and debate on the evolutionary origins and biological mechanisms of flight. Here, we revisit this history from an interdisciplinary perspective, discussing recent discoveries regarding the developmental origins, physiology, biomechanics, and neurobiology and sensory control of flight in a diverse set of insect models. We also identify major outstanding questions yet to be addressed and provide recommendations for overcoming current methodological challenges faced when studying insect flight, which will allow the field to continue to move forward in new and exciting directions. By integrating mechanistic work into ecological and evolutionary contexts, we hope that this synthesis promotes and stimulates new interdisciplinary research efforts necessary to close the many existing gaps about the causes and consequences of insect flight evolution.

AB MXenes are a rapidly growing family of 2D transition metal carbides and nitrides that are promising for various applications, including energy storage and conversion, electronics, and healthcare. Hydrofluoric-acid-based etchants are typically used for large-scale and high-throughput synthesis of MXenes, which also leads to a mixture of surface terminations that impede MXene properties. Herein, a computational thermodynamic model with experimental validation is presented to explore the feasibility of fluorine-free synthesis of MXenes with uniform surface terminations by dry selective extraction (DSE) from precursor MAX phases using iodine vapors. A range of MXenes and respective precursor compositions are systematically screened using first-principles calculations to find candidates with high phase stability and low etching energy. A thermodynamic model based on the "CALculation of PHAse Diagrams" (CALPHAD) approach is further demonstrated, using Ti3C2I2 as an example, to assess the Gibbs free energy of the DSE reaction and the state of the byproducts as a function of temperature and pressure. Based on the assessment, the optimal synthesis temperature and vapor pressure are predicted and further verified by experiments. This work opens an avenue for scalable, fluorine-free dry synthesis of MXenes with compositions and surface chemistries that are not accessible using wet chemical etching.
   The feasibility of a dry, fluorine-free MXene synthesis route is investigated through quantum mechanics calculations and thermodynamic modeling. Computational insights are experimentally validated to demonstrate synthesis of MXenes through dry selective extraction (DSE) of MAX phase precursors using iodine vapor under suitable temperatures and pressures. The DSE approach opens avenues for the sustainable and scalable synthesis of new MXenes.image

AB Massive stars are a major source of chemical elements in the cosmos, ejecting freshly produced nuclei through winds and core-collapse supernova explosions into the interstellar medium. Among the material ejected, long-lived radioisotopes, such as 60Fe (iron) and 26Al (aluminum), offer unique signs of active nucleosynthesis in our galaxy. There is a long-standing discrepancy between the observed 60Fe/26Al ratio by gamma-ray telescopes and predictions from supernova models. This discrepancy has been attributed to uncertainties in the nuclear reaction networks producing 60Fe, and one reaction in particular, the neutron-capture on 59Fe. Here we present experimental results that provide a strong constraint on this reaction. We use these results to show that the production of 60Fe in massive stars is higher than previously thought, further increasing the discrepancy between observed and predicted 60Fe/26Al ratios. The persisting discrepancy can therefore not be attributed to nuclear uncertainties, and points to issues in massive-star models.
   60Fe and 26Al provide insights about active nucleosynthesis in our galaxy and there is a discrepancy between observed and theoretically predicted ratios. Here, the authors show that this discrepancy is higher than previously found.

AB It is shown that structural disorder-in the form of anisotropic, picoscale atomic displacements-modulates the refractive index tensor and results in the giant optical anisotropy observed in BaTiS3, a quasi-1D hexagonal chalcogenide. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies reveal the presence of antipolar displacements of Ti atoms within adjacent TiS6 chains along the c-axis, and threefold degenerate Ti displacements in the a-b plane. 47/49Ti solid-state NMR provides additional evidence for those Ti displacements in the form of a three-horned NMR lineshape resulting from a low symmetry local environment around Ti atoms. Scanning transmission electron microscopy is used to directly observe the globally disordered Ti a-b plane displacements and find them to be ordered locally over a few unit cells. First-principles calculations show that the Ti a-b plane displacements selectively reduce the refractive index along the ab-plane, while having minimal impact on the refractive index along the chain direction, thus resulting in a giant enhancement in the optical anisotropy. By showing a strong connection between structural disorder with picoscale displacements and the optical response in BaTiS3, this study opens a pathway for designing optical materials with high refractive index and functionalities such as large optical anisotropy and nonlinearity.
   At room temperature, quasi-1D chalcogenide crystal BaTiS3 shows structural disorder due to off-centering Ti displacements along the ab-plane that is perpendicular to the long axis. These disordered Ti displacements selectively reduce the refractive index along the ab-plane and result in a giant enhancement of optical anisotropy. Thus, structural disorder provides a new degree-of-freedom for light manipulation in photonic applications. image

AB Antarctic atmospheric rivers (ARs) are a form of extreme weather that transport heat and moisture from the Southern Hemisphere subtropics and/or mid-latitudes to the Antarctic continent. Present-day AR events generally have a positive influence on the Antarctic ice-sheet mass balance by producing heavy snowfall, yet they also cause melt of sea ice and coastal ice sheet areas, as well as ice shelf destabilization. In this Review, we explore the atmospheric dynamics and impacts of Antarctic ARs over their life cycle to better understand their net contributions to ice-sheet mass balance. ARs occur in high-amplitude pressure couplets, and those strong enough to reach the Antarctic are often formed within Rossby waves initiated by tropical convection. Antarctic ARs are rare events (similar to 3 days per year per location) but have been responsible for 50-70% of extreme snowfall events in East Antarctica since the 1980s. However, they can also trigger extensive surface melting events, such as the final ice shelf collapse of Larsen A in 1995 and Larsen B in 2002. Climate change will likely cause stronger ARs as anthropogenic warming increases atmospheric water vapour. Future research must determine how these climate change impacts will alter the relationship among Antarctic ARs, net ice-sheet mass balance and future sea-level rise.

AB Although social interactions are known to drive pathogen transmission, the contributions of socially transmissible host-associated mutualists and commensals to host health and disease remain poorly explored. We use the concept of the social microbiome-the microbial metacommunity of a social network of hosts-to analyze the implications of social microbial transmission for host health and disease. We investigate the contributions of socially transmissible microbes to both eco-evolutionary microbiome community processes (colonization resistance, the evolution of virulence, and reactions to ecological disturbance) and microbial transmission-based processes (transmission of microbes with metabolic and immune effects, inter-specific transmission, transmission of antibiotic-resistant microbes, and transmission of viruses). We consider the implications of social microbial transmission for communicable and non-communicable diseases and evaluate the importance of a socially transmissible component underlying canonically non communicable diseases. The social transmission of mutualists and commensals may play a significant, under-appreciated role in the social determinants of health and may act as a hidden force in social evolution.

TI Isolation, bonding and reactivity of a monomeric stibine oxide
SO NATURE CHEMISTRY

DT Article
ID CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; ACID; TRIS(2,4,6-TRIISOPROPYLPHENYL)PHOSPHINE
AB In contrast to phosphine oxides and arsine oxides, which are common and exist as stable monomeric species featuring the corresponding pnictoryl functional group (Pn=O/Pn(+)-O-; Pn = P, As), stibine oxides are generally polymeric, and the properties of the unperturbed stiboryl group (Sb=O/Sb+-O-) remain unexplored. We now report the isolation of the monomeric stibine oxide, Dipp(3)SbO (where Dipp = 2,6-diisopropylphenyl). Spectroscopic, crystallographic and computational studies provide insight into the nature of the Sb=O/Sb+-O- bond. Moreover, isolation of Dipp(3)SbO allows the chemistry of the stiboryl group to be explored. Here we show that Dipp(3)SbO can act as a Bronsted base, a hydrogen-bond acceptor and a transition-metal ligand, in addition engaging in 1,2-addition, O-for-F-2 exchange and O-atom transfer. In all cases, the reactivity of Dipp(3)SbO differed from that of the lighter congeners Dipp(3)AsO and Dipp(3)PO.

AB Corrosion is a ubiquitous failure mode of materials. Often, the progression of localized corrosion is accompanied by the evolution of porosity in materials previously reported to be either three-dimensional or two-dimensional. However, using new tools and analysis techniques, we have realized that a more localized form of corrosion, which we call 1D wormhole corrosion, has previously been miscategorized in some situations. Using electron tomography, we show multiple examples of this 1D and percolating morphology. To understand the origin of this mechanism in a Ni-Cr alloy corroded by molten salt, we combined energy-filtered four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy and ab initio density functional theory calculations to develop a vacancy mapping method with nanometer-resolution, identifying a remarkably high vacancy concentration in the diffusion-induced grain boundary migration zone, up to 100 times the equilibrium value at the melting point. Deciphering the origins of 1D corrosion is an important step towards designing structural materials with enhanced corrosion resistance. Corrosion is a ubiquitous failure mode in materials. Here the authors report a percolating 1D wormhole corrosion morphology using advanced electron microscopy and theoretical simulations. The work presents a vacancy mapping method with nm-resolution, identifying the incubation sites of the wormholes.

AB Durable and conductive interfaces that enable chronic and high-resolution recording of neural activity are essential for understanding and treating neurodegenerative disorders. These chronic implants require long-term stability and small contact areas. Consequently, they are often coated with a blend of conductive polymers and are crosslinked to enhance durability despite the potentially deleterious effect of crosslinking on the mechanical and electrical properties. Here the grafting of the poly(3,4 ethylenedioxythiophene) scaffold, poly(styrenesulfonate)-b-poly(poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate block copolymer brush to gold, in a controlled and tunable manner, by surface-initiated atom-transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP) is described. This "block-brush" provides high volumetric capacitance (120 F cm & horbar;3), strong adhesion to the metal (4 h ultrasonication), improved surface hydrophilicity, and stability against 10 000 charge-discharge voltage sweeps on a multiarray neural electrode. In addition, the block-brush film showed 33% improved stability against current pulsing. This approach can open numerous avenues for exploring specialized polymer brushes for bioelectronics research and application.
   Creating durable, conductive interfaces is crucial for studying and treating brain disorders. Here a versatile method is described to graft a block copolymer from gold surfaces, enhancing stability without sacrificing electrical properties. This "block-brush" coating exhibits high capacitance, strong adhesion, and improved stability against voltage sweeps and current pulsing. This innovation holds promise for long-term neural stimulation and advances in bioelectronics research. image

AB To assist the translation of genetic findings to disease pathobiology and therapeutics discovery, we present an ensemble deep learning framework, termed PIONEER (Protein-protein InteractiOn iNtErfacE pRediction), that predicts protein-binding partner-specific interfaces for all known protein interactions in humans and seven other common model organisms to generate comprehensive structurally informed protein interactomes. We demonstrate that PIONEER outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods and experimentally validate its predictions. We show that disease-associated mutations are enriched in PIONEER-predicted protein-protein interfaces and explore their impact on disease prognosis and drug responses. We identify 586 significant protein-protein interactions (PPIs) enriched with PIONEER-predicted interface somatic mutations (termed oncoPPIs) from analysis of approximately 11,000 whole exomes across 33 cancer types and show significant associations of oncoPPIs with patient survival and drug responses. PIONEER, implemented as both a web server platform and a software package, identifies functional consequences of disease-associated alleles and offers a deep learning tool for precision medicine at multiscale interactome network levels.
   Protein-protein interactomes incorporating structural data predict the functional consequences of disease mutations.

AB Stars that formed with an initial mass of over 50 M-circle dot are very rare today, but they are thought to be more common in the early Universe. The fates of those early, metal-poor, massive stars are highly uncertain. Most are expected to directly collapse to black holes, while some may explode as a result of rotationally powered engines or the pair-creation instability. We present the chemical abundances of J0931+0038, a nearby low-mass star identified in early follow-up of the SDSS-V Milky Way Mapper, which preserves the signature of unusual nucleosynthesis from a massive star in the early Universe. J0931+0038 has a relatively high metallicity ([Fe/H] = -1.76 +/- 0.13) but an extreme odd-even abundance pattern, with some of the lowest known abundance ratios of [N/Fe], [Na/Fe], [K/Fe], [Sc/Fe], and [Ba/Fe]. The implication is that a majority of its metals originated in a single extremely metal-poor nucleosynthetic source. An extensive search through nucleosynthesis predictions finds a clear preference for progenitors with initial mass >50 M-circle dot, making J0931+0038 one of the first observational constraints on nucleosynthesis in this mass range. However, the full abundance pattern is not matched by any models in the literature. J0931+0038 thus presents a challenge for the next generation of nucleosynthesis models and motivates the study of high-mass progenitor stars impacted by convection, rotation, jets, and/or binary companions. Though rare, more examples of unusual early nucleosynthesis in metal-poor stars should be found in upcoming large spectroscopic surveys.

TI Convergent evolution of plant prickles by repeated gene co-option over
   deep time
SO SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID EGGPLANT; TRAIT; DNA; HOTSPOTS; PROGRAM; LOCI; RNA; L.
AB An enduring question in evolutionary biology concerns the degree to which episodes of convergent trait evolution depend on the same genetic programs, particularly over long timescales. In this work, we genetically dissected repeated origins and losses of prickles-sharp epidermal projections-that convergently evolved in numerous plant lineages. Mutations in a cytokinin hormone biosynthetic gene caused at least 16 independent losses of prickles in eggplants and wild relatives in the genus Solanum. Homologs underlie prickle formation across angiosperms that collectively diverged more than 150 million years ago, including rice and roses. By developing new Solanum genetic systems, we leveraged this discovery to eliminate prickles in a wild species and an indigenously foraged berry. Our findings implicate a shared hormone activation genetic program underlying evolutionarily widespread and recurrent instances of plant morphological innovation.

AB Perceptions of drinking water safety shape numerous health-related behaviors and attitudes, including water use and valuation, but they are not typically measured. We therefore characterize self-reported anticipated harm from drinking water in 141 countries using nationally representative survey data from the World Risk Poll (n = 148,585 individuals) and identify national- and individual-level predictors. We find that more than half (52.3%) of adults across sampled countries anticipate serious harm from drinking water in the next two years. The prevalence of self-reported anticipated harm is higher among women (relative to men), urban (relative to rural) residents, individuals with self-reported financial difficulties (relative to those getting by on their present income), and individuals with more years of education. In a country-level multivariable model, the percentage of the population reporting recent harm from drinking water, percentage of deaths attributable to unsafe water, and perceptions of public-sector corruption are associated with the prevalence of self-reported anticipated harm. Consideration of users' perspectives, particularly with respect to trust in the safety and governance of water services, is critical for promoting effective water resource management and ensuring the use, safety, and sustainability of water services.
   Perceptions of drinking water safety influence how people use and value water. Here, the authors find that 52.3% of adults across 141 countries self-report anticipating harm from drinking water.

AB Early life adversity predicts shorter adult lifespan in several animal taxa. Yet, work on long-lived primate populations suggests the evolution of mechanisms that contribute to resiliency and long lives despite early life insults. Here, we tested associations between individual and cumulative early life adversity and lifespan on rhesus macaques at the Cayo Santiago Biological Field Station using 50 years of demographic data. We performed sex-specific survival analyses at different life stages to contrast short-term effects of adversity (i.e., infant survival) with long-term effects (i.e., adult survival). Female infants showed vulnerability to multiple adversities at birth, but affected females who survived to adulthood experienced a reduced risk later in life. In contrast, male infants showed vulnerability to a lower number of adversities at birth, but those who survived to adulthood were negatively affected by both early life individual and cumulative adversity. Our study shows profound immediate effects of insults on female infant cohorts and suggests that affected female adults are more robust. In contrast, adult males who experienced harsh conditions early in life showed an increased mortality risk at older ages as expected from hypotheses within the life course perspective. Our analysis suggests sex-specific selection pressures on life histories and highlights the need for studies addressing the effects of early life adversity across multiple life stages.

TI Attention-Aware Resource Allocation and QoE Analysis for Metaverse

ID PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS; INCENTIVE MECHANISM; ANXIETY
AB Metaverse encapsulates our expectations of the next-generation Internet, while bringing new key performance indicators (KPIs). Although conventional ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC) can satisfy objective KPIs, it is difficult to provide a personalized immersive experience that is a distinctive feature of the Metaverse. Since the quality of experience (QoE) can be regarded as a comprehensive KPI, the URLLC is evolved towards the next generation URLLC (xURLLC) with a personalized resource allocation scheme to achieve higher QoE. To deploy Metaverse xURLLC services, we study the interaction between the Metaverse service provider (MSP) and the network infrastructure provider (InP), and provide an optimal contract design framework. Specifically, the utility of the MSP, defined as a function of Metaverse users' QoE, is to be maximized, while ensuring the incentives of the InP. To model the QoE mathematically, we propose a novel metric named Meta-Immersion that incorporates both the objective KPIs and subjective feelings of Metaverse users. Furthermore, we develop an attention-aware rendering capacity allocation scheme to improve QoE in xURLLC. Using a user-object-attention level dataset, we validate that the xURLLC can achieve an average of 20.1% QoE improvement compared to the conventional URLLC with a uniform resource allocation scheme. The code for this paper is available at https://github.com/HongyangDu/AttentionQoE.

AB This review aims at providing an extensive discussion of modern constraints relevant for dense and hot strongly interacting matter. It includes theoretical first-principle results from lattice and perturbative QCD, as well as chiral effective field theory results. From the experimental side, it includes heavy-ion collision and low-energy nuclear physics results, as well as observations from neutron stars and their mergers. The validity of different constraints, concerning specific conditions and ranges of applicability, is also provided.

AB While the conformational ensembles of disordered peptides and peptidomimetics are complex and challenging to characterize, they are a critical component in the paradigm connecting macromolecule sequence, structure, and function. In molecules that do not adopt a single predominant conformation, the conformational ensemble contains rich structural information that, if accessible, can provide a fundamental understanding related to desirable functions such as cell penetration of a therapeutic or the generation of tunable enzyme-mimetic architecture. To address the fundamental challenge of describing broad conformational ensembles, we developed a model system of peptidomimetics comprised of polar glycine and hydrophobic N-butylglycine to characterize using a suite of analytical techniques. Using replica exchange molecular dynamics atomistic simulations and liquid chromatography coupled to ion mobility spectrometry, we were able to distinguish the conformations of compositionally identical model sequences. However, differences between these model sequences were more challenging to resolve with characterization tools developed for intrinsically disordered proteins and polymers, including double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy and diffusion ordered spectroscopy (DOSY) NMR. Finally, we introduce a facile colorimetric assay using immobilized sequences that leverages a solvatochromic probe, Reichardt's dye, to visually reveal conformational trends consistent with the experimental and computational analysis. This rapid colorimetric technique provides a complementary method to characterize the disorder of macromolecules and examine conformational ensembles as an isolated or multiplexed technique.
   A model system of peptidomimetics was developed to characterize the complex conformational ensembles of compositionally identical disordered peptoids using a suite of analyses, including a rapid colorimetric technique.

AB We report a gravitational-wave parameter estimation algorithm, AMPLFI, based on likelihood-free inference using normalizing flows. The focus of AMPLFI is to perform real-time parameter estimation for candidates detected by machine-learning based compact binary coalescence search, Aframe. We present details of our algorithm and optimizations done related to data-loading and pre-processing on accelerated hardware. We train our model using binary black-hole (BBH) simulations on real LIGO-Virgo detector noise. Our model has similar to 6 million trainable parameters with training times less than or similar to 24 h. Based on online deployment on a mock data stream of LIGO-Virgo data, Aframe + AMPLFI is able to pick up BBH candidates and infer parameters for real-time alerts from data acquisition with a net latency of similar to 6 s.

AB The distribution of counterions and dopants within electrically doped semicrystalline conjugated polymers, such as poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT), plays a pivotal role in charge transport. The distribution of counterions in doped films of P3HT with controlled crystallinity was examined using polarized resonant soft X-ray scattering (P-RSoXS). The changes in scattering of doped P3HT films containing trifluoromethanesulfonimide (TFSI-) and 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ center dot-) as counterions to the charge carriers revealed distinct differences in their nanostructure. The scattering anisotropy of P-RSoXS from doped blends of P3HT was examined as a function of the soft X-ray absorption edge and found to vary systematically with the composition of crystalline and amorphous domains and by the identity of the counterion. A computational methodology was developed and used to simulate the soft X-ray scattering as a function of morphology and molecular orientation of the counterions. Modeling of the P-RSoXS at N and F K-edges was consistent with a structure where the conjugated plane of F4TCNQ center dot- aligns perpendicularly to that of the P3HT backbone in ordered domains. In contrast, TFSI- was distributed more uniformly between domains with no significant molecular alignment. The approach developed here demonstrates the capabilities of P-RSoXS in identifying orientation, structural, and compositional distributions within doped conjugated polymers using a computational workflow that is broadly extendable to other soft matter systems.

AB This White Paper presents an overview of the current status and future perspective of QCD research, based on the community inputs and scientific conclusions from the 2022 Hot and Cold QCD Town Meeting. We present the progress made in the last decade toward a deep understanding of both the fundamental structure of the sub-atomic matter of nucleon and nucleus in cold QCD, and the hot QCD matter in heavy ion collisions. We identify key questions of QCD research and plausible paths to obtaining answers to those questions in the near future, hence defining priorities of our research over the coming decades.

AB Hybrid quantum-classical approaches offer potential solutions to quantum chemistry problems, yet they often manifest as constrained optimization problems. Here, we explore the interconnection between constrained optimization and generalized eigenvalue problems through the Unitary Coupled Cluster (UCC) excitation generators. Inspired by the generator coordinate method, we employ these UCC excitation generators to construct non-orthogonal, overcomplete many-body bases, projecting the system Hamiltonian into an effective Hamiltonian, which bypasses issues such as barren plateaus that heuristic numerical minimizers often encountered in standard variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). Diverging from conventional quantum subspace expansion methods, we introduce an adaptive scheme that robustly constructs the many-body basis sets from a pool of the UCC excitation generators. This scheme supports the development of a hierarchical ADAPT quantum-classical strategy, enabling a balanced interplay between subspace expansion and ansatz optimization to address complex, strongly correlated quantum chemical systems cost-effectively, setting the stage for more advanced quantum simulations in chemistry.

AB Groundbreaking applications such as ChatGPT have heightened research interest in generative artificial intelligence (GAI). Essentially, GAI excels not only in content generation but also signal processing, offering support for wireless sensing. Hence, we introduce a novel GAI-assisted human flow detection system (G-HFD). Rigorously, G-HFD first uses the channel state information (CSI) to estimate the velocity and acceleration of propagation path length change of the human induced reflection (HIR). Then, given the strong inference ability of the diffusion model, we propose a unified weighted conditional diffusion model (UW-CDM) to denoise the estimation results, enabling detection of the number of targets. Next, we use the CSI obtained by a uniform linear array with wavelength spacing to estimate the HIR's time of flight and direction of arrival (DoA). In this process, UW-CDM solves the problem of ambiguous DoA spectrum, ensuring accurate DoA estimation. Finally, through clustering, G-HFD determines the number of subflows and the number of targets in each subflow, i.e., the subflow size. The evaluation based on practical downlink communication signals shows G-HFD's accuracy of subflow size detection can reach 91%. This validates its effectiveness and underscores the significant potential of GAI in the context of wireless sensing.

AB GRB 230812B is a bright and relatively nearby (z = 0.36) long gamma-ray burst (GRB) that has generated significant interest in the community and has thus been observed over the entire electromagnetic spectrum. We report over 80 observations in X-ray, ultraviolet, optical, infrared, and submillimetre bands from the GRANDMA (Global Rapid Advanced Network for Multimessenger Addicts) network of observatories and from observational partners. Adding complementary data from the literature, we then derive essential physical parameters associated with the ejecta and external properties (i.e. the geometry and environment) of the GRB and compare with other analyses of this event. We spectroscopically confirm the presence of an associated supernova, SN2023pel, and we derive a photospheric expansion velocity of v similar to 17 x 10(3) km s(-1). We analyse the photometric data first using empirical fits of the flux and then with full Bayesian inference. We again strongly establish the presence of a supernova in the data, with a maximum (pseudo-)bolometric luminosity of 5.75 x 10(42) erg s(-1), at 15.76(-1.21)(+0.81) days (in the observer frame) after the trigger, with a half-max time width of 22.0 days. We compare these values with those of SN1998bw, SN2006aj, and SN2013dx. Our best-fit model favours a very low density environment (log(10)(n(ISM)/cm(-3))=-2.38(-1.60)(+1.45)) and small values for the jet's core angle theta(core)=1.54(-0.81)(+1.02) deg and viewing angle theta(obs)=0.76(-0.76)(+1.29) deg. GRB 230812B is thus one of the best observed afterglows with a distinctive supernova bump.

FX This work has been coordinated with Mansi Kasliwal and Brad Cenko's
   group, with whom we shared common developments and visions for
   time-domain astronomy tools and methods (e.g. skyportal). We thank Gokul
   Prem Srinivasaragavan in particular for fruitful exchanges on this
   object. We also thank the anonymous reviewer for constructive comments
   that have helped improve the paper.The GRANDMA collaboration thanks its
   entire network of observatories/observers, all its partners in
   observations and analyses, and the amateur participants of its
   Kilonova-Catcher (KNC) programme.We dedicate this work to D. A. Kann,
   whose groundbreaking work in the field of GRBs earned him international
   recognition over the past two decades. Alex, your contributions to the
   world of GRB science will always be remembered. We deeply miss you and
   hope you are proud of the way the GRB community carries on your
   legacy.This research has also made use of the MISTRAL data base, based
   on observations made at Observatoire de Haute Provence (CNRS), France,
   with the MISTRAL spectro-imager, and operated at CeSAM (LAM), Marseille,
   France. The GRB OHP observing team is particularly grateful to Jerome
   Schmitt for the major role he has played in the development and
   operations of the MISTRAL instrument at the T193 telescope. GRANDMA
   thanks amateur astronomers for their observations: MS, KF, SL, JN, MF,
   MO. This work is based on observations carried out under project number
   S23BG with the IRAM NOEMA interferometer. Partly based on observations
   made with the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC), installed at the Spanish
   Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos of the Instituto de Astrofisica
   de Canarias, on the island of La Palma. Partly based on observations
   made with the Nordic Optical Telescope, owned in collaboration by the
   University of Turku and Aarhus University, and operated jointly by
   Aarhus University, the University of Turku, and the University of Oslo,

AB Lack of rigorous reproducibility and validation are significant hurdles for scientific development across many fields. Materials science, in particular, encompasses a variety of experimental and theoretical approaches that require careful benchmarking. Leaderboard efforts have been developed previously to mitigate these issues. However, a comprehensive comparison and benchmarking on an integrated platform with multiple data modalities with perfect and defect materials data is still lacking. This work introduces JARVIS-Leaderboard, an open-source and community-driven platform that facilitates benchmarking and enhances reproducibility. The platform allows users to set up benchmarks with custom tasks and enables contributions in the form of dataset, code, and meta-data submissions. We cover the following materials design categories: Artificial Intelligence (AI), Electronic Structure (ES), Force-fields (FF), Quantum Computation (QC), and Experiments (EXP). For AI, we cover several types of input data, including atomic structures, atomistic images, spectra, and text. For ES, we consider multiple ES approaches, software packages, pseudopotentials, materials, and properties, comparing results to experiment. For FF, we compare multiple approaches for material property predictions. For QC, we benchmark Hamiltonian simulations using various quantum algorithms and circuits. Finally, for experiments, we use the inter-laboratory approach to establish benchmarks. There are 1281 contributions to 274 benchmarks using 152 methods with more than 8 million data points, and the leaderboard is continuously expanding. The JARVIS-Leaderboard is available at the website: https://pages.nist.gov/jarvis_leaderboard/

AB We investigate the spectroscopic properties of 85 brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) and their companions observed with the SDSS MaNGA integral field unit. Galaxy redshifts are between 0.08 < z < 0.15, allowing for a field-of-view up to 80 x 80 kpc. For the main galaxies: the average age of the BCG cores is 7.66 +/- 1.36 Gyr with no significant gradient out to 2 R-e; the average metallicity of the BCG cores is [Z/H]=0.23 +/- 0.03 with a negative gradient of Delta[Z/H]/Delta(R/R-e) = -0.14 +/- 0.09 which flattens beyond 1.2 R-e. Velocity dispersion gradients are mostly flat, but a few positive slopes are seen in the most massive galaxies. Emission lines are present in 12 of the BCGs, most often confined to the central similar to 2 kpc with emission line ratios well-described by a LINER or AGN excitation source. There are 78 companion galaxies identified and 9 have nebular emission lines that indicate recent star formation. The companions with flux ratios of 4:1 and 20:1 within 30 kpc of their BCG's core are studied. The companion galaxies have a median age of 7.65 +/- 1.55 Gyr and are high-metallicity systems, with a median [Z/H] = 0.17 +/- 0.07. Close spectroscopic companions with higher merging probabilities have an average merging time of 0.5 +/- 0.2 Gyr. The average merger rate is 0.08 +/- 0.12 Gyr(-1) for 4:1 companions and 0.26 +/- 0.22 Gyr(-1) for 20:1 companions, allowing for an increase in mass of 2.3 +/- 3.4 per cent Gyr(-1) and 3.5 +/- 3.2 per cent Gyr(-1), respectively.

Curiosity is tied to the anticipation of minimizing prediction errors through future, novel information, whereas creative AHA moments are connected to the actual minimization of prediction errors through current, novel information.

TI Pushing the frontiers in climate modelling and analysis with machine
   learning
SO NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE
LA English
DT Review; Early Access
ID BLACK-BOX; INFERENCE
AB Climate modelling and analysis are facing new demands to enhance projections and climate information. Here we argue that now is the time to push the frontiers of machine learning beyond state-of-the-art approaches, not only by developing machine-learning-based Earth system models with greater fidelity, but also by providing new capabilities through emulators for extreme event projections with large ensembles, enhanced detection and attribution methods for extreme events, and advanced climate model analysis and benchmarking. Utilizing this potential requires key machine learning challenges to be addressed, in particular generalization, uncertainty quantification, explainable artificial intelligence and causality. This interdisciplinary effort requires bringing together machine learning and climate scientists, while also leveraging the private sector, to accelerate progress towards actionable climate science.
   Machine learning methods allow for advances in many aspects of climate research. In this Perspective, the authors give an overview of recent progress and remaining challenges to harvest the full potential of machine learning methods.

AB There is an urgent need for models that can robustly detect past and project future ecosystem changes and risks to the services that they provide to people. The Fisheries and Marine Ecosystem Model Intercomparison Project (FishMIP) was established to develop model ensembles for projecting long-term impacts of climate change on fisheries and marine ecosystems while informing policy at spatio-temporal scales relevant to the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP) framework. While contributing FishMIP models have improved over time, large uncertainties in projections remain, particularly in coastal and shelf seas where most of the world's fisheries occur. Furthermore, previous FishMIP climate impact projections have been limited by a lack of global standardized historical fishing data, low resolution of coastal processes, and uneven capabilities across the FishMIP community to dynamically model fisheries. These features are needed to evaluate how reliably the FishMIP ensemble captures past ecosystem states - a crucial step for building confidence in future projections. To address these issues, we have developed FishMIP 2.0 comprising a two-track framework for: (a) Model evaluation and attribution of past changes and (b) future climate and socioeconomic scenario projections. Key advances include improved historical climate forcing, which captures oceanographic features not previously resolved, and standardized global fishing forcing to test fishing effects systematically across models. FishMIP 2.0 is a crucial step toward a detection and attribution framework for changing marine ecosystems and toward enhanced policy relevance through increased confidence in future ensemble projections. Our results will help elucidate pathways toward achieving sustainable development goals.

AB The ultrafaint dwarf galaxy Reticulum II was enriched by a single rare and prolific r-process event. The r-process content of Reticulum II thus provides a unique opportunity to study metal mixing in a relic first galaxy. Using multi-object high-resolution spectroscopy with VLT/GIRAFFE and Magellan/M2FS, we identify 32 clear spectroscopic member stars and measure abundances of Mg, Ca, Fe, and Ba where possible. We find 72-(+10)(12)% of the 10 -stars are r-process-enhanced, with a mean ([Ba / H]) =-1.68 + 0.07 and unresolved intrinsic dispersion sigma([Ba/H])< 0.20. The homogeneous r-process abundances imply that Ret II's metals are well mixed by the time the r- enhanced stars form, which simulations have shown requires at least 100 Myr of metal mixing in between bursts of star formation to homogenize. This is the first direct evidence of bursty star formation in an ultrafaint dwarf galaxy. The homogeneous dilution prefers a prompt and high-yield r-process site, such as collapsar disk winds or prompt neutron star mergers. We also find evidence from [Ba/H] and [Mg/Ca] that the r-enhanced stars in Ret II formed in the absence of substantial pristine gas accretion, perhaps indicating that asymptotic to 70% of Ret II stars formed after reionization.

AB We report the properties of primary cosmic-ray sulfur (S) in the rigidity range 2.15 GV to 3.0 TV based on 0.38 x 106 sulfur nuclei collected by the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer experiment (AMS). We observed that above 90 GV the rigidity dependence of the S flux is identical to the rigidity dependence of Ne-Mg-Si fluxes, which is different from the rigidity dependence of the He-C-O-Fe fluxes. We found that, similar to N, Na, and Al cosmic rays, over the entire rigidity range, the traditional primary cosmic rays S, Ne, Mg, and C all have sizeable secondary components, and the S, Ne, and Mg fluxes are well described by the weighted sum of the primary silicon flux and the secondary fluorine flux, and the C flux is well described by the weighted sum of the primary oxygen flux and the secondary boron flux. The primary and secondary contributions of the traditional primary cosmic-ray fluxes of C, Ne, Mg, and S (even Z elements) are distinctly different from the primary and secondary contributions of the N, Na, and Al (odd Z elements) fluxes. The abundance ratio at the source for S/Si is 0.167 & PLUSMN; 0.006, for Ne/Si is 0.833 & PLUSMN; 0.025, for Mg/Si is 0.994 & PLUSMN; 0.029, and for C/O is 0.836 & PLUSMN; 0.025. These values are determined independent of cosmic-ray propagation.

AB Plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) have played a significant role in the evolution of modern nanoscience and nanotechnology in terms of colloidal synthesis, general understanding of nanocrystal growth mechanisms, and their impact in a wide range of applications. They exhibit strong visible colors due to localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) that depends on their size, shape, composition, and the surrounding dielectric environment. Under resonant excitation, the LSPR of plasmonic NPs leads to a strong field enhancement near their surfaces and thus enhances various light-matter interactions. These unique optical properties of plasmonic NPs have been used to design chemical and biological sensors. Over the last few decades, colloidal plasmonic NPs have been greatly exploited in sensing applications through LSPR shifts (colorimetry), surface-enhanced Raman scattering, surface-enhanced fluorescence, and chiroptical activity. Although colloidal plasmonic NPs have emerged at the forefront of nanobiosensors, there are still several important challenges to be addressed for the realization of plasmonic NP-based sensor kits for routine use in daily life. In this comprehensive review, researchers of different disciplines (colloidal and analytical chemistry, biology, physics, and medicine) have joined together to summarize the past, present, and future of plasmonic NP-based sensors in terms of different sensing platforms, understanding of the sensing mechanisms, different chemical and biological analytes, and the expected future technologies. This review is expected to guide the researchers currently working in this field and inspire future generations of scientists to join this compelling research field and its branches.
   This comprehensive review summarizes the past, present, and future of plasmonic NP-based sensors in terms of different sensing platforms, different chemical and biological analytes, and the expected future technologies.

AB In a p-n junction, the separation of positive and negative charges leads to diode transport, in which charge flows in only one direction. Non-centrosymmetric polar conductors are intrinsic diodes that could be of use in the development of nonlinear applications. Such systems have recently been extended to non-centrosymmetric superconductors, and the superconducting diode effect has been observed. Here, we report an antiferromagnetic diode effect in a centrosymmetric crystal without directional charge separation. We observed large second-harmonic transport in a nonlinear electronic device enabled by the compensated antiferromagnetic state of even-layered MnBi2Te4. We show that this antiferromagnetic diode effect can be used to create in-plane field-effect transistors and microwave-energy-harvesting devices. We also show that electrical sum-frequency generation can be used as a tool to detect nonlinear responses in quantum materials.

AB The dominant paradigm of experiments in the social and behavioral sciences views an experiment as a test of a theory, where the theory is assumed to generalize beyond the experiment's specific conditions. According to this view, which Alan Newell once characterized as "playing twenty questions with nature," theory is advanced one experiment at a time, and the integration of disparate findings is assumed to happen via the scientific publishing process. In this article, we argue that the process of integration is at best inefficient, and at worst it does not, in fact, occur. We further show that the challenge of integration cannot be adequately addressed by recently proposed reforms that focus on the reliability and replicability of individual findings, nor simply by conducting more or larger experiments. Rather, the problem arises from the imprecise nature of social and behavioral theories and, consequently, a lack of commensurability across experiments conducted under different conditions. Therefore, researchers must fundamentally rethink how they design experiments and how the experiments relate to theory. We specifically describe an alternative framework, integrative experiment design, which intrinsically promotes commensurability and continuous integration of knowledge. In this paradigm, researchers explicitly map the design space of possible experiments associated with a given research question, embracing many potentially relevant theories rather than focusing on just one. Researchers then iteratively generate theories and test them with experiments explicitly sampled from the design space, allowing results to be integrated across experiments. Given recent methodological and technological developments, we conclude that this approach is feasible and would generate more-reliable, more-cumulative empirical and theoretical knowledge than the current paradigm - and with far greater efficiency.

AB Magnetic materials with noncollinear spin textures arepromisingfor spintronic applications. To realize practical devices, controlover the length and energy scales of such spin textures is imperative.The chiral helimagnets Cr1/3NbS2 and Cr1/3TaS2 exhibit analogous magnetic-phase diagramswith different real-space periodicities and field dependence, positioningthem as model systems for studying the relative strengths of the microscopicmechanisms giving rise to exotic spin textures. Although the electronicstructure of the Nb analogue has been experimentally investigated,the Ta analogue has received far less attention. Here, we presenta comprehensive suite of electronic structure studies on both Cr1/3NbS2 and Cr1/3TaS2 usingangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory.We show that bands in Cr1/3TaS2 are more dispersivethan their counterparts in Cr1/3NbS2, resultingin markedly different Fermi wavevectors. The fact that their qualitativemagnetic phase diagrams are nevertheless identical shows that hybridizationbetween the intercalant and host lattice mediates the magnetic exchangeinteractions in both of these materials. We ultimately find that ferromagneticcoupling is stronger in Cr1/3TaS2, but largerspin-orbit coupling (and a stronger Dzyaloshinskii-Moriyainteraction) from the heavier host lattice ultimately gives rise toshorter spin textures.

AB Developments in computational omics technologies have provided new means to access the hidden diversity of natural products, unearthing new potential for drug discovery. In parallel, artificial intelligence approaches such as machine learning have led to exciting developments in the computational drug design field, facilitating biological activity prediction and de novo drug design for molecular targets of interest. Here, we describe current and future synergies between these developments to effectively identify drug candidates from the plethora of molecules produced by nature. We also discuss how to address key challenges in realizing the potential of these synergies, such as the need for high-quality datasets to train deep learning algorithms and appropriate strategies for algorithm validation.
   Advances in computational omics technologies are enabling access to the hidden diversity of natural products, and artificial intelligence approaches are facilitating key steps in harnessing the therapeutic potential of such compounds, including biological activity prediction. This article discusses synergies between these fields to effectively identify drug candidates from the plethora of molecules produced by nature, and how to address the challenges in realizing the potential of these synergies.

TI CACHE Challenge #1: Targeting the WDR Domain of LRRK2, A Parkinson's
   Disease Associated Protein
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING
LA English
DT Article
AB The CACHE challenges are a series of prospective benchmarking exercises to evaluate progress in the field of computational hit-finding. Here we report the results of the inaugural CACHE challenge in which 23 computational teams each selected up to 100 commercially available compounds that they predicted would bind to the WDR domain of the Parkinson's disease target LRRK2, a domain with no known ligand and only an apo structure in the PDB. The lack of known binding data and presumably low druggability of the target is a challenge to computational hit finding methods. Of the 1955 molecules predicted by participants in Round 1 of the challenge, 73 were found to bind to LRRK2 in an SPR assay with a K-D lower than 150 mu M. These 73 molecules were advanced to the Round 2 hit expansion phase, where computational teams each selected up to 50 analogs. Binding was observed in two orthogonal assays for seven chemically diverse series, with affinities ranging from 18 to 140 mu M. The seven successful computational workflows varied in their screening strategies and techniques. Three used molecular dynamics to produce a conformational ensemble of the targeted site, three included a fragment docking step, three implemented a generative design strategy and five used one or more deep learning steps. CACHE #1 reflects a highly exploratory phase in computational drug design where participants adopted strikingly diverging screening strategies. Machine learning-accelerated methods achieved similar results to brute force (e.g., exhaustive) docking. First-in-class, experimentally confirmed compounds were rare and weakly potent, indicating that recent advances are not sufficient to effectively address challenging targets.

AB Precision measurements by the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) on the International Space Station of the deuteron (D) flux are presented. The measurements are based on 21 x 10(6) D nuclei in the rigidity range from 1.9 to 21 GV collected from May 2011 to April 2021. We observe that over the entire rigidity range the D flux exhibits nearly identical time variations with the p, He-3, and He-4 fluxes. Above 4.5 GV, the D/He-4 flux ratio is time independent and its rigidity dependence is well described by a single power law proportional to R-Delta with Delta(D/4He) = -0.108 +/- 0.005. This is in contrast with the He-3/He-4 flux ratio for which we find Delta(3He/4He) = -0.289 +/- 0.003. Above similar to 13 GV we find a nearly identical rigidity dependence of the D and p fluxes with a D/p flux ratio of 0.027 +/- 0.001. These unexpected observations indicate that cosmic deuterons have a sizable primarylike component. With a method independent of cosmic ray propagation, we obtain the primary component of the D flux equal to 9.4 +/- 0.5% of the He-4 flux and the secondary component of the D flux equal to 58 +/- 5% of the He-3 flux.

AB Missions into Deep Space are planned this decade. Yet the health consequences of exposure to microgravity and galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) over years-long missions on indispensable visceral organs such as the kidney are largely unexplored. We performed biomolecular (epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, epiproteomic, metabolomic, metagenomic), clinical chemistry (electrolytes, endocrinology, biochemistry) and morphometry (histology, 3D imaging, miRNA-ISH, tissue weights) analyses using samples and datasets available from 11 spaceflight-exposedmouse and 5 human, 1 simulated microgravity rat and 4 simulated GCR-exposedmouse missions. We found that spaceflight induces: 1) renal transporter dephosphorylation which may indicate astronauts' increased risk of nephrolithiasis is in part a primary renal phenomenon rather than solely a secondary consequence of bone loss; 2) remodelling of the nephron that results in expansion of distal convoluted tubule size but loss of overall tubule density; 3) renal damage and dysfunction when exposed to a Mars roundtrip dose-equivalent of simulated GCR.

AB Humans rely increasingly on sensors to address grand challenges and to improve quality of life in the era of digitalization and big data. For ubiquitous sensing, flexible sensors are developed to overcome the limitations of conventional rigid counterparts. Despite rapid advancement in bench-side research over the last decade, the market adoption of flexible sensors remains limited. To ease and to expedite their deployment, here, we identify bottlenecks hindering the maturation of flexible sensors and propose promising solutions. We first analyze continued...challenges in achieving satisfactory sensing performance for real-world applications and then summarize issues in compatible sensor-biology interfaces, followed by brief discussions on powering and connecting sensor networks. Issues en route to commercialization and for sustainable growth of the sector are also analyzed, highlighting environmental concerns and emphasizing nontechnical issues such as business, regulatory, and ethical considerations. Additionally, we look at future intelligent flexible sensors. In proposing a comprehensive roadmap, we hope to steer research efforts towards common goals and to guide coordinated development strategies from disparate communities. Through such collaborative
