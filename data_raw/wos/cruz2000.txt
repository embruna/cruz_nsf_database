TI Nanoscale Manipulation of Single-Molecule Conformational Transition

AB Controlling molecular actions on demand is a critical step toward developing single-molecule functional devices. Such control can be achieved by manipulating the interactions between individual molecules and their nanoscale environment. In this study, we demonstrate the conformational transition of a single pyrrolidine molecule adsorbed on a Cu(100) surface, driven by vibrational excitation through tunneling electrons using scanning tunneling microscopy. We identify multiple transition pathways between two structural states, each governed by distinct vibrational modes. The nuclear motions corresponding to these modes are elucidated through density functional theory calculations. By leveraging fundamental forces, including van der Waals interactions, dipole-dipole interactions, and steric hindrance, we precisely tune the molecule-environment coupling. This tuning enables the modulation of vibrational energies, adjustment of transition probabilities, and selection of the lowest-energy transition pathway. Our findings highlight how tunable force fields in a nanoscale cavity can govern molecular conformational transitions, providing a pathway to engineer molecule-environment interactions for targeted molecular functionalities.

AB Polarizability (alpha) is a fundamental property which measures the tendency of the electron cloud of an atom, ion, or molecule to be distorted by electric field. Polarizability contributes to important physical properties such as molecular interactions or dielectric constants; thus, it is essential to have accurate polarizabilities in molecular simulations. However, it remains a challenge to develop polarizable force fields (FFs) for ions in computational chemistry. In particular, a comprehensive set of polarizabilities for ions has not been derived. Herein, we derived a systematic set of polarizabilities for atoms and ions across the periodic table based on high-level quantum mechanics calculations. These values have excellent agreement with experimental data. Furthermore, we examined the relationship between the obtained polarizabilities and the van der Waals (VDW) radii (R-VDW) that we previously determined (J. Chem. Theory Comput., 2023, 19, 2064). Two relationships, R-VDW proportional to alpha(1/7) and R-VDW proportional to alpha(1/3), proposed in previous studies were examined in the present work. Our results indicated the former relationship, which was derived based on the quantum harmonic oscillator model, prevails for atoms and cations, but neither relationship provides a satisfactory fit for anions. This is consistent with the tight-binding nature of the electrons in atoms and cations, while it is more challenging to quantify the polarizabilities of anions because of their more dispersed electron clouds. Moreover, we compared different approaches to determine the dispersion coefficients, including the London equation, Slater-Kirkwood equation, symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) calculations, and time-dependent density functional theory method, along with the approach based on VDW constants. Our results indicated that although different approaches predict deviated magnitudes for the dispersion coefficients, their predictions are highly correlated, implying that each of these approaches can be used to evaluate dispersion interactions after proper scaling. Finally, we have developed a parametrization strategy for the 12-6-4 model based on the obtained insights. We specifically compared the performance of the 12-6-4 model with SAPT and SobEDA analyses to model interactions involving Na+/Mg2+ and various ligands containing He, Ne, Ar, H2O, NH3, [H2PO4](-), and [HPO4](2-). Our results demonstrate that the 12-6-4 parameters effectively reproduce both the total interaction energy and the individual energy components (electrostatics, exchange-repulsion, dispersion, and induction), highlighting the physical robustness of the 12-6-4 model and the effectiveness of our parametrization approach. This study has significant implications for advancing the development of next-generation ion models and polarizable FFs.

AB The incorporation of noncanonical amino acids into proteins and protein-based materials has significantly expanded the repertoire of available protein structures and chemistries. Through residue-specific incorporation, protein properties can be globally modified, resulting in the creation of novel proteins and materials with diverse and tailored characteristics. In this review, we highlight recent advancements in residue-specific incorporation techniques as well as the applications of the engineered proteins and materials. Specifically, we discuss their utility in bio-orthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT), fluorescent noncanonical amino acid tagging (FUNCAT), threonine-derived noncanonical amino acid tagging (THRONCAT), cross-linking, fluorination, and enzyme engineering. This review underscores the importance of noncanonical amino acid incorporation as a tool for the development of tailored protein properties to meet diverse research and industrial needs.

AB Fostering creative minds has always been a premise to ensure adaptation to new challenges of human civilization. While some alternative educational settings (i.e., Montessori) were shown to nurture creative skills, it is unknown how they impact underlying brain mechanisms across the school years. This study assessed creative thinking and resting-state functional connectivity via fMRI in 75 children (4-18 y.o.) enrolled either in Montessori or traditional schools. We found that pedagogy significantly influenced creative performance and underlying brain networks. Replicating past work, Montessori-schooled children showed higher scores on creative thinking tests. Using static functional connectivity analysis, we found that Montessori-schooled children showed decreased within-network functional connectivity of the salience network. Moreover, using dynamic functional connectivity, we found that traditionally-schooled children spent more time in a brain state characterized by high intra-default mode network connectivity. These findings suggest that pedagogy may influence brain networks relevant to creative thinking-particularly the default and salience networks. Further research is needed, like a longitudinal study, to verify these results given the implications for educational practitioners. Research HighlightsMost executive jobs are prospected to be obsolete within several decades, so creative skills are seen as essential for the near future.School experience has been shown to play a role in creativity development, however, the underlying brain mechanisms remained under-investigated yet.Seventy-five 4-18 years-old children, from Montessori or traditional schools, performed a creativity task at the behavioral level, and a 6-min resting-state MR scan.We uniquely report preliminary evidence for the impact of pedagogy on functional brain networks.

AB Rafflesiaceae is a family of endangered plants whose members are solely parasitic to the tropical grape vine Tetrastigma (Vitaceae). Currently, the genetics of their crosstalk with the host remains unexplored. In this study, we use homology-based in silico approaches to characterize micro-RNAs (miRNAs) expressed by Sapria himalayana and Rafflesia cantleyi from published omics data. Derived from secondary structures or hairpins, miRNAs are small regulators of gene expression. We found that some plant-conserved miRNA still exists in Rafflesiaceae. Out of 9 highly conserved miRNA families in plants, 7 families (156/157, 159/319, 160, 165/166, 171, 172, 390) were identified with a total of 22 variants across Rafflesiaceae. Some miRNAs were missing endogenous targets and may have evolved to target host miRNA, though this requires experimental verification. Rafflesiaceae miRNA promoters are mostly inducible by ethylene that mediates stress response in the host but could be perceived by the parasites as a signal for growth. This study provides evidence that certain miRNAs with ancient origins in land plants still exist in Rafflesiaceae, though some may have been coopted by parasites to target host genes.

AB We provide a rearrangement based algorithm for detection of subgraphs of k vertices with long escape times for directed or undirected networks that is not combinatorially complex to compute. Complementing other notions of densest subgraphs and graph cuts, our method is based on the mean hitting time required for a random walker to leave a designated set and hit the complement. We provide a new relaxation of this notion of hitting time on a given subgraph and use that relaxation to construct a subgraph detection algorithm that can be computed easily and a generalization to K -partitioning schemes. Using a modification of the subgraph detector on each component, we propose a graph partitioner that identifies regions where random walks live for comparably large times. Importantly, our method implicitly respects the directed nature of the data for directed graphs while also being applicable to undirected graphs. We apply the partitioning method for community detection to a large class of models and real -world data sets.

AB Horned beetles have emerged as a powerful study system with which to investigate the developmental mechanisms underlying environment-responsive development and its evolution. We begin by reviewing key advances in our understanding of the diverse roles played by transcription factors, endocrine regulators, and signal transduction pathways in the regulation of horned beetle plasticity. We then explore recent efforts aimed at understanding how such condition-specific expression may be regulated in the first place, as well as how the differential expression of master regulators may instruct conditional expression of downstream target genes. Here, we focus on the significance of chromatin remodeling as a powerful but thus far understudied mechanism able to facilitate trait-, sex-, and species-specific responses to environmental conditions.

AB In this paper, a cost-effective and high-accuracy precoding technique based on $\epsilon $ -Fuzzy pareto active learning (FPAL) is proposed for millimeter wave (mmWave) massive MIMO communications. The proposed method achieves a low iteration convergence with low complexity. Two practical structures, namely fully-connected and partially-connected structures are considered for hybrid precoding. Furthermore, the effect of high and low-resolution quantization in the digital-to-analog converter, phase shifter, and imperfect channel state information are discussed. The performance results of the proposed technique and alternating minimization methods beside fully digital techniques are compared and discussed in the terms of the spectral efficiency (SE), bit error rate (BER), normalized mean square error (NMSE), energy efficiency (EE) for phase-shifter (PS) with low bit quantization, and imperfect channel state information (CSI). To address the applicability of the proposed method, experimental results are obtained from a real mmWave hardware setup compliant with 3GPP standards, and verify the simulated ones for the proposed e -FPAL hybrid precoding scheme. The reduced complexity, higher performance and EE make the proposed method suitable for 5G and beyond communication systems.

AB The evaluation of Fock exchange is often the computationally most expensive part of hybrid functional density functional theory calculations in a systematically improvable, complete basis. In this work, we employ a Tucker tensor based approach that substantially accelerates the evaluation of the action of Fock exchange by transforming three-dimensional convolutional integrals into a tensor product of one-dimensional convolution integrals. Our numerical implementation uses a parallelization strategy that balances the memory and communication bottlenecks, alongside overlapping compute and communication operations to enhance computational efficiency and parallel scalability. The accuracy and computational efficiency are demonstrated on various systems, including Pt clusters of various sizes and a TiO2 cluster with 3684 electrons.

AB As the field of quantum computing rapidly advances, there is a growing demand for skilled professionals adept in quantum computing and programming. Recognizing this need, in this paper, we share our experiences teaching an introductory-level quantum computing course to students at Cleveland State University (CSU). The course integrates dedicated hands-on programming labs, allowing students to verify their experimental results with corresponding examples from the textbook. These labs cover a diverse range of topics, including fundamental elements such as quantum gates and circuits, quantum key distribution protocols, and quantum algorithms. As educators, our goal is to share teaching insights and resources with fellow instructors in the field. This article elucidates the rationale behind the design of each experiment, providing a deeper understanding of quantum computing.

AB We present a novel numerical algorithm to perform nonlinear topology optimization on elastic thin shells. The main component of our method is a differentiable thin-shell simulator based on discrete differential geometry (DDG) discretization and the projected Newton method to solve geometrically nonlinear elasticity and its derivatives on a triangle mesh. We build a density-based topology optimization algorithm, enhanced by a density filter and a Heaviside projection scheme, to emerge and optimize topologically complex shell structures on curved surfaces. We validate our approach using standard test cases for nonlinear topology optimization and demonstrate the efficacy of our method by tackling highly nonlinear topology optimization problems by producing complex and high -resolution shell structural designs under various load conditions.

AB Photonic crystals-a class of materials whose optical properties derive from their structure in addition to their composition-can be created by self-assembling particles whose sizes are comparable to the wavelengths of visible light. Proof-of-principle studies have shown that DNA can be used to guide the self-assembly of micrometer-sized colloidal particles into fully programmable crystal structures with photonic properties in the visible spectrum. However, the extremely temperature-sensitive kinetics of micrometer-sized DNA-functionalized particles has frustrated attempts to grow large, monodisperse crystals that are required for photonic metamaterial applications. Here we describe a robust two-step protocol for self-assembling single-domain crystals that contain millions of optical-scale DNA-functionalized particles: Monodisperse crystals are initially assembled in monodisperse droplets made by microfluidics, after which they are grown to macroscopic dimensions via seeded diffusion-limited growth. We demonstrate the generality of our approach by assembling different macroscopic single-domain photonic crystals with metamaterial properties, like structural coloration, that depend on the underlying crystal structure. By circumventing the fundamental kinetic traps intrinsic to crystallization of optical-scale DNA-coated colloids, we eliminate a key barrier to engineering photonic devices from DNA-programmed materials.
   DNA-programmed colloidal assembly of macroscopic crystals for photonic applications remains elusive. Here, the authors use insights from studies of nucleation and seeded growth to develop a two-step method for assembling macroscopic photonic crystals.

AB Plants rely on innate immune systems to defend against a wide variety of biotic attackers. Key components of innate immunity include cell-surface pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), which recognize pest- and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Unlike other classes of receptors that often have visible cell-death immune outputs upon activation, PRRs generally lack rapid methods for assessing function. Here, we describe a genetically encoded bioluminescent reporter of immune activation by heterologously expressed PRRs in the model organism Nicotiana benthamiana. We characterized N. benthamiana transcriptome changes in response to Agrobacterium tumefaciens and subsequent PAMP treatment to identify pattern-triggered immunity (PTI)-associated marker genes, which were then used to generate promoter-luciferase fusion fungal bioluminescence pathway (FBP) constructs. A reporter construct termed pFBP_2xNbLYS1::LUZ allows for robust detection of PTI activation by heterologously expressed PRRs. Consistent with known PTI signaling pathways, reporter activation by receptor-like protein (RLP) PRRs is dependent on the known adaptor of RLP PRRs, i.e., SOBIR1. The FBP reporter minimizes the amount of labor, reagents, and time needed to assay function of PRRs and displays robust sensitivity at biologically relevant PAMP concentrations, making it ideal for high throughput screens. The tools described in this paper will be powerful for investigations of PRR function and characterization of the structure-function of plant cell-surface receptors.

AB Traditional approaches to undergraduate-level quantum mechanics require extensive mathematical preparation, preventing most students from enrolling in a quantum mechanics course until the third year of a physics major. Here we describe an approach to teaching quantum formalism and postulates that can be used with first-year undergraduate students and even high school students. The only pre-requisite is a familiarity with vector dot products. This approach enables students to learn Dirac notation and core postulates of quantum mechanics at a much earlier stage in their academic career, which can help students prepare for careers in quantum science and engineering and advance the Second Quantum Revolution.

AB The characterization of algae biomass is essential for ensuring the health of an aquatic ecosystem. Algae over-growth can be detrimental to the chemical composition of a habitat and affect the availability of safe drinking water. In-situ sensors are commonplace in ocean and water quality monitoring scenarios where the collection of field data using readily deployable, cost-effective sensors is required. For this purpose, the use of compact time domain nuclear magnetic resonance (TD-NMR) is proposed for the assessment of magnetic particle (MP) content in algae. A custom NMR system capable of rapidly acquiring relaxometric data is introduced, and the T-2 relaxation curves of algae samples sourced from Lake Wateree in South Carolina are analyzed. A clear correlation between the relaxation rate and MP concentration of the samples is observed, and the viability of the proposed scheme for MP-based estimations concerning algae is discussed.

AB Standing dead structures of habitat-forming organisms (e.g., dead trees, coral skeletons, oyster shells) killed by a disturbance are material legacies that can affect ecosystem recovery processes. Many ecosystems are subject to different types of disturbance that either remove biogenic structures or leave them intact. Here we used a mathematical model to quantify how the resilience of coral reef ecosystems may be differentially affected following structure-removing and structure-retaining disturbance events, focusing in particular on the potential for regime shifts from coral to macroalgae. We found that dead coral skeletons could substantially diminish coral resilience if they provided macroalgae refuge from herbivory, a key feedback associated with the recovery of coral populations. Our model shows that the material legacy of dead skeletons broadens the range of herbivore biomass over which coral and macroalgae states are bistable. Hence, material legacies can alter resilience by modifying the underlying relationship between a system driver (herbivory) and a state variable (coral cover).

AB Characterization of the structural and electron transport properties of single chiral molecules provides critical insights into the interplay between their electronic structure and electrochemical environments, providing broader implications given the significance of molecular chirality in chiroptical applications and pharmaceutical sciences. Here, we examined the topographic and electronic features of a recently developed chiral molecule, B,N-embedded double hetero[7]helicene, at the edge of Cu(100)-supported NaCl thin film with scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. An electron transport energy gap of 3.2 eV is measured, which is significantly larger than the energy difference between the highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals given by theoretical calculations or optical measurements. Through first-principles calculations, we demonstrated that this energy discrepancy results from the Coulomb interaction between the tunneling electron and the molecule's electrons. This occurs in electron transport processes when the molecule is well decoupled from the electrodes by the insulating decoupling layers, leading to a temporary ionization of the molecule during electron tunneling. Beyond revealing properties concerning a specific molecule, our findings underscore the key role of Coulomb interactions in modulating electron transport in molecular junctions, providing insights into the interpretation of scanning tunneling spectroscopy features of molecules decoupled by insulating layers.

AB We present a model for virus-cell adhesion that can be used for quantitative extraction of adhesive properties from atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based force spectroscopy measurements. We extend a previously reported continuum model of viral cell interactions based on a single parameter representing adhesive energy density by using a cohesive zone model in which adhesion is represented by two parameters, a pull-off stress and associated characteristic displacement. This approach accounts for the deformability of the adhesive receptors, such as the Spike protein and transmembrane immunoglobulin and mucin domain (TIM) family that mediate adhesion of SARS-CoV-2 and Ebola viruses, and the omnipresent glycocalyx. Our model represents receptors as a Winkler foundation and aims to predict the pull-off force needed to break the adhesion between the virus and the cell. By comparing the force-separation curves simulated by the model and experimental data, we found that the model can effectively explain the AFM pull-off force trace, thus allowing quantification of the adhesion parameters. Our model provides a more refined understanding of viral cell adhesion and also establishes a framework for interpreting and predicting AFM force spectroscopy measurements.

AB Transfer learning is beneficial by allowing the expressive features of models pretrained on large-scale datasets to be finetuned for the target task of smaller, more domain-specific datasets. However, there is a concern that these pretrained models may come with their own biases which would propagate into the finetuned model. In this work, we investigate bias when conceptualized as both spurious correlations between the target task and a sensitive attribute as well as underrepresentation of a particular group in the dataset. Under both notions of bias, we find that (1) models finetuned on top of pretrained models can indeed inherit their biases, but (2) this bias can be corrected for through relatively minor interventions to the finetuning dataset, and often with a negligible impact to performance. Our findings imply that careful curation of the finetuning dataset is important for reducing biases on a downstream task, and doing so can even compensate for bias in the pretrained model.

AB Materials that combine high stiffness with effective damping are in high demand across various industries. While polymers excel in damping, they often lack stiffness and thermal stability. Conversely, metals and ceramics boast high mechanical and thermal properties but lack damping. This study demonstrates that graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) films can achieve exceptional viscoelastic properties across a wide temperature range. Furthermore, it explains the damping mechanisms and structural characteristics that influence the unique viscoelastic behavior of GO and rGO films. Through comprehensive characterizations, this study correlates the structure and spatial variation in local strain (measured with in situ Raman microscopy) of GO and rGO films with their storage and loss moduli. This correlation links these properties to the water loss as a function of the temperature rise. GO and rGO films exhibited a damping coefficient of 0.2-0.4 while maintaining stiffness values of 10-20 GPa in the 30-120 C-degrees range. These high damping values were attributed to intermittent slippage and hydrogen bond density between the constituent sheets. Numerical modeling was conducted to further elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the properties noted in these films. This study enhances our understanding of the viscoelastic properties of GO films and offers a new potential material for applications across various fields.

TI Geometry Optimization: A Comparison of Different Open-Source Geometry
   Optimizers
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION
LA English
DT Article
ID ALGORITHM
AB Based on a series of energy minimizations with starting structures obtained from the Baker test set of 30 organic molecules, a comparison is made between various open-source geometry optimization codes that are interfaced with the open-source QUantum Interaction Computational Kernel (QUICK) program for gradient and energy calculations. The findings demonstrate how the choice of the coordinate system influences the optimization process to reach an equilibrium structure. With fewer steps, internal coordinates outperform Cartesian coordinates, while the choice of the initial Hessian and Hessian update method in quasi-Newton approaches made by different optimization algorithms also contributes to the rate of convergence. Furthermore, an available open-source machine learning method based on Gaussian process regression (GPR) was evaluated for energy minimizations over surrogate potential energy surfaces with both Cartesian and internal coordinates with internal coordinates outperforming Cartesian. Overall, geomeTRIC and DL-FIND with their default optimization method as well as with the GPR-based model using Hartree-Fock theory with the 6-31G** basis set needed a comparable number of geometry optimization steps to the approach of Baker using a unit matrix as the initial Hessian to reach the optimized geometry. On the other hand, the Berny and Sella offerings in ASE outperformed the other algorithms. Based on this, we recommend using the file-based approaches, ASE/Berny and ASE/Sella, for large-scale optimization efforts, while if using a single executable is preferable, we now distribute QUICK integrated with DL-FIND.

TI Self-interacting neutrinos in light of large-scale structure data
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
LA English
DT Article
ID HUBBLE TENSION; LOCAL VALUE
AB We explore a self-interacting neutrino cosmology in which neutrinos experience a delayed onset of freestreaming. We use the effective field theory of large-scale structure (LSS) to model matter distribution on mildly nonlinear scales within the self-interacting neutrino cosmology for the first time. We perform the first combined likelihood analysis of BOSS full-shape galaxy clustering, weak lensing, and Lyman-a forest measurements, together with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck. We find that the full dataset strongly favors presence of a flavor-universal neutrino self-interaction, with a characteristic energy scale of order 10 MeV. The preference is at the similar to 5a level and is primarily driven by the Lyman-a forest measurements and, to a lesser extent, the weak lensing data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES). The self-interacting neutrino model eases both the Hubble tension and the S8 tension between different cosmological datasets, but it does not resolve either. Finally, we note a preference for a nonzero sum of neutrino masses at the level of similar to 0.3 eV under this model, consistent with previous bounds. These results call for further investigation in several directions, and may have significant implications for neutrino physics and for future new-physics searches with galaxy surveys.

AB The advanced capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have made them invaluable across various applications, from conversational agents and content creation to data analysis, research, and innovation. However, their effectiveness and accessibility also render them susceptible to abuse for generating malicious content, including phishing attacks. This study explores the potential of using four popular commercially available LLMs, i.e., ChatGPT (GPT 3.5 Turbo), GPT 4, Claude, and Bard, to generate functional phishing attacks using a series of malicious prompts. We discover that these LLMs can generate both phishing websites and emails that can convincingly imitate well-known brands and also deploy a range of evasive tactics that are used to elude detection mechanisms employed by anti-phishing systems. These attacks can be generated using unmodified or "vanilla" versions of these LLMs without requiring any prior adversarial exploits such as jailbreaking. We evaluate the performance of the LLMs towards generating these attacks and find that they can also be utilized to create malicious prompts that, in turn, can be fed back to the model to generate phishing scams - thus massively reducing the prompt-engineering effort required by attackers to scale these threats. As a countermeasure, we build a BERT-based automated detection tool that can be used for the early detection of malicious prompts to prevent LLMs from generating phishing content. Our model is transferable across all four commercial LLMs, attaining an average accuracy of 96% for phishing website prompts and 94% for phishing email prompts. We also disclose the vulnerabilities to the concerned LLMs, with Google acknowledging it as a severe issue. Our detection model is available for use at Hugging Face, as well as a ChatGPT Actions plugin.

TI Non-Abelian anyons with Rydberg atoms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
LA English
DT Article
ID QUANTUM; BLOCKADE; GATES
AB We study the emergence of topological matter in two-dimensional systems of neutral Rydberg atoms in Ruby lattices. While Abelian anyons have been predicted in such systems, non-Abelian anyons, which would form a substrate for fault-tolerant quantum computing, have not been generated. To generate anyons with non-Abelian braiding statistics, we consider systems with mixed-boundary punctures. We obtain the topologically distinct ground states of the system numerically using the infinite Density Matrix Renormalization Group technique. We discuss how these topological states can be created using ancilla atoms of a different type. We show that a system with 2N + 2 punctures and an equal number of ancilla atoms leads to N logical qubits whose Hilbert space is determined by a set of stabilizing conditions on the ancilla atoms. Quantum gates can be implemented using a set of gates acting on the ancilla atoms that commute with the stabilizers and realize the braiding group of non-Abelian Ising anyons.

ID NETWORK
AB 3D grey image segmentation has become a promising approach to facilitate practical applications with the help of advanced deep learning models. Although a number of previous works have investigated the vulnerability of deep learning models to backdoor attack, there is no work to study the severe risk of backdoor attack on 3D grey image segmentation. To this end, we propose two backdoor attack methods on 3D grey image segmentation, including Full-control Backdoor Attack (FCBA) and Partial-control Backdoor Attack (PCBA), on 3D grey image segmentation by leveraging a frequency trigger injection function and a rotation-based label corruption function. Our proposed trigger injection function is applied to insert a 3D trigger pattern into the benign 31) grey images in the frequency domain while ensuring the invisibility of the trigger pattern. And the proposed rotation-based label corruption function is employed to yield the crafted labels with the aim of decreasing the performance of segmentation. Finally, through comprehensive experiments on a real-world dataset, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed backdoor models, the frequency trigger injection function, and the rotation -based label corruption function.

TI Phononic bath engineering of a superconducting qubit
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
AB Phonons, the ubiquitous quanta of vibrational energy, play a vital role in the performance of quantum technologies. Conversely, unintended coupling to phonons degrades qubit performance and can lead to correlated errors in superconducting qubit systems. Regardless of whether phonons play an enabling or deleterious role, they do not typically admit control over their spectral properties, nor the possibility of engineering their dissipation to be used as a resource. Here we show that coupling a superconducting qubit to a bath of piezoelectric surface acoustic wave phonons enables a novel platform for investigating open quantum systems. By shaping the loss spectrum of the qubit via the bath of lossy surface phonons, we demonstrate preparation and dynamical stabilization of superposition states through the combined effects of drive and dissipation. These experiments highlight the versatility of engineered phononic dissipation and advance the understanding of mechanical losses in superconducting qubit systems.
   Hybrid quantum acoustic systems integrating qubits with phonons offer a novel platform for investigating open quantum systems. Kitzman et al. report control of superposition states of a transmon qubit under the effect of drive and dissipation by engineering its coupling to a bath of surface acoustic wave phonons.

AB Data-Free Model Extraction (DFME) aims to clone a black-box model without knowing its original training data distribution, making it much easier for attackers to steal commercial models. Defense against DFME faces several challenges: (i) effectiveness; (ii) efficiency; (iii) no prior on the attacker's query data distribution and strategy. However, existing defense methods: (1) are highly computation and memory inefficient; or (2) need strong assumptions about attack data distribution; or (3) can only delay the attack or prove a model theft after the model stealing has happened. In this work, we propose a Memory and Computation efficient defense approach, named MeCo, to prevent DFME from happening while maintaining the model utility simultaneously by distributionally robust defensive training on the target victim model. Specifically, we randomize the input so that it: (1) causes a mismatch of the knowledge distillation loss for attackers; (2) disturbs the zeroth-order gradient estimation; (3) changes the label prediction for the attack query data. Therefore, the attacker can only extract misleading information from the black-box model. Extensive experiments on defending against both decision-based and score-based DFME demonstrate that MeCo can significantly reduce the effectiveness of existing DFME methods and substantially improve running efficiency.

AB Recent semi-supervised learning algorithms have demonstrated greater success with higher overall performance due to the use of better-unlabeled data representations. Nonetheless, recent research suggests that the performance of the SSL algorithm can be degraded when the unlabeled set contains out-of-distribution examples (OODs). This work addresses the following research question: How do out-of-distribution (OOD) data adversely affect semi-supervised learning algorithms? To answer this question, we investigate the critical causes of OOD's negative effect on SSL algorithms. In particular, we found that 1) certain kinds of OOD data instances that are close to the decision boundary have a more significant impact on performance than those that are further away, and 2) Batch Normalization (BN), a popular module, may degrade rather than improve performance when the unlabeled set contains OODs. To address these challenges, we developed a unified weighted robust SSL framework that can be easily extended to many existing SSL algorithms and improve their robustness against OODs. Having identified the limitations of low-order approximations in bi-level optimization, we developed an efficient bi-level optimization algorithm that could accommodate highorder approximations of the objective and could scale to a large number of inner optimization steps to learn a massive number of weight parameters. Furthermore, we conduct a theoretical analysis of the impact of faraway OODs in the BN step and propose a weighted batch normalization (WBN) procedure that uses the weights estimated by the bi-level optimization problem in the BN step. Additionally, we discuss the connection between our approach and low-order approximation techniques. Our extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly enhances the robustness of four representative SSL algorithms against OODs compared to four state-of-the-art robust SSL strategies.

AB Neuromorphic computing is a brain-inspired approach to hardware and algorithm design that efficiently realizes artificial neural networks. Neuromorphic designers apply the principles of biointelligence discovered by neuroscientists to design efficient computational systems, often for applications with size, weight and power constraints. With this research field at a critical juncture, it is crucial to chart the course for the development of future large-scale neuromorphic systems. We describe approaches for creating scalable neuromorphic architectures and identify key features. We discuss potential applications that can benefit from scaling and the main challenges that need to be addressed. Furthermore, we examine a comprehensive ecosystem necessary to sustain growth and the new opportunities that lie ahead when scaling neuromorphic systems. Our work distils ideas from several computing sub-fields, providing guidance to researchers and practitioners of neuromorphic computing who aim to push the frontier forward.

AB Purpose: Accurate prediction of the Length of Stay (LoS) and mortality in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is crucial for effective hospital management, and it can assist clinicians for real-time demand capacity (RTDC) administration, thereby improving healthcare quality and service levels.Methods: This paper proposes a novel one-dimensional (1D) multi-scale convolutional neural network architecture, namely 1D-MSNet, to predict inpatients' LoS and mortality in ICU. First, a 1D multi-scale convolution framework is proposed to enlarge the convolutional receptive fields and enhance the richness of the convolutional features. Following the convolutional layers, an atrous causal spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) module is incorporated into the networks to extract high-level features. The optimized Focal Loss (FL) function is combined with the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) to mitigate the imbalanced-class issue.Results: On the MIMIC-IV v1.0 benchmark dataset, the proposed approach achieves the optimum R-Square and RMSE values of 0.57 and 3.61 for the LoS prediction, and the highest test accuracy of 97.73% for the mortality prediction.Conclusion: The proposed approach presents a superior performance in comparison with other state-of-the-art, and it can effectively perform the LoS and mortality prediction tasks.

AB In-vehicle infotainment (IVI) platforms are getting increasingly connected. Besides Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) apps and services, the next generation of IVI platforms are expected to allow integration of third-party apps, such as usage-based insurance (UBI). Under this anticipated business model, vehicular sensor and event data can be collected and shared with selected third-party apps. However, third-parties can be malicious and have easier access to the driver's data. Several research projects and commercial products also show the possibility of leaking sensitive private information such as vehicle location via seemingly benign vehicular sensors, which can, in turn, harm the driver's privacy. Furthermore, increasing privacy regulations worldwide, such as GDPR, make privacy a major issue for the automotive industry. To overcome these problems, we present PRICAR, a framework for privacy-preserving vehicular data collection and sharing with third-parties. It enforces three data privacy goals- minimization, anonymization and sanitization - while focusing on the last one. We describe and evaluate how to sanitize user data before sharing it with a third-party by adapting two well-known techniques from anomaly detection, Change-Point Detection (CPD) and Entropy-Based Detection (EBD).

AB Environmental experiences during early life, including stress, can significantly impact brain development and behavior. Early life stress (ELS) is linked to an increased risk for various psychiatric disorders including anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders. Epigenetic mechanisms have increasingly been of interest to understand how environmental factors contribute to reprogramming the brain and alter risk and resilience to developing psychiatric disorders. However, we know very little about mobile elements or the regulation of mobile elements and their contribution to psychiatric disorders. Recently, advances in genomics have contributed to our understanding of mobile elements, including the retrotransposon LINE-1 (L1) and their potential role in mediating environmental experiences. Yet we still do not understand how these elements may contribute to psychiatric disorders. Future research leveraging cutting-edge technologies will deepen our understanding of these mobile elements. By elucidating their role in development and how stress may impact them, we may unlock new avenues for therapeutic and diagnostic innovations.

AB Magnesium hydride solids doped with transition metals have received attention recently as prospective hydrogen storage materials for a green energy source and a hydrogen economy. In this study, MgTiHn (n = 1-20) clusters were investigated for the first time by employing the B3PW91 hybrid density functional theory computational chemistry technique with all electron basis sets to determine precise cluster structures and the maximum hydrogen capacity for this model system. We find that hydrogen atoms bind to the metal cluster core until a MgTiH14 saturation limit is reached, with hydrogen dissociation from this system occurring for MgTiH15 and larger cluster sizes. This MgTiH14 cluster contains a large 16.4% hydrogen by mass. This saturation size limit and hydrogen mass percent is larger than the analogous MgScHn system previously reported. The clusters relative stabilities and electronic properties are discussed along with a possible novel hydrogen dissociation pathway. MgTiH10 and MgTiH13 clusters are predicted to be especially stable species in this size range.

AB Polar skyrmions in oxide heterostructures have recently attracted extensive interest due to their unique physical properties and potential applications. Here, we report the formation of the vortex lattice and the nanoscale polar skyrmion crystals with two-dimensional hexagonal symmetry in PbTiO3/SrTrO3 (PTO/STO) superlattices. Under an increasing external field, the system transitions from a vortex lattice phase to hexagonal polar skyrmion crystals (PSkC). The formation and annihilation process of the polar skyrmion crystals resemble the structural phase transition observed in atomic crystals. A temperature-electric field topological phase diagram is constructed, demonstrating stabilization of the vortex lattice and polar skyrmion crystals in a wide temperature and electric-field range. This study demonstrates the potential of manipulating the topological phase transition and its long-range order through an external field.

AB We investigate linear bandits in a network setting in the presence of side-observations across nodes in order to design recommendation algorithms for users connected via social networks. Users in social networks respond to their friends' activity and, hence, provide information about each other's preferences. In our model, when a learning algorithm recommends an article to a user, not only does it observe her response (e.g., an ad click) but also the side-observations, i.e., the response of her neighbors if they were presented with the same article. We model these observation dependencies by a graph G in which nodes correspond to users and edges to social links. We derive a probleminstance-dependent lower-bound on the regret of any consistent algorithm. We propose an optimization-based data-driven learning algorithm that utilizes the structure of G in order to make recommendations to users and show that it is asymptotically optimal, in the sense that its regret matches the lower-bound as the number of rounds T -> infinity. We show that this asymptotically optimal regret is upper-bounded as O(|chi(G)| log T), where |chi(G)| is the domination number of G . In contrast, a naive application of the existing learning algorithms results in O(N log T) regret, where N is the number of users.

AB Particle dynamics simulations are used to determine the shear-induced microstructure and rheology of jammed suspensions of soft particles. These suspensions, known as soft particle glasses (SPGs), have an amorphous structure at rest but transform into ordered phases in strong shear flow when the particle size distribution is relatively monodisperse. Here, a series of bidisperse SPGs with different particle radii and number density ratios are considered, and their shear-induced phase diagrams are correlated with the macroscopic rheology at different shear rates and volume fractions. These shear-induced phase diagrams reveal that a combination of these parameters can lead to the emergence of various microstructures such as amorphous, layered, crystals, and in some cases, coexistence of amorphous and ordered phases. The evolution of the shear stress is correlated with the change in the microstructure and is a shear-activated process. Stress shows pseudo-steady behavior during an induction period before the final microstructural change leading to the formation of ordered structures. The outcomes provide a promising method to control the phase behavior of soft suspensions and build new self-assembled microstructures.

AB The photo-enhanced electrocatalytic method of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) shows promise for enhancing the effectiveness of clear energy generation through water splitting by using renewable and sustainable source of energy. However, despite benefits of photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) water splitting, its uses are constrained by its low efficiency as a result of charge carrier recombination, a large overpotential, and sluggish reaction kinetics. Here, we illustrate that Nickel telluride (NiTe) synthesized by hydrothermal methods can function as an extremely effective photo-coupled electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (POER) catalyst. In this study, NiTe was synthesized by hydrothermal method at 145 degrees C within just an hour of reaction time. In dark conditions, the NiTe deposited on carbon cloth substrate shows a small oxygen evolution reaction overpotential (261 mV) at a current density of 10 mA cm-2, a reduced Tafel slope (65.4 mV dec-1), and negligible activity decay after 12 h of chronoamperometry. By virtue of its enhanced photo response, excellent light harvesting ability, and increased interfacial kinetics of charge separation, the NiTe electrode under simulated solar illumination displays exceptional photoelectrochemical performance exhibiting overpotential of 165 mV at current density of 10 mA cm-2, which is about 96 mV less than on dark conditions. In addition, Density Functional Theory investigations have been carried out on the NiTe surface, the results of which demonstrated a greater adsorption energy for intermediate -OH on the catalyst site. Since the -OH adsorption on the catalyst site correlates to catalyst activation, it indicates the facile electrocatalytic activity of NiTe owing to favorable catalyst activation. DFT calculations also revealed the facile charge density redistribution following intermediate -OH adsorption on the NiTe surface. This work demonstrates that arrays of NiTe elongated nanostructure are a promising option for both electrochemical and photoelectrocatalytic water oxidation and offers broad suggestions for developing effective PEC devices.

AB This paper presents a conformal inference method for out-of-distribution testing that leverages side information from labelled outliers, which are commonly underutilized or even discarded by conventional conformal p-values. This solution is practical and blends inductive and transductive inference strategies to adaptively weight conformal p-values, while also automatically leveraging the most powerful model from a collection of one-class and binary classifiers. Further, this approach leads to rigorous false discovery rate control in multiple testing when combined with a conditional calibration strategy. Extensive numerical simulations show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches.

AB PurposeCities are applying reflective coatings on streets in an attempt to mitigate urban heat. These coatings are also being used to try to reduce heat stress during outdoor sports. This study models the progression of heat strain in elite marathon and race walk athletes competing on traditional dark asphalt, reflective pavement, or shaded asphalt in past and future Olympic Games [Tokyo (Sapporo), Paris, Los Angeles].MethodsObserved weather (Sapporo) or expected climate conditions for each city, along with modeled mean radiant temperature (TMRT) differences across the three surface types, were fed into the joint system (JOS-3) thermoregulation model. Resultant changes to heat strain parameters of core temperature (Tcr) and mean skin temperatures (T<overline>sk\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${\overline{T} }_{sk}$$\end{document}), as well as skin wettedness and cardiac output, were modeled.ResultsReflective pavement slightly increased the average TMRT (1.2-2.2 degrees C), which caused higher overall radiant heat loads on athletes and thus slightly higher (yet insignificant) Tcr and T<overline>sk\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${\overline{T} }_{sk}$$\end{document}. These changes in simulated heat strain (worsening the situation) are the opposite of what is expected from a heat mitigation technology.

Overall, the large impact of solar radiation (even in the morning hours) should be decreased via design strategies that block the sun rather than strategies that increase radiant heat load.

AB The Amazon Alexa marketplace has grown rapidly in recent years due to third-party developers creating large amounts of content and publishing directly to a skills store. Despite the growth of the Amazon Alexa skills store, there have been several reported security and usability concerns, which may not be identified during the vetting phase. However, user reviews can offer valuable insights into the security & privacy, quality, and usability of the skills. To better understand the effects of these problematic skills on end-users, we introduce REVIEWTRACKER, a tool capable of discerning and classifying semantically negative user reviews to identify likely malicious, policy violating, or malfunctioning behavior on Alexa skills. REVIEWTRACKER employs a pre-trained FastText classifier to identify different undesired skill behaviors. We collected over 700,000 user reviews spanning 6 years with more than 200,000 negative sentiment reviews. REVIEWTRACKER was able to identify 17,820 reviews reporting violations related to Alexa policy requirements across 2,813 skills, and 131,855 reviews highlighting different types of user frustrations associated with 9,294 skills. In addition, we developed a dynamic skill testing framework using ChatGPT to conduct two distinct types of tests on Alexa skills: one using a software-based simulation for interaction to explore the actual behaviors of skills and another through actual voice commands to understand the potential factors causing discrepancies between intended skill functionalities and user experiences. Based on the number of the undesired skill behavior reviews, we tested the top identified problematic skills and detected more than 228 skills violating at least one policy requirement. Our results demonstrate that user reviews could serve as a valuable means to identify undesired skill behaviors.

AB This article examines the history of data entry from the 1950s to the 1970s, when office automation required transforming information into computer-legible data. Often women's work, data entry was an essential step in electronic computing-one that automation proponents did not anticipate and historians have largely overlooked. Two West German cases, Allianz insurance company and Sparkassen savings banks, encountered issues when they computerized their offices. Allianz, pioneers of computerization in West Germany, unsuccessfully sought a technological solution for the data entry problem. In contrast, Sparkassen pursued a sociotechnical solution, delaying the introduction of computers until they developed technologies that circum-vented the need for data entry in the long run. Before that, they employed women for data entry on a part-time basis. These cases show that routine manual data entry was-and continues to be-a crucial part of computerizing business operations.

AB This study investigates the physics of the longitudinal stretching-based wave pumping mechanism, a novel extension of the traditional impedance pump. In its simplest form, an impedance pump consists of a fluid-filled elastic tube connected to rigid tubes with a wave generator. These valveless pumps operate based on the principles of wave propagation in a fluid-filled compliant tube. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging of the human circulatory system has shown substantial stretching of the aorta (the largest compliant artery of the body carrying blood) during the heart contraction and recoil of the aorta during the relaxation. Inspired by this dynamic mechanism, a comprehensive analysis of a longitudinal impedance pump is conducted in this study where waves are generated by stretching of the elastic wall and its recoil. We developed a fully coupled fluid-structure interaction computational model consisting of a straight fluid-filled elastic tube with longitudinal stretch at one end and a fixed reflection site at the other end. The pump's behavior is quantified as a function of stretching frequency and tube wall characteristics. Our results indicate that stretch-related wave propagation and reflection can induce frequencydependent pumping. Findings suggest a non-linear pattern for the mean flow-frequency relationship. Based on the analysis of the propagated waveforms, the underlying physical mechanism in the longitudinal impedance pump is discussed. It is shown that both the direction and magnitude of the net flow strongly depend on the wave characteristics. These findings provide a fundamental understanding of stretchrelated wave pumping and can inform the future design of such pumps.

AB Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus is a colonial hydrozoan that displays a division of labor through morphologically distinct and functionally specialized polyp types. As with all cnidarians, their venoms are housed in nematocysts, which are scattered across an individual. Here, we investigate the spatial distribution of a specific protein family, jellyfish toxins, in which multiple paralogs are differentially expressed across the functionally specialized polyps. Jellyfish toxins (JFTs) are known pore-forming toxins in the venoms of medically relevant species such as box jellyfish (class Cubozoa), but their role in other medusozoan venoms is less clear. Utilizing a publicly available single-cell dataset, we confirmed that four distinct H. symbiolongicarpus JFT paralogs are expressed in nematocyst-associated clusters, supporting these as true venom components in H. symbiolongicarpus. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry were used to localize the expression of these JFTs across the colony. These expression patterns, in conjunction with known nematocyst type distributions, suggest that two of these JFTs, HsymJFT1c-I and HsymJFT1c-II, are localized to specific types of nematocysts. We further interpret JFT expression patterns in the context of known regions of nematogenesis and differential rates of nematocyst turnover. Overall, we show that JFT expression patterns in H. symbiolongicarpus are consistent with the subfunctionalization of JFT paralogs across a partitioned venom system within the colony, such that each JFT is expressed within a specific set of functionally distinct polyp types and, in some cases, specific nematocyst types.

Ru-base B2 precipitates have shown exceptional thermal stability but can be difficult to solutionize, making high cooling rate solidification pathways like additive manufacturing (AM) a promising approach for synthesis of more homogeneous microstructures. Using single track laser experiments on aged bulk substrates, five representative refractory alloys with varying Ru-base B2 precipitates (AlRu, HfRu, TiRu) and matrix constituents (Mo, Nb) were investigated for their solidification behavior and defect susceptibility under laser melting conditions. Susceptibility to solidification cracking, solid-state cracking, and keyhole formation was found to be highly dependent on the matrix composition. Characterization of the melt pools by scanning and transmission electron microscopy shows evidence for disordered BCC upon solidification, enabling tailoring of the B2 precipitates that are thermodynamically stable above 1300 degrees C. The B2 precipitate morphologies in the melt tracks after aging treatments are influenced by the partitioning behavior of Ru from laser melting. Results from these single track experiments provide guidance toward design strategies for fabricable refractory BCC-B2 alloys.

AB The vast high entropy alloy (HEA) composition space is promising for discovery of new material phases with unique properties. This study explores the potential to achieve rare-earth-free high magnetic anisotropy materials in single-phase HEA thin films. Thin films of FeCoNiMnCu sputtered on thermally oxidized Si/SiO(2 )substrates at room temperature are magnetically soft, with a coercivity on the order of 10 Oe. After post-deposition rapid thermal annealing (RTA), the films exhibit a single face-centered-cubic phase, with an almost 40-fold increase in coercivity. Inclusion of 50 at.% Pt in the film leads to ordering of a single L1(0) high entropy intermetallic phase after RTA, along with high magnetic anisotropy and 3 orders of magnitude coercivity increase. These results demonstrate a promising HEA approach to achieve high magnetic anisotropy materials using RTA.

AB Protein stability and turnover is critical in normal cellular and physiological process and their misregulation may contribute to accumulation of unwanted proteins causing cellular malfunction, neurodegeneration, mitochondrial malfunction, and disrupted metabolism. Signaling mechanism associated with protein degradation is complex and is extensively studied. Many protein and enzyme machineries have been implicated in regulation of protein degradation. Despite these insights, our understanding of protein degradation mechanisms remains limited. Emerging studies suggest that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play critical roles in various cellular and physiological processes including metabolism, cellular homeostasis, and protein turnover. LncRNAs, being large nucleic acids (>200 nt long) can interact with various proteins and other nucleic acids and modulate protein structure and function leading to regulation of cell signaling processes. LncRNAs are widely distributed across cell types and may exhibit tissue specific expression. They are detected in body fluids including blood and urine. Their expressions are also altered in various human diseases including cancer, neurological disorders, immune disorder, and others. LncRNAs are being recognized as novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. This review article focuses on the emerging role of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), particularly long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), in the regulation of protein polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation.

LA English
DT Article
AB The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic recession negatively affected many people's physical, social, and psychological health and has been shown to change population-level mobility, but little attention has been given to park visitations as an indicator. Estimating the frequency of park visitations from aggregated mobility data of all the parks in Washington State (USA), we study trends in park use one year prior to and two years during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings indicate that the gravity model is a robust model for the park visitation behavior in different spatial resolutions of city level and state level and different socio-economical classes. Incorporating network structure, our detailed analysis highlights that high-income level residents changed their recreational behavior by visiting their local parks more and a broader recreational options outside of their local census area; whereas the low-income residents changed their visitation behavior by reducing their recreational choices.
   While it is renown that the COVID-19 pandemic affected the population mobility, little attention has been given to modeling the structural patterns of park visitations, and how these patterns have changed. The authors perform such analysis via gravity model as well as network structure analysis, and link the recreational propensity to socio-economical status of the population.

AB We introduce a Tucker tensor cross approximation method that constructs a low-rank representation of a d-dimensional tensor by sparsely sampling its fibers. These fibers are selected using the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM). Our proposed algorithm is referred to as DEIM fiber sampling (DEIM-FS). For a rank-r. approximation of an O(N-d) tensor, DEIM-FS requires access to only dNr(d-1) tensor entries, a requirement that scales linearly with the tensor size along each mode. We demonstrate that DEIM-FS achieves an approximation accuracy close to the Tucker-tensor approximation obtained via higher-order singular value decomposition at a significantly reduced cost. We also present DEIM-FS (iterative) that does not require access to singular vectors of the target tensor unfolding and can be viewed as a black-box Tucker tensor algorithm. We employ DEIM-FS to reduce the computational cost associated with solving nonlinear tensor differential equations (TDEs) using dynamical low-rank approximation (DLRA). The computational cost of solving DLRA equations can become prohibitive when the exact rank of the right-hand side tensor is large. This issue arises in many TDEs, especially in cases involving non-polynomial nonlinearities, where the right-hand side tensor has full rank. This necessitates the storage and computation of tensors of size O(N-d). We show that DEIM-FS results in significant computational savings for DLRA by constructing a low-rank Tucker approximation of the right-hand side tensor on the fly. Another advantage of using DEIM-FS is to significantly simplify the implementation of DLRA equations, irrespective of the type of TDEs. We demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm through several examples including solving high-dimensional partial differential equations.

AB We present a novel tensor interpolation algorithm for the time integration of nonlinear tensor differential equations (TDEs) on the tensor train and Tucker tensor low-rank manifolds, which are the building blocks of many tensor network decompositions. This paper builds upon our previous work (Donello et al., 2023) on solving nonlinear matrix differential equations on low-rank matrix manifolds using CUR decompositions. The methodology we present offers multiple advantages: (i) It delivers near-optimal computational savings both in terms of memory and floating-point operations by leveraging cross algorithms based on the discrete empirical interpolation method to strategically sample sparse entries of the time-discrete TDEs to advance the solution in low-rank form. (ii) Numerical demonstrations show that the time integration is robust in the presence of small singular values. (iii) High-order explicit Runge-Kutta time integration schemes are developed. (iv) The algorithm is easy to implement, as it requires the evaluation of the full-order model at strategically selected entries and does not use tangent space projections, whose efficient implementation is intrusive. We demonstrate the efficiency of the presented algorithm for several test cases, including a nonlinear 100-dimensional TDE for the evolution of a tensor of size 70(100)approximate to 3.2x10(184 )and a stochastic advection-diffusion-reaction equation with a tensor of size 4.7x10(9).

AB A new low-rank approximation, referred to as time-dependent principal component analysis (tPCA), is developed for reduced-order modeling (ROM) of scalar transport in turbulent reactive flows. In t-PCA, the evolution of the composition matrix is constrained to a low-rank matrix manifold, similar to that in standard PCA. Specifically, the t-PCA approximates the composition matrix through the multiplication of two thin, time-dependent matrices that represent spatial and composition subspaces. The evolution equations for these subspaces are derived by projecting the composition transport equation onto the tangent space of the low-rank matrix manifold. While the evolution equations for the spatial subspace in both PCA and t-PCA are similar, there are differences in how the composition subspace is obtained: (i) In t-PCA, the composition subspace is time-dependent, whereas in PCA, it is static. (ii) The t-PCA does not require any prior data, and an evolution equation for the composition subspace is derived. In PCA, the composition subspace is obtained from data. The t-PCA can be regarded as an on-the-fly low-rank approximation that can adapt to changes in the flow instantaneously. It is shown that the low-rank t-PCA approximations achieve residual levels lower than those obtained via PCA. For demonstrations and a comparative assessment of the ROMs, simulations are conducted of a non-premixed CO/H2 flame in a temporally evolving jet. Two cases are considered, based on the mechanisms previously suggested for combustion kinetics of this flame: (i) the GRI-Mech 3.0 model involving 53 species for a two-dimensional flame, (ii) the skeletal syngas model involving 11 species for a threedimensional turbulent flame. The results are appraised via a posteriori comparisons against data generated via full-rank direct numerical simulation (DNS) of the same flame, and also with the PCA-reduced data from the DNS. It is shown that t-PCA yields excellent predictions of various features of the thermo-chemistry field.

AB This work opens a new chapter in the 100, 000 year-old concept of paint, by leveraging innovations in nano-technology in the sub-THz frequency range. More specifically, the groundbreaking concept of Internet of Paint (IoP) is introduced along with a comprehensive channel model and a capacity analysis for nano-scale radios embedded in paint and communicating through paint. Nano-network devices, integrated within a paint medium, communicate via a multipath strategy, encompassing direct waves, reflections from interfaces, and lateral wave propagation. The evaluation incorporates three distinct paint types to assess path losses, received powers, and channel capacity. Analysis of path loss indicates a slight non-linear increase with both frequency and Line of Sight (LoS) distance between transceivers. Notably, paints with high refractive indexes result in the highest path loss. Moreover, burying transceivers at similar depths near the Air-Paint interface showcases promising performance of lateral waves with increasing LoS distance. Increasing paint layer depth leads to amplified attenuation, while total received power exhibits promising results when in close proximity to the Air-Paint interface but steeply declines with burial depth. Additionally, a substantial reduction in channel capacity is observed with LoS distance and burial depth, so transceivers need to be close together and in proximity of the A-P interface to communicate effectively. Comparing paint and air mediums, IoP demonstrates approximately two orders of magnitude reduction in channel capacity compared to air-based communication channels. This paper provides valuable insights into the potential of IoP communication within paint mediums and offers a foundation for further advancements in this emerging field.

AB In this study, the impact response and damage mechanisms of carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) and glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) hybrid face sheet sandwich composites are investigated with the aim to provide an understanding and solution to mitigate the coupling effects of low temperature and low velocity impact damage. Hybridization of face sheet is achieved by stacking CFRP and GFRP in different thickness configurations. Samples are subjected to low-velocity impact at 23 degrees C and -70 degrees C to compare and understand the effect of cold temperature in the Arctic environment. Results show that hybridization improves the impact performance at -70 degrees C. CFRP layers and foam core become extremely brittle at low temperature, but GFRP layers maintain a certain extent of ductility and enhanced laminate strength at low temperature. Moreover, different damage modes (delamination, fiber breakage, core crushing, core shear, face sheet debonding, back face fiber splitting) are observed and characterized by X-ray micro-computed tomography. The additions of GFRP layers to CFRP face sheet mitigated the increased brittle fiber failure observed at low temperatures, however the impact characteristics and damage size was found to be dependent on the hybridization configuration.

AB UAVs have been studied and manufactured to help create wireless communications networks that are more flexible and cost-effective than a typical wireless network. These UAV networks could help bridge the digital divide in rural America by providing wireless communications service to areas where cell companies find it too expensive to build conventional cell towers. To test different aspects of a UAV based millimeter-wave frequency network, we created a MATLAB simulation. The simulation visualizes a digital twin of a farm in eastern Nebraska where UAVs are tested. The simulation allows for link budgeting and interference management calculations by accommodating changes in transmitter and receiver location, frequency of the network, power of the transmitted signal, weather conditions, and antenna specifications. The simulation is able to calculate critical network values such as signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), path loss, atmospheric loss, and antenna gains under dynamically changing conditions.

AB The issue of the thermal environment in urban open spaces has grown more noticeable due to the combined impact of global warming and the urban heat island effect. Insufficient research has been conducted on the impact of geometric space shape on the thermal environment, despite its significance as a public area. This paper analyses the influence of the geometric space shape of a sunken square on thermal comfort in Chongqing. The evaluation index used is PET, and the methods of field measurement and software simulation are employed. A prediction model is established to examine the relationship between the geometric space shape of the sunken square and thermal comfort. The findings indicate that space view factor (SVF), slope angle, and orientation are the primary determinants influencing the thermal conditions of a submerged square. The SVF and aspect ratio are directly proportional to the pet value of the sunken square, but the slope angle, (width/height) W/H ratio, and depth are inversely proportional to the pet value of the sunken square. Planting a combination of shrubs and grass on the ground is more favorable for enhancing the thermal conditions of the sunken area.

AB Researchers and policymakers often claim that harsh climate conditions intensify the risk of armed conflict by acting as a "threat multiplier." Yet, new data reveal that locations with seasonal environmental variations face higher conflict risk than locations with permanently harsh climate, e.g., due to the ability of populations accustomed to harsh climatic conditions to develop adaptation practices. Focusing on the Sahel, we investigate underexplored relationships between the location and timing of environmental and agricultural resource variability, and their impact on conflict. We argue that in Sahara Desert transition locations, harsh climate gives people a greater willingness to engage in competitive violence over resources compared with other locations. However, this will happen only in times of relatively high levels of environmental security and agricultural resource abundance, which give people the opportunity to act on these incentives. We test this argument on a new monthly dataset of 0.5 by 0.5-degree grid cells covering the entire African continent and find robust support for our expectations. In illustrating that both spatially and temporally disaggregated data are necessary for understanding climate-conflict relationships, our findings delineate new directions of research and policymaking.

AB Concealable stigmatized identities (CSIs) are identities that can be kept hidden and carry negative stereotypes. To understand the potential influence instructors have as role models, we must first explore the identities instructors have and whether they disclose those identities to undergraduates. We surveyed national samples of science instructors (n = 1248) and undergraduates (n = 2428) at research institutions to assess the extent to which instructors hold CSIs, whether they reveal those identities to undergraduates, how the prevalence of CSIs among instructors compares to their prevalence among undergraduates, and the reasons instructors reveal or conceal their CSIs. The most common CSIs instructors reported were having anxiety (35%) and being a first-generation college student (29%). Relatively few instructors revealed CSIs to students. The largest mismatches of CSI prevalence were for struggling academically in college (-30%) and having anxiety (-25%); all mismatches grew when accounting for instructor CSI disclosure, highlighting that students perceive fewer role models of scientists with CSIs than actually exist.

AB This paper develops stability and stabilization for systems of fully coupled jump diffusions. Such systems frequently arise in numerous applications where each subsystem (component) is operated under the influ-ence of other subsystems (components). It derives sufficient conditions under which the underlying system of coupled jump diffusions is stable. The results are then applied to investigate the stability of linearizable jump diffusions, fast-slow coupled jump diffusions. Moreover, weak stabilization of interacting systems and consensus of leader-following systems are examined.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Acoustic wave devices using standing wave configurations have gained interest in various fields like healthcare diagnostics and manufacturing. Their functionalities span from cell sorting to microscale fiber assembly through periodic acoustic pressure fields. Conventional methods usually require parallel acoustic emitters and reflective surfaces, producing constrained standing wave patterns. In this paper, an effective approach for creating versatile acoustic standing wave fields using an acoustic metasurface deflector and retroreflector is introduced. The deflector manipulates the direction of incoming acoustic waves coupled with the retroreflector to reflect these waves back to the source. The proposed design allows the creation of standing waves that are not constrained by the relative angles of the two surfaces involved and allows for customizable wave patterns beyond the standard limits with enhanced adaptability. The system's effectiveness is evaluated through computational simulations using finite element analysis and experimental validation based on a 3D-printed prototype. Results suggest that versatile standing waves between arbitrarily oriented surfaces can be produced through the careful design of the metasurface deflector and retroreflector. This approach can improve the performance of standing wave applications in particle manipulation, thus broadening the range of practical implementations for ultrasound and acoustofluidic technologies.
   A novel method for generating versatile standing wave fields using an acoustic metasurface deflector and retroreflector is introduced. By overcoming traditional constraints of parallel surfaces, the approach enables customizable wave patterns and enhances applications in particle manipulation. Computational simulations and experimental validations demonstrate its potential to greatly enhance ultrasound and acoustofluidic technologies.image (c) 2024 WILEY-VCH GmbH

ID CELL-DERIVED EXOSOMES; PEPTIDE; MODEL; MSC
AB Exosomes are being increasingly explored in biomedical research for wound healing applications. Exosomes can improve blood circulation and endocrine signaling, resulting in enhanced cell regeneration. However, exosome treatments suffer from low retention and bioavailability of exosomes at the wound site. Hydrogels are a popular tool for drug delivery due to their ability to encapsulate drugs in their network and allow for targeted release. Recently, hydrogels have proven to be an effective method to provide increased rates of wound healing when combined with exosomes that can be applied noninvasively. We have designed a series of single-domain protein-based hydrogels capable of physical cross-linking and upper critical solution temperature (UCST) behavior. Hydrogel variant Q5, previously designed with improved UCST behavior and a significantly enhanced gelation rate, is selected as a candidate for encapsulation release of exosomes dubbed Q5Exo. Q5Exo exhibits low critical gelation times and significant decreases in wound healing times in a diabetic mouse wound model showing promise as an exosome-based drug delivery tool and for future hybrid, noninvasive protein-exosome design.

AB What can we learn from undercited scholars in the water, energy, food (WEF) nexus literature? Do these works vary from the most commonly cited scholarship? Using a reverse citation systematic review method, the authors find a set of 78 novel yet undercited papers (<5 citations) in the food, water, energy nexus literature from lesser represented perspectives and various geographic origins that enhance current understandings around the nexus. Through text analysis, we compared the abstracts of undercited works to the most highly-cited WEF nexus ar-ticles and found that these articles shared similar language and themes. We also found several differences in how some of the most common words were used. Our results also show a higher geographic diversity of authors within the undercited works compared to highly cited. This methodological approach and our research findings have important implications for default search engine structure and scholarly visibility, both of which are important to carefully contemplate as we work to both promote a more inclusive academic enterprise and strive to make advances toward sustainable management of food, water, and energy systems.

AB Background: Predicting phenotypes from genetic variation is foundational for fields as diverse as bioengineering and global change biology, highlighting the importance of efficient methods to predict gene functions. Linking genetic changes to phenotypic changes has been a goal of decades of experimental work, especially for some model gene families, including light-sensitive opsin proteins. Opsins can be expressed in vitro to measure light absorption parameters, including lambda max -the wavelength of maximum absorbance-which strongly affects organismal phenotypes like color vision. Despite extensive research on opsins, the data remain dispersed, uncompiled, and often challenging to access, thereby precluding systematic and comprehensive analyses of the intricate relationships between genotype and phenotype. Results: Here , we report a newly compiled database of all heterologously expressed opsin genes with lambda max phenotypes that we call the Visual Physiology Opsin Database (VPOD). VPOD_1.0 contains 864 unique opsin genotypes and corresponding lambda max phenotypes collected across all animals from 73 separate publications. We use VPOD data and deepBreaks to show regression-based machine learning (ML) models often reliably predict lambda max , account for nonadditive effects of mutations on function, and identify functionally critical amino acid sites. Conclusion: The ability to reliably predict functions from gene sequences alone using ML will allow robust exploration of molecularevolutionary patterns governing phenotype, will inform functional and evolutionary connections to an organism's ecological niche, and may be used more broadly for de novo protein design. Together, our database, phenotype predictions, and model comparisons lay the groundwork for future research applicable to families of genes with quantifiable and comparable phenotypes.

AB Computer science (CS) teachers are still learning how to enact culturally-sustaining/revitalizing CS education for Indigenous students. In response, elementary teachers on the Wind River Reservation, a professional development provider, researchers, and the Wyoming Department of Education formed a researcher-practitioner collaborative to implement and study the implementation of culturally- sustaining/revitalizing CS lessons using design-based implementation research (DBIR) practices. Researchers collected data via interviews, reflection forms, and observations. Findings indicated that teachers used students' funds of knowledge to support engagement and expanded lessons to reflect Indigenous priorities of language revitalization and Tribal sovereignty. Creating culturally-sustaining/revitalizing CS education was a collective activity, drawing on interdependence of teachers and students.

AB There are many numerical methods for solving partial different equations (PDEs) on manifolds such as classical implicit, finite difference, finite element, and isogeometric analysis methods which aim at improving the interoperability between finite element method and computer aided design (CAD) software. However, these approaches have difficulty when the domain has singularities since the solution at the singularity may be multivalued. This paper develops a novel numerical approach to solve elliptic PDEs on real, closed, connected, orientable, and almost smooth algebraic curves and surfaces. Our method integrates numerical algebraic geometry, differential geometry, and a finite difference scheme which is demonstrated on several examples.

AB This paper focuses on systems of nonlinear second-order stochastic differential equations with multiscales. The motivation for our study stems from mathematical physics and statistical mechanics, for example, Langevin dynamics and stochastic acceleration in a random environment. Our aim is to carry out asymptotic analysis to establish large deviations principles. Our focus is on obtaining the desired results for systems under weaker conditions. When the fast-varying process is a diffusion, neither Lipschitz continuity nor linear growth needs to be assumed. Our approach is based on combinations of the intuition from Smoluchowski--Kramers approximation and the methods initiated in [A. A. Puhalskii, Ann. Probab., 44 (2016), pp. 3111--3186] relying on the concepts of relatively large deviations compactness and the identification of rate functions. When the fast-varying process is under a general setup with no specified structure, the paper establishes the large deviations principle of the underlying system under the assumption on the local large deviations principles of the corresponding first-order system.

AB Photoresponsive conjugated polymers are a promising target for modern organic electronics. Numerous photoswitchable repeat units have been included covalently within polymeric structures to enable responsive chromic materials, most commonly through side-chain appendages or through formal conjugation along a pi-conjugated backbone. We recently disclosed a new design whereby the photoswitch elements are cross conjugated to a conjugated polymer main chain. In this case, we found that the extent of photoconversion was dictated in part by competitive main chain light absorption, which could be suppressed by using a photoswitching motif that carried most of the frontier molecular orbital densities. Here, we report the modeling and synthesis of a series of thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (TT)-based photochromes with various aromatic flankers imparting varying degrees of steric bulk and pi-conjugation in order to elucidate the balancing act between steric and electronic factors to promote photochromism. These model systems provide a better understanding of the behavior of photochromic units within extended oligomeric and polymeric pi-conjugated materials.
   Thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-based diarylethene photochromes present an opportunity to engineer orthogonal conjugation pathways through photoswitchable conjugated polymers. We previously showed the importance of balancing main-chain polymer conjugation with that of the pendant photochrome arms. Herein, we examine structural challenges to this main-chain conjugation, using computational tools to predict photochromism based on conformational considerations. Steric biases along the main-chain polymer backbone led to differing degrees of frontier molecular orbital localization at the switch arms, which subsequently influenced the extent of observed photochromism.image

AB Urban mobility can be significantly disrupted by various extreme events. The disruptions threaten urban spatial connectivity and affect people's ability to access various essential services. Accurate characterization and timely alert of the critical transitions of urban mobility networks can help mitigate the above risks. However, there lacks an approach to characterize the critical transition state of urban mobility networks and warn their transitions during extreme events. The universality of the characteristics of disrupted mobility networks across different cities is another fundamental question that remains underexplored. By mining big geodata, we construct the mobility networks of the 50 most populous Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) in the U.S., and study their disruption patterns by conducting network percolation analysis. We find that all mobility networks experience abrupt transitions when reaching a universal critical threshold, at which the giant components of neighborhoods suddenly collapse and dissolve into small clusters. We also develop an indicator, by analyzing the neighborhood cluster distributions, that approximates how far a mobility network is to the critical threshold and provides an early warning of its critical transition. Our findings provide insights into mobility and neighborhood connectivity in cities, which can provide guidance for transportation management, epidemic control, and emergency evacuation.

AB The exposure of ecologically critical invertebrates to pharmaceutically active compounds in aquatic environments has been one of the major concerns over the past decade, which also adds serious risk to the aquatic ecosystem. However, the metabolic level perturbations in invertebrates in response to sub-lethal doses of pharmaceuticals are still rarely studied, especially in the marine coastal environment. In this study, the diclofenac regulation of southern hard clam Mercenaria campechiensis metabolites at different time points and concentrations was investigated using NMR-based metabolomics. As a result, clam metabolic profile perturbations were observed under both low and high concentrations of diclofenac exposure in one week according to principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA); however, the potential influenced metabolic pathways were distinctly different. The low-concentration group showed significant taurine upregulation, which indicated self-protection from osmotic stress. However, the metabolites succinate, alanine, and glutamate were significantly upregulated at the relatively high concentration of diclofenac, which was a sign of anaerobic activities. The metabolic profile perturbations in week 2 showed high similarity in both low- and high-concentration groups, and the osmotic protectants betaine and taurine were significantly downregulated. The study indicated the early markers of diclofenac exposure in M. campechiensis, which provided pioneering results for monitoring the toxicity of pharmaceuticals to marine coastal water.

ID EVOLUTIONARY DYNAMICS
AB In this paper, a client-edge-cloud hierarchical federated learning (FL) model has been developed for connected vehicle applications. Generalized models are aggregated on the cloud server, while customized models trained on local data with similar data distribution are aggregated on the edge server, which mitigates the impact of data heterogeneity. To reduce the communication overhead of FL, clients will periodically update to the edge server and edge servers will periodically update to the cloud server. Moreover, we propose a mean field game-based probabilistic device selection scheme. Jointly considering their contributions and the population diversity, a fraction of devices will be selected to join the FL iteration. Taking driving range estimation as an example of connected vehicle applications in the experiment, we have shown that the proposed FL frameworks can increase the prediction accuracy by 28.9% with 5 times fewer clients' participation, compared with the vanilla FL.

AB Tumor cells have high metabolic demands, leading to increased oxygen consumption and further exacerbating hypoxia, which has been regarded as a characteristic feature of solid tumors and plays a significant role in tumor growth, resistance to therapy, and overall treatment outcomes. Hypoxia-specific sensing probes are currently in urgent need to provide valuable information for tumor detection and monitoring. In this work, we developed a new near-IR fluorescence-emitting biosensor with a high fluorescence quantum yield for hypoxia detection in tumor tissues. In the presence of nitroreductase enzyme under tumor hypoxia, the nitro group of the biosensor molecule is converted into an amino group, and the resulting compound turns itself into a nonfluorescent dye through a self-immolating process, thus turning off the fluorescence emission of the biosensor. The fluorescence change of the biosensor in response to nitroreductase is sensitive and selective and is not influenced by the presence of other physiologically important species. In the in vitro and in vivo bioimaging experiments, the biosensor demonstrated high efficiency in detecting hypoxia and the capability of distinguishing solid tumors of different sizes, indicating its potential applications in tumor diagnosis and progression monitoring.

AB Functional data are frequently accompanied by a parametric template that describes the typical shapes of the functions. However, these parametric tem-plates can incur significant bias, which undermines both utility and interpretabil-ity. To correct for model misspecification, we augment the parametric template with an infinite-dimensional nonparametric functional basis. The nonparamet-ric basis functions are learned from the data and constrained to be orthogonal to the parametric template, which preserves distinctness between the paramet-ric and nonparametric terms. This distinctness is essential to prevent functional confounding, which otherwise induces severe bias for the parametric terms. The nonparametric factors are regularized with an ordered spike-and-slab prior that provides consistent rank selection and satisfies several appealing theoretical prop-erties. The versatility of the proposed approach is illustrated through applications to synthetic data, human motor control data, and dynamic yield curve data. Rela-tive to parametric and semiparametric alternatives, the proposed semiparametric functional factor model eliminates bias, reduces excessive posterior and predictive uncertainty, and provides reliable inference on the effective number of nonpara-metric terms-all with minimal additional computational costs.

AB Arctic cyclones (ACs) are a primary driver of surface weather in the Arctic, contributing to heat and moisture transport and forcing short-term sea ice variability. Still, our understanding of the processes that drive ACs, particularly their large scales and long lifetimes, is limited. ACs are commonly associated with one or more cyclonic tropopause polar vortices (TPVs), potential vorticity (PV) anomalies in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere that may spur baroclinic development in the surface system, though the exact processes that link the two have yet to be fully explored. In this study, we investigate physical links between TPVs, especially their mesoscale structure and moisture pro fi les, and ACs with idealized observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs). Starting with a nature run, we simulate different types of dropsonde observations over a TPV during the nascent phase of a nearby AC. The Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS) and the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) ensemble adjustment Kalman fi lter are then used to run experiments to test the impact of these detailed TPV observations. In addition to a control, fi ve main experiments are conducted, assimilating new observations of temperature and humidity. All experiments reduce forecast errors at the surface and throughout the troposphere. Additional humidity observations alter vertical PV distributions, which in turn impact the development of the AC. Experiments with additional temperature observations exhibit improvements in TPV structure and surrounding PV features and produce stronger surface cyclones with skillful TPV forecasts for up to 36 h longer than the control.

AB Conventional catheter- or probe-based in vivo biomedical sensing is uncomfortable, inconvenient, and sometimes infeasible for long-term monitoring. Existing implantable sensors often require an invasive procedure for sensor placement. Untethered soft robots with the capability to deliver the sensor to the desired monitoring point hold great promise for minimally invasive biomedical sensing. Inspired by the locomotion modes of snakes, we present here a soft kirigami robot for sensor deployment and real-time wireless sensing. The locomotion mechanism of the soft robot is achieved by kirigami patterns that offer asymmetric tribological properties that mimic the skin of the snake. The robot exhibits good deployability, excellent load capacity (up to 150 times its own weight), high-speed locomotion (0.25 body length per step), and wide environmental adaptability with multimodal movements (obstacle crossing, locomotion in wet and dry conditions, climbing, and inverted crawling). When integrated with passive sensors, the versatile soft robot can locomote inside the human body, deliver the passive sensor to the desired location, and hold the sensor in place for real-time monitoring in a minimally invasive manner. The proof-of-concept prototype demonstrates that the platform can perform real-time impedance monitoring for the diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease.

AB In this paper, we study the twisted gauging on the (1+1)d lattice and construct various non-local mappings on the lattice operators. To be specific, we define the twisted Gauss law operator and implement the twisted gauging of the finite group on the lattice motivated by the orbifolding procedure in the conformal field theory, which involves the data of non-trivial element in the second cohomology group of the gauge group. We show the twisted gauging is equivalent to the two-step procedure of first applying the SPT entangler and then untwisted gauging. We use the twisted gauging to construct the triality (order 3) and p-ality (order p) mapping on the Zp x Zp symmetric Hamiltonians, where p is a prime. Such novel non-local mappings generalize Kramers-Wannier duality and they preserve the locality of symmetric operators but map charged operators to non-local ones. We further construct quantum process to realize these non-local mappings and analyze the induced mappings on the phase diagrams. For theories that are invariant under these non-local mappings, they admit the corresponding non-invertible symmetries. The non-invertible symmetry will constrain the theory at the multicritical point between the gapped phases. We further give the condition when the non-invertible symmetry can have symmetric gapped phase with a unique ground state.

These codes are designed for locality and availability, and their particular parameters depend on the choice of curve and its properties. Due to the construction, the numbers of rational points of intersection between curves and lines play a key role. To demonstrate that and generate new families of locally recoverable codes (LRCs) with high availabilty, we focus on norm-trace-lifted codes.

AB This work demonstrates how first-principles statistical mechanics approaches within a Bayesian framework can quantify and propagate uncertainties to downstream thermodynamic calculations. To address the issue of Bayesian prior selection, knowledge of 0 K ground states in the material system of interest is incorporated into the prior. The effectiveness of this framework is shown by creating a phase diagram for the fcc zirconium nitride system, including confidence intervals on order-disorder transition temperatures.

AB Time-series generation has crucial practical significance for decision-making under uncertainty. Existing methods have various limitations like accumulating errors over time, significantly impacting downstream tasks. We develop a novel generation method, DT-VAE, that incorporates generalizable domain knowledge, is mathematically justified, and significantly outperforms existing methods by mitigating error accumulation through a cumulative difference learning mechanism. We evaluate the performance of DT-VAE on several downstream tasks using both semi-synthetic and real time-series datasets, including benchmark datasets and our newly curated COVID-19 hospitalization datasets. The COVID-19 datasets enrich existing resources for time-series analysis. Additionally, we introduce Diverse Trend Preserving (DTP), a time-series clustering-based evaluation for direct and interpretable assessments of generated samples, serving as a valuable tool for evaluating time-series generative models.

AB Unsupervised monocular depth estimation techniques have demonstrated encouraging results but typically assume that the scene is static. These techniques suffer when trained on dynamical scenes, where apparent object motion can equally be explained by hypothesizing the object's independent motion, or by altering its depth. This ambiguity causes depth estimators to predict erroneous depth for moving objects. To resolve this issue, we introduce Dynamo-Depth, an unifying approach that disambiguates dynamical motion by jointly learning monocular depth, 3D independent flow field, and motion segmentation from unlabeled monocular videos. Specifically, we offer our key insight that a good initial estimation of motion segmentation is sufficient for jointly learning depth and independent motion despite the fundamental underlying ambiguity. Our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on monocular depth estimation on Waymo Open [34] and nuScenes [3] Dataset with significant improvement in the depth of moving objects. Code and additional results are available at https://dynamo-depth.github.io.

ID PARAMETRIC DOWNCONVERSION; DIRECT GENERATION; CRYSTAL FIBER; TRIPLETS
AB This work presents a probability theory of coincidence detection to address the detection limit of time-correlated photon sources. We use Bayes' theorem to model instruments a noisy communication channel and apply statistical inference to identify the minimum detectable coincidence rate. Photon triplet generation is considered as a case study to illustrate application of coincidence detection theory for time-correlated photon sources that are based spontaneous parametric down-conversion. A triplet generation rate of 1-100 Hz is required for source characterization performed over 1-72 hours using superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors. We envision the connection between Bayes' theorem and coincidence detection opens a new avenue for applying signal processing techniques available in information theory to photon coincidence measurements. 2024 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

AB Parasitism is ubiquitous, yet little is known about the evolutionary mechanisms that lead to a parasitic lifestyle. Facultative parasites can switch between free-living and parasitic lifestyles, which may provide an opportunity for researchers to study the genetic mechanisms underlying a transition to parasitism. The oligochaete Dero (Allodero) hylae is a facultative parasite commonly found within the ureter of various anuran species, such as the Cuban tree frog (Osteopilus septentrionalis). The Dero hylae worm passes into the frog's cloaca, where it then infects the ureter. In the ureter, the worm loses its free-living characteristics such as hair setae, dorsal setae, a digestive tract, and fossa with gills as it transitions to a parasitic lifestyle. The parasite may be expelled from its host during urination, and when this occurs the worm will reacquire its free-living characteristics. The focus of this study was to compare the differential gene expression profiles observed when this rapid morphological change takes place. Specimens of D. hylae were extracted from wild Cuban tree frogs and either flash-frozen to capture the parasitic RNA gene expression profile or cultured for 2 wk and allowed to metamorphose to their free-living stage and then flash-frozen. The extracted RNA was used for de novo transcriptome assembly, and we conducted a differential gene expression analysis using an RNA Tag-Seq approach for both the free-living and parasitic life forms. Based on these results, we identified 213 differentially expressed transcripts between the 2 developmental forms, with 190 of these up-regulated in the free-living life form. Although over half of the differential genes recovered did not result in any significant BLAST hits, many of these genes did provide insight into which molecular signals are potentially used after the parasite transforms into the free-living form. This analysis provides significant insight into differentially expressed transcripts associated with the drastic morphological changes observed in this rare case of oligochaete parasitism by D. hylae encompassing both free-living and parasitic forms.

AB The magnonic excitations of a dimerized, one-dimensional, antiferromagnetic chain can be trivial or topological depending on the signs and magnitudes of the alternating exchange couplings and the anisotropy. The topological phase that occurs when the signs of the two different exchange couplings alternate is qualitatively different from that of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. A material that may exhibit these properties is the quasi-one-dimensional material MoI3 that consists of dimerized chains weakly coupled to adjacent chains. The magnetic ground state and its excitations are analyzed both analytically and numerically using exchange and anisotropy parameters extracted from density functional theory calculations.

DE Computation on encrypted data; functional encryption (FE);
   privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML); trustworthy AI
AB With the advent of functional encryption (FE), new possibilities for the computation of encrypted data have arisen. FE enables data owners to grant third-party access to perform specified computations without disclosing their inputs. It also provides computation results in plaintext, unlike fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). The ubiquitousness of machine learning (ML) has led to the collection of massive private data in the cloud computing environment. This raises potential privacy issues and underscores the need for more private and secure computing solutions. Numerous efforts have been made in privacy-preserving ML (PPML) to address security and privacy concerns. There are approaches based on FHE, secure multiparty computation (SMC), and, more recently, FE. Compared to FHE-based PPML techniques, FE-based PPML is still in its infancy. In this article, we provide a survey of PPML works based on FE, summarizing state-of-the-art literature. We focus on inner product-FE, function-hiding inner product encryption, and quadratic-FE-based ML models for PPML applications. We analyze the performance and usability of the available FE libraries and their applications to PPML. We also discuss future research directions for FE-based PPML approaches. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to survey FE-based PPML approaches.

ID SEISMIC FRAGILITY; HIGHWAY BRIDGES; SYSTEMS; CURVES; DESIGN
AB Although fragility function development for structures is a mature field, it has recently thrived on new algorithms propelled by machine learning (ML) methods along with heightened emphasis on functions tailored for community- to regional-scale application. This article seeks to critically assess the implications of adopting alternative traditional and emerging fragility modeling practices within seismic risk and resilience quantification to guide future analyses that span from the structure to infrastructure network scale. For example, this article probes the similarities and differences in traditional and ML techniques for demand modeling, discusses the shift from one-parameter to multiparameter fragility models, and assesses the variations in fragility outcomes via statistical distance concepts. Moreover, the previously unexplored influence of these practices on a range of performance measures (e.g. conditional probability of damage, risk of losses to individual structures, portfolio risks, and network recovery trajectories) is systematically evaluated via the posed statistical distance metrics. To this end, case studies using bridges and transportation networks are leveraged to systematically test the implications of alternative seismic fragility modeling practices. The results show that, contrary to the classically adopted archetype fragilities, parameterized ML-based models achieve similar results on individual risk metrics compared to structure-specific fragilities, promising to improve portfolio fragility definitions, deliver satisfactory risk and resilience outcomes at different scales, and pinpoint structures whose poor performance extends to the global network resilience estimates. Using flexible fragility models to depict heterogeneous portfolios is expected to support dynamic decisions that may take place at different scales, space, and time, throughout infrastructure systems.

AB Women's underrepresentation in academic fields and professions emphasizing high intellectual talents persists as a prominent societal issue. To explore early antecedents of this gender imbalance, the present study investigated the developmental changes in children's social preference of boys and girls who pursue brilliance-required (vs. effort-required) activities. Importantly, we took an intersectional perspective to explore whether children consider target race in their social preference. Five- to 9-year-old U.S. children (N = 207; M-age = 7.53; 104 girls and 103 boys; 48% White) were presented with pairs of Asian, Black, and White characters matched in gender. One character was depicted as enjoying a game requiring high intellectual talents and the other enjoyed a game requiring effort. Participants were then asked to choose the character that they liked more, as an indicator of their social preference. With age, children became increasingly likely to prefer White boys and girls of color (i.e., Black and Asian girls) pursuing activities requiring brilliance (vs. activities requiring effort). In contrast, children did not develop increasing social preference for White girls or boys of color who opt in for brilliance-required activities. Our data suggest that, as early as elementary school years, children's social preference in contexts valuing sheer brilliance becomes both gendered and racialized. These findings highlight the importance of using an intersectional approach to identify the specific developmental processes that contribute to social disparities in brilliance-required contexts.

AB The future application of Li metal batteries (LMBs) at scale demands electrolytes that endow improved performance under fast-charging and low-temperature operating conditions. Recent works indicate that desolvation kinetics of Li+ plays a crucial role in enabling such behavior. However, the modulation of this process has typically been achieved through inducing qualitative degrees of ion pairing into the system. In this work, we find that a more quantitative control of the ion pairing is crucial to minimizing the desolvation penalty at the electrified interface and thus the reversibility of the Li metal anode under kinetic strain. This effect is demonstrated in localized electrolytes based on strongly and weakly bound ether solvents that allow for the deconvolution of solvation chemistry and structure. Unexpectedly, we find that maximum degrees of ion pairing are suboptimal for ultralow temperature and high-rate operation and that reversibility is substantially improved via slight local dilution away from the saturation point. Further, we find that at the optimum degree of ion pairing for each system, weakly bound solvents still produce superior behavior. The impact of these structure and chemistry effects on charge transfer are then explicitly resolved via experimental and computational analyses. Lastly, we demonstrate that the locally optimized diethyl ether-based localized-high- concentration electrolytes supports kinetic strained operating conditions, including cycling down to -60 degrees C and 20-min fast charging in LMB full cells. This work demonstrates that explicit, quantitative optimization of the Li+ solvation state is necessary for developing LMB electrolytes capable of low-temperature and high-rate operation.

ID SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; TRADE-OFF
AB In engineering design, global sensitivity analysis (GSA) is used for analyzing the effects of the system inputs on the model response. Common GSA methods use analytical or surrogate models to study the relationships between model inputs and outputs. However, the accuracy of such system models depends on the complete conformance to all model assumptions. Even so, they are not flexible and fail to capture nonlinear behaviors in complex systems. Besides these GSA approaches, interpretable machine learning would also identify the relationships between system variables, eliminating the disadvantages of common GSA implementations. Apart from studying the independent variables individually, the evaluation of groups of them is likewise valuable. One example motivation in engineering design for performing GSA with groups of input variables would be managing the design space complexity in programmable material systems (PMS) development. In this article, we employ a flexible, interpretable artificial neural network model to uncover individual as well as grouped global sensitivity indices for understanding complex physical interactions in engineering design. The employed model allows the investigation of the feature importance of the main effects and pairwise interaction effects in GSA according to functional analysis of variance (ANOVA) decomposition. To draw a higher-level understanding, we further use a subset decomposition method to analyze the significance of the groups of input variables. Using PMS as an example, we demonstrate the use of our approach for understanding the impact of material, architecture, and stimulus variables as well as their interactions for a programmable photonic metasurface system. This information lays the foundation for deriving design guidelines for PMS development.

AB Machine learning models are vulnerable to maliciously crafted Adversarial Examples (AEs). Training a machine learning model with AEs improves its robustness and stability against adversarial attacks. It is essential to develop models that produce high-quality AEs. Developing such models has been much slower in natural language processing (NLP) than in areas such as computer vision. This paper introduces a practical and efficient adversarial attack model called SSCAE for Semantic, Syntactic, and Context-aware natural language AEs generator. SSCAE identifies important words and uses a masked language model to generate an early set of substitutions. Next, two well-known language models are employed to evaluate the initial set in terms of semantic and syntactic characteristics. We introduce (1) a dynamic threshold to capture more efficient perturbations and (2) a local greedy search to generate high-quality AEs. As a black-box method, SSCAE generates humanly imperceptible and context-aware AEs that preserve semantic consistency and the source language's syntactical and grammatical requirements. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed SSCAE model are illustrated with fifteen comparative experiments and extensive sensitivity analysis for parameter optimization. SSCAE outperforms the existing models in all experiments while maintaining a higher semantic consistency with a lower query number and a comparable perturbation rate.

AB In superionic crystals, liquid-like ionic diffusivities often come hand-in-hand with ultra-low thermal conductivity and soft vibrational dynamics. However, generalized relationships between ion transport and vibrational dynamics remain elusive due to the diversity of superionic materials and complex underlying mechanisms. Here, the links between vibrational dynamics and ion transport in close-packed lithium halide ion conductor Li3YCl6 (LYC) are examined using a suite of atomistic first-principles methods. It is shown that configurational disorder, lattice anharmonicity, and coupled host-mobile ion vibrational dynamics together induce a transition to the superionic state. Statistical correlations between ionic hops and activation of the distribution of vibrational modes are found. However, typical phenomena associated with superionic conductors such as selective breakdown of zone-boundary soft phonons, or long wavelength transverse acoustic modes as in the 'phonon-liquid-electron crystal' concept, are not present. Instead, anharmonic zone-boundary modes aiding Li diffusion are found to broaden and soften selectively but persist across the superionic transition. These anharmonic modes couple Li ion motion with the vibrations of the flexible close-packed anion framework, which remains stable and facilitates ionic hopping. The results provide insights into how configurational disorder and soft-yet-resilient vibrational modes enable ionic hopping, particularly in 3D close-packed crystals.

AB The possibility that climate change will increase the risk of civil war by causing agricultural decline, thereby increasing competition over scarce resources, is the focus of a vastly expanding research agenda. Yet, an emerging body of work suggests that agricultural abundance, not scarcity, drives violence. This study illustrates that debates over whether scarcity or abundance does more to drive violence can be adjudicated with greater attention to actor (government, rebel, or militia), violence, and crop types. It leverages new spatiotemporal monthly data to assess the relationship between local cash crop productivity and violence against civilians by state forces, rebels, and militias, accounting for the impact of climatic and socioeconomic indicators, across 14 countries in the Sahel between January 2006 and December 2018. Aggregating data on local agricultural production for 42 crops alongside a vegetation coverage indicator, a monthly measure of local cash crop productivity is created, and its impact on the monthly rates of violence against civilian by these three actors is estimated. Results indicate that rebel and militia attacks increase by about twofold in cash crop-producing locations during peak productivity months, whereas state force attacks do not. This suggests that nonstate actors are more dependent on local sources of revenue and follow demand-based incentives to use violence to facilitate appropriation.

AB Online hate is an escalating problem that negatively impacts the lives of Internet users, and is also subject to rapid changes due to evolving events, resulting in new waves of online hate that pose a critical threat. Detecting and mitigating these new waves present two key challenges: it demands reasoning-based complex decision-making to determine the presence of hateful content, and the limited availability of training samples hinders updating the detection model. To address this critical issue, we present a novel framework called HATEGUARD for effectively moderating new waves of online hate. HATEGUARD employs a reasoning-based approach that leverages the recently introduced chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting technique, harnessing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). HATEGUARD further achieves prompt-based zero-shot detection by automatically generating and updating detection prompts with new derogatory terms and targets in new wave samples to effectively address new waves of online hate. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we compile a new dataset consisting of tweets related to three recently witnessed new waves: the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the 2021 insurrection of the US Capitol, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Our studies reveal crucial longitudinal patterns in these new waves concerning the evolution of events and the pressing need for techniques to rapidly update existing moderation tools to counteract them. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art approaches illustrate the superiority of our framework, showcasing a substantial 10.59% to 88% improvement in detecting the three new waves of online hate. Our work highlights the severe threat posed by the emergence of new waves of online hate and represents a paradigm shift in addressing this threat practically.

AB Mobile edge computing (MEC) has emerged as a key architecture in the Internet of Things (IoT) that allows the otherwise power-limited wireless devices (WD) to carry out high-performance computation. This work considers a typical one-server multi-user MEC system, where each WD, with a computational task to excute, can divide its tasks for local and edge computing. Such partial task offloading decisions will be selected together with other resource allocation variables by minimizing the overall energy-delay cost (EDC). In the presence of unknown system model, the EDC function is not available in analytical form, and instead only the function values at queried points are revealed. Towards solving such a bandit optimization in a sample-efficient manner, we will rely on the Bayesian optimization framework, that relies on a surrogate model, typically the Gaussian process (GP), to actively select the query points. Coping with the possibly dynamic learning environment, an ensemble (E) of GP models with data-adaptive weights will be leveraged for surrogate modeling, following which acquisition of next evaluation point will be selected using the sotermed Thompson sampling (TS) rule. Numerical tests validate the merits of the proposed EGP-TS approach relative to existing alternatives under a practical MEC setting.

AB This study presents a data-driven analysis of a Level-3 EV charging station on a major interstate highway in a northern rural region of the United States, focusing on adherence to the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) formula program. Utilizing two years of 15-minute smart meter data, this paper presents the power demand dynamics and characteristics of this EV charging station. This study investigates charging trends and behaviors over various time frames, including monthly, seasonal, and weekday periods. The Charging Behavior (CB) index, a novel metric, is developed to quantify and compare charging behavior patterns. Besides, this study investigates the correlation between the power demand of the charging station and the corresponding traffic counts. The result shows that the correlation is particularly relevant in seasonal variations in northern rural areas. The findings from this comprehensive analysis are vital for stakeholders in the power sector, aiding in the strategic planning and optimization of EV charging infrastructure under NEVI compliance, especially in remote regions that have the four-season climate. The study's insights are also crucial for researchers focusing on the sustainable integration of EV infrastructure into existing power grids, addressing both operational planning and demand management.

AB The rapid rise of antibiotic resistance has become a critical global health concern, necessitating the development of alternative treatments, such as antibacterial nanoparticles (NPs). While the antibacterial potency of these NPs is known to depend highly on their surface chemistry, existing designs predominantly include NPs with uniform surface coatings. In this study, we present a distinctive approach to using the surface anisotropy of NPs to modulate their antibacterial efficacy. Specifically, we investigate the antibacterial properties of amphiphilic Janus nanoparticles (NPs), which display spatially separated hydrophobic and cationic ligands on opposing sides. By integrating experiments with molecular dynamics simulations, we unveil the crucial role of polycationic ligands in enhancing the interaction between Janus NPs and bacteria, ultimately leading to a significantly improved antibacterial potency. With hydrophobic and polycationic ligands spatially separated on a single NP surface, these amphiphilic Janus NPs effectively permeabilize the cell envelopes of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. As a result, they inhibit bacterial growth at lower concentrations compared with NPs with uniform surface chemistry. Moreover, we demonstrate the versatility of the Janus NPs' antibacterial activity across various types of polycationic ligands. Our findings provide a mechanistic understanding of the spatial arrangement of ligands as well as the molecular characteristics of ligands in modulating NP-bacteria interactions. This research underscores the potential of Janus NPs, a distinctive subgroup of nanoparticles characterized by their anisotropic surface chemistry, as a unique class of antibacterial materials.

AB Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown satisfying performance on various graph learning tasks. To achieve better fitting capability, most GNNs are with a large number of parameters, which makes these GNNs computationally expensive. Therefore, it is difficult to deploy them onto edge devices with scarce computational resources, e.g., mobile phones and wearable smart devices. Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a common solution to compress G NNs, where a light-weighted model (i.e., the student model) is encouraged to mimic the behavior of a computationally expensive GNN (i.e., the teacher GNN model). Nevertheless, most existing CNN-based KD methods lack fairness consideration. As a consequence, the student model usually inherits and even exaggerates the bias from the teacher GNN. To handle such a problem, we take initial steps towards fair knowledge distillation for GNNs. Specifically, we first formulate a novel problem of fair knowledge distillation for GNNbased teacher-student frameworks. Then we propose a principled framework named RELIANT to mitigate the bias exhibited by the student model. Notably, the design of RELIANT is decoupled from any specific teacher and student model structures, and thus can be easily adapted to various GNN-based KD frameworks. We perform extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets, which corroborates that RELIANT achieves less biased GNN knowledge distillation while maintaining high prediction utility. Open-source code can be found at https://github.com/yushundong/RELIANT.

AB Plastics and composites for consumer goods often require flame retardants (FRs) to mitigate flammability risks. Finding FRs that are effective in new sustainable materials is important for bringing them to the market. This study evaluated various FRs in SunBG90 (a composite made from triglycerides and sulfur)-a high sulfur-content material (HSM) promising for use in Li-S batteries, where flame resistance is critical. SunBG90 was blended with FRs from several classes (inorganic, phosphorus-based, brominated, and nitrogen-containing) to assess compliance with UL94 Burning Test standards. Inorganic FRs showed poor flame retardancy and lower mechanical strength, while organic additives significantly improved fire resistance. The addition of 20 wt. % tetrabromobisphenol A enabled SunBG90 to achieve the highest flame retardancy rating (94V-0), while also enhancing wear resistance (52 IW, ASTM C1353) and bonding strength (26 psi, ASTM C482). Selected organic FRs also enhance compressive strength compared to the FR-free SunBG90. This research highlights the potential of HSMs with traditional FRs to meet stringent fire safety standards while preserving or enhancing the mechanical integrity of HSM composites.

AB Graph de-anonymization is a technique used to reveal connections between entities in anonymized graphs, which is crucial in detecting malicious activities, network analysis, social network analysis, and more. Despite its paramount importance, conventional methods often grapple with inefficiencies and challenges tied to obtaining accurate query graph data. This paper introduces a neural-based inexact graph de-anonymization, which comprises an embedding phase, a comparison phase, and a matching procedure. The embedding phase uses a graph convolutional network to generate embedding vectors for both the query and anonymized graphs. The comparison phase uses a neural tensor network to ascertain node resemblances. The matching procedure employs a refined greedy algorithm to discern optimal node pairings. Additionally, we comprehensively evaluate its performance via well-conducted experiments on various real datasets. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in enhancing the efficiency and performance of graph de-anonymization through the use of graph embedding vectors.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

ID FAIRNESS; BIAS
AB Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the leading paradigm for solving graph analytical problems in various real-world applications. Nevertheless, GNNs could potentially render biased predictions towards certain demographic subgroups. Understanding how the bias in predictions arises is critical, as it guides the design of GNN debiasing mechanisms. However, most existing works overwhelmingly focus on GNN debiasing, but fall short on explaining how such bias is induced. In this paper, we study a novel problem of interpreting GNN unfairness through attributing it to the influence of training nodes. Specifically, we propose a novel strategy named Probabilistic Distribution Disparity (PDD) to measure the bias exhibited in GNNs, and develop an algorithm to efficiently estimate the influence of each training node on such bias. We verify the validity of PDD and the effectiveness of influence estimation through experiments on real-world datasets. Finally, we also demonstrate how the proposed framework could be used for debiasing GNNs. Open-source code can be found at https://github.com/yushundong/BIND.

AB The room-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) battery is a promising alternative to traditional lithium-ion batteries owing to its abundant material availability and high specific energy density. However, the sodium polysulfide shuttle effect and dendritic growth pose significant challenges to their practical applications. In this study, we apply diverse disciplinary backgrounds to introduce a novel method to stimulate polarized BaTiO3 (BTO) nanoparticles on the separator. This approach generates more charges due to the piezoelectric effect under stronger driving forces produced by applying a controllable acoustic field at the outer edge of the cell. The acoustically stimulated BTO attracts more polysulfides, thus reducing the shuttling effect from the cathode to the anode and ultimately enhancing the battery performance. Meanwhile, the acoustic waves create additional streaming flows, improving the uniformity of the sodium ion dispersion, enhancing the sodium ion transport and reducing the possibility of sodium dendrite development. We believe that this work offers a new strategy for the development of high-performance Na-S batteries.

AB Short-range order (SRO) in high -entropy alloys (HEAs) has been observed both computationally and experimentally in recent studies. Despite their recognized influence on the physical properties of the HEAs reported, a comprehensive work on the relationship between SRO and the tuning of the thermodynamic properties of HEAs has been lacking. In this research, to identify the SRO -property relationship, the Warren -Cowley (WC) parameters, which quantify the degree of SRO, and thermodynamic properties in Al x CoCrFeNi HEAs were investigated, utilizing the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, hybrid molecular dynamics/Monte Carlo (MD/MC) simulations, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We examined SROs in different phases of Al x CoCrFeNi HEAs by varying aluminum (Al) contents ( x Al ) ranging from 0 to 2.0. Results reveal a prevalent negative SRO of Al -Fe and positive SRO of Al -Al pairs across all HEA cases. Under the influence of SRO parameters, lattice thermal conductivity and bulk modulus exhibit higher values, whereas coefficient of thermal expansion exhibits lower values. This research advances our understanding of the SRO -properties relationship in HEAs, contributing to the design of HEAs with tailored properties through structural tuning.

AB Eastern North America was constructed over several Wilson cycles, culminating in the breakup of Pangea. Previous seismological imaging lacked the resolution to depict precisely how ancient tectonic boundaries manifest throughout the lithosphere, how continental breakup modified the plate, or how ongoing mantle dynamics shapes the continental margin. We present a high-resolution, plate-scale seismic tomography model of the eastern US by combining an unprecedented suite of complementary data sets in a Bayesian framework. These data provide detailed resolution from crust to asthenosphere, identifying the base of the lithosphere and mid-lithospheric discontinuities. The plate thins in steps that align with ancient orogens. The lithospheric step at the Appalachian front is associated with cells of mantle upwellings, likely edge-driven convection, that erode the base of the plate and shape modern Appalachian topography. Low-velocity structures in the lithospheric-mantle align with the Grenville front and may be remnants of Rodinia assembly.
   Eastern North America was constructed through several cycles of supercontinent assembly and breakup. The North American tectonic plate contains scars of this billion-year history, but previous seismological imaging lacked the resolution to identify leftover structures that elucidate past processes or shed light on contemporary ones. We have produced a high-resolution 3-D seismological image of the eastern North American plate. Our imaging method combines numerous complementary data sets, which together provide resolution from the surface to beneath the plate. The plate is thickest where it is oldest, in the continental interior. It thins progressively eastward in steps that align well with geologically defined boundaries, and is thinnest next to the Atlantic ocean. A sharp step in plate thickness beneath the Appalachian Mountains provokes small convection cells, as cold plate drops off and hotter material ascends to replace it, pushing up the Appalachian mountains. We find a well-preserved "fossil" of a collision zone, deep within the plate, likely left over from a billion-year old supercontinent formation. The most recent supercontinent breakup, which led to Atlantic opening, has left a legacy of thin and heavily modified plate east of the Appalachians.
   We present the highest resolution map to date of lithospheric properties from craton to margin in the eastern US Steep lithospheric steps drive edge-driven convection along the margin and influence modern topography Geologic boundaries correspond to plate-spanning changes in seismic properties, including a possible continental suture

AB The fracture of polymer networks and gels has a significant impact on the performance of these versatile and widely used materials, and a molecular -level understanding of the fracture process is crucial for the design of new materials. Combining molecular dynamics simulations and network analysis techniques, we demonstrate that in the initial undeformed state of model end -linked polymer networks, polymer strands with fewer topological defects in their local surroundings, higher geodesic edge betweenness centrality values compared to the system average, and greater alignment to the loading direction are more prone to breaking under uniaxial tensile deformation.

AB The transition to low-carbon electricity is crucial for meeting global climate goals. However, given the uneven spatial distribution and temporal variability of renewable resources, balancing the supply and demand of electricity will be challenging when relying on close to 100% shares of renewable energy. Here, we use an electricity planning model with hourly supply-demand projections and high-resolution renewable resource maps, to examine whether transcontinental power pools reliably meet the growing global demand for renewable electricity and reduce the system cost. If all suitable sites for renewable energy are available for development, transcontinental trade in electricity reduces the annual system cost of electricity in 2050 by 5-52% across six transcontinental power pools compared to no electricity trade. Under land constraints, if only the global top 10% of suitable renewable energy sites are available, then without international trade, renewables are unable to meet 12% of global demand in 2050. Introducing transcontinental power pools with the same land constraints, however, enables renewables to meet 100% of future electricity demand, while also reducing costs by up to 23% across power pools. Our results highlight the benefits of expanding regional transmission networks in highly decarbonized but land-constrained future electricity systems.
   By building transcontinental power pools, Yang and colleagues find global electricity demand can be 100% met by renewables, at an affordable cost.

AB Vision foundation models are a new frontier in Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI), an interdisciplinary research area that applies and extends AI for geospatial problem solving and geographic knowledge discovery, because of their potential to enable powerful image analysis by learning and extracting important image features from vast amounts of geospatial data. This paper evaluates the performance of the first-of-its-kind geospatial foundation model, IBM-NASA's Prithvi, to support a crucial geospatial analysis task: flood inundation mapping. This model is compared with convolutional neural network and vision transformer-based architectures in terms of mapping accuracy for flooded areas. A benchmark dataset, Sen1Floods11, is used in the experiments, and the models' predictability, generalizability, and transferability are evaluated based on both a test dataset and a dataset that is completely unseen by the model. Results show the good transferability of the Prithvi model, highlighting its performance advantages in segmenting flooded areas in previously unseen regions. The findings also indicate areas for improvement for the Prithvi model in terms of adopting multi-scale representation learning, developing more end-to-end pipelines for high-level image analysis tasks, and offering more flexibility in terms of input data bands.

AB As silicon photonics transitions from research to commercial deployment, packaging solutions that efficiently couple light into highly compact and functional sub-micrometer silicon waveguides are imperative but remain challenging. The 220 nm silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform, poised to enable large-scale integration, is the most widely adopted by foundries, resulting in established fabrication processes and extensive photonic component libraries. The development of a highly efficient, scalable, and broadband coupling scheme for this platform is therefore of paramount importance. Leveraging two-photon polymerization (TPP) and a deterministic free-form micro-optics design methodology based on the Fermat's principle, this work demonstrates an ultraefficient and broadband 3-D coupler interface between standard SMF-28 single-mode fibers and silicon waveguides on the 220 nm SOI platform. The coupler achieves a low coupling loss of 0.8 dB for the fundamental TE mode, along with 1 dB bandwidth exceeding 180 nm. The broadband operation enables diverse bandwidthdriven applications ranging from communications to spectroscopy. Furthermore, the 3-D free-form coupler also enables large tolerance to fiber misalignments and manufacturing variability, thereby relaxing packaging requirements toward cost reduction capitalizing on standard electronic packaging process flows.

AB Bacterial cellulose (BC) is a versatile biopolymer with significant potential across biomedical, food, and industrial applications. To remove bacterial contaminants, such as protein and DNA, BC pellicles undergo purification, which traditionally relies on harsh alkali treatments, such as sodium hydroxide or strong surfactants, which present environmental concerns. In response, this study evaluates the efficacy of various non-conventional surfactants-both non-biodegradable and biodegradable-as alternatives for BC purification. Among the surfactants tested, sodium cocoyl isethionate (SCI), a mild anionic and biodegradable surfactant, emerged as particularly effective, achieving an 80.7% reduction in protein content and a 65.19% reduction in double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) content relative to untreated samples. However, these advantages were not without additional challenges, such as the appearance of residual surfactants. Given SCI's promising performance and biodegradability, it was further examined in two-step treatment protocols; additionally, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was also examined as a more traditional anionic surfactant as well as NaOH. For the two-step treatment protocol, BC pellicles were treated with one reagent for 3 h, followed by a second reagent for an additional 3 h. Notably, by using NaOH as the final step in the two-step treatment protocol, residual surfactant was not detected in the FTIR analysis. Overall, this work demonstrates that SCI, in addition to subsequent NaOH treatment, can be used as a surfactant-based approach for BC purification, representing a potential environmentally friendly alternative to traditional surfactant-based approaches for BC purification.

AB Residential fixed broadband internet access in the US remains inequitable, despite significant taxpayer investment. This paper evaluates the efficacy of the Connect America Fund (CAF), which subsidizes new broadband monopolies in underserved areas to provide internet access comparable to that in urban regions. CAF's oversight relies heavily on self-reported data from internet service providers (ISPs). Unfortunately, the reliability of this self-reported data has always been open to question. We use the broadband-plan querying tool (BQT) to create a novel dataset that complements ISP-reported information with ISP-advertised broadband plan details from publicly accessible websites for 537k residential addresses across 15 states. Our analysis reveals significant discrepancies, with a serviceability rate of only 55.45%, indicating that a significant fraction of addresses certified as served are still unserved. Furthermore, we observe a compliance rate of only 33.03%, indicating that a significant fraction of served addresses receive download speeds that are non-compliant with the FCC's 10 Mbps threshold for CAF-served addresses. Although we observe that CAF-served addresses occasionally receive higher download speeds than their monopoly-served neighbors, overall, the CAF program has largely failed to achieve its intended goal, leaving many targeted rural communities with inadequate or no broadband connectivity.

AB Counterfactual explanations promote explainability in machine learning models by answering the question "how should an input instance be perturbed to obtain a desired predicted label?". The comparison of this instance before and after perturbation can enhance human interpretation. Most existing studies on counterfactual explanations are limited in tabular data or image data. In this work, we study the problem of counterfactual explanation generation on graphs. A few studies have explored counterfactual explanations on graphs, but many challenges of this problem are still not well-addressed: 1) optimizing in the discrete and disorganized space of graphs; 2) generalizing on unseen graphs; and 3) maintaining the causality in the generated counterfactuals without prior knowledge of the causal model. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel framework CLEAR which aims to generate counterfactual explanations on graphs for graph-level prediction models. Specifically, CLEAR leverages a graph variational autoencoder based mechanism to facilitate its optimization and generalization, and promotes causality by leveraging an auxiliary variable to better identify the underlying causal model. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world graphs validate the superiority of CLEAR over the state-of-the-art methods in different aspects.

AB We suggest a new random model for links based on meander diagrams and graphs. We then prove that trivial links appear with vanishing probability in this model, no link L is obtained with probability 1, and there is a lower bound for the number of non-isotopic knots obtained for a fixed number of crossings. A random meander diagram is obtained through matching pairs of parentheses, a well-studied problem in combinatorics. Hence tools from combinatorics can be used to investigate properties of random links in this model, and, moreover, of the respective 3-manifolds that are link complements in 3-sphere. We use this for exploring geometric properties of a link complement. Specifically, we give expected twist number of a link diagram and use it to bound expected hyperbolic and simplicial volume of random links. The tools from combinatorics that we use include Catalan and Narayana numbers, and Zeilberger's algorithm.

AB Describing the equality conditions of the Alexandrov-Fenchel inequality [Ale37] has been a major open problem for decades. We prove that in the case of convex polytopes, this description is not in the polynomial hierarchy unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses to a finite level. This is the first hardness result for the problem and is a complexity counterpart of the recent result by Shenfeld and van Handel [SvH23], which gave a geometric characterization of the equality conditions. The proof involves Stanley's [Sta81] order polytopes and employs poset theoretic technology.

AB The remarkable piezoelectric characteristics manifested by two-dimensional (2D) materials render them immensely coveted candidates for deployment in nanoscale energy harvesting tools. In this study, we demonstrate the generation of nanoenergy from the tribo-piezoelectric effect in a 2D BeO bilayer system by employing first-principles density functional theory calculations. We find that compression and sliding motions between two BeO layers produce a substantial tribo-piezoelectric effect. Lateral sliding of the upper BeO layer while the bottom BeO layer remains fixed engenders tribological energy from the vertical resistance force. Through tribological energy conversion, we show how BeO bilayers may overcome the interfacial sliding barrier and generate tribo-piezoelectricity. We obtain maximum energy corrugation in the range of 101-301 meV and shear strength in the range of 0.4-2.38 GPa during vertical compression. The highest out-of-plane piezoelectricity is obtained when the bilayers are in the A-A stacking configuration by lateral sliding. A maximum induced voltage of similar to 0.22 V is attained through the vertical compressive sliding of the upper layer. These findings offer potential opportunities for harvesting nanoenergy from the tribo-piezoelectric effect of BeO systems, paving the way for advancing the field of self-powered sensors, wireless electronics, and wearable devices.

ID SEISMOGRAPHIC NETWORK; CO2 STORAGE
AB The implementation of passive-seismic monitoring is essential for the geological carbon storage projects. For secure and continuous observing of induced passive-seismic events by CO2 injecting, a ground geophone network would be required. By determining the ideal number of seismic stations within a regular network, recent research has enhanced monitoring capabilities while also accommodating budgetary limitations. The primary objective of the optimal placement strategy for the surface geophone network is to create a cost-effective monitoring system. Given the cost limitations, a restricted quantity of sensors can be deployed at each location to maximize monitoring performance. To address this challenge, our approach involves the P-median stochastic programming formulation. The formulation aims to minimize the expected value of a monitoring target metric, which ultimately results in the optimal placement of detectors exhibiting superior expected behaviors. Our methodology is designed to choose the arrangement of detectors with best performance to improve both the early alarm detection time and localization capabilities of the sensor network. We utilize site-specific passive-seismic scenarios that capture the uncertainty in the characteristics of carbon leakage. The sensor grids provided by the optimization method invariably improve the capacity to detect passive -seismic events in comparison to sensors positioned in a regular grid configuration. We test the effectiveness of our approach on synthetic data based on a carbon storage site named Kimberlina. In conclusion, our approach provides a cost-effective solution for the optimal placement of sensors to achieve superior monitoring performance for the detection of passive-seismic events. The incorporation of site-specific scenarios with stochastic uncertainty coverage allows for more accurate and reliable results, leading to better decision-making for long-term geological carbon storage.

AB The lack of sex-specific cardiovascular disease criteria contributes to the underdiagnosis of women compared to that of men. For more than half a century, the Framingham Risk Score has been the gold standard to estimate an individual's risk of developing cardiovascular disease based on the age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, diabetes status, and the smoking status. Now, machine learning can offer a much more nuanced insight into predicting the risk of cardiovascular diseases. The UK Biobank is a large database that includes traditional risk factors and tests related to the cardiovascular system: magnetic resonance imaging, pulse wave analysis, electrocardiograms, and carotid ultrasounds. Here, we leverage 20,542 datasets from the UK Biobank to build more accurate cardiovascular risk models than the Framingham Risk Score and quantify the underdiagnosis of women compared to that of men. Strikingly, for a first-degree atrioventricular block and dilated cardiomyopathy, two conditions with non-sex-specific diagnostic criteria, our study shows that women are under-diagnosed 2x and 1.4x more than men. Similarly, our results demonstrate the need for sex-specific criteria in essential primary hypertension and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Our feature importance analysis reveals that out of the top 10 features across three sexes and four disease categories, traditional Framingham factors made up between 40% and 50%; electrocardiogram, 30%-33%; pulse wave analysis, 13%-23%; and magnetic resonance imaging and carotid ultrasound, 0%-10%. Improving the Framingham Risk Score by leveraging big data and machine learning allows us to incorporate a wider range of biomedical data and prediction features, enhance personalization and accuracy, and continuously integrate new data and knowledge, with the ultimate goal to improve accurate prediction, early detection, and early intervention in cardiovascular disease management.

AB The eXtensible Resource Allocation Service (XRAS), a comprehensive allocations environment for managing the submission, review, and awarding of resource allocations has been essential to managing the resource allocation needs of the national cyberinfrastructure for the past decade. As a software-as-a-service platform, XRAS supports not only the needs of its primary stakeholder program, but also the processes of half a dozen other national and regional resource providers. Over the past decade, XRAS has continuously improved on its original feature set and added new features to better meet the needs of its clients. Today, XRAS supports a core workload of 500 allocation requests each quarter, and the development roadmap for the system is focused on expanding the types of resources XRAS supports, enabling resources to be integrated in novel ways, and increasing the number of resource federations that XRAS can support. In this paper, we describe key aspects of resource allocations that have guided XRAS development; discuss the current XRAS clients and our approach to sustainability; and briefly describe the XRAS architecture and how it integrates with client sites and the ORCID ecosystem. We then turn to the XRAS architecture and client integration capabilities and describe major features of XRAS developed over the past decade. Finally, we outline future work planned for XRAS.

AB As a key ingredient of batteries for electric vehicles (EVs), lithium plays a significant role in climate change mitigation, but lithium has considerable impacts on water and society across its life cycle. Upstream extraction methods-including open-pit mining, brine evaporation, and novel direct lithium extraction (DLE)-and downstream processes present different impacts on both the quantity and quality of water resources, leading to water depletion and contamination. Regarding upstream extraction, it is critical for a comprehensive assessment of lithium's life cycle to include cumulative impacts related not only to freshwater, but also mineralized or saline groundwater, also known as brine. Legal frameworks have obscured social and ecological impacts by treating brine as a mineral rather than water in regulation of lithium extraction through brine evaporation. Analysis of cumulative impacts across the lifespan of lithium reveals not only water impacts in conventional open-pit mining and brine evaporation, but also significant freshwater needs for DLE technologies, as well as burdens on fenceline communities related to wastewater in processing, chemical contaminants in battery manufacturing, water use for cooling in energy storage, and water quality hazards in recycling. Water analysis in lithium life cycle assessments (LCAs) tends to exclude brine and lack hydrosocial context on the environmental justice implications of water use by life cycle stage. New research directions might benefit from taking a more community-engaged and cradle-to-cradle approach to lithium LCAs, including regionalized impact analysis of freshwater use in DLE, as well as wastewater pollution, cooling water, and recycling hazards from downstream processes.

AB Embodied agents must detect and localize objects of interest, e.g. traffic participants for self-driving cars. Supervision in the form of bounding boxes for this task is extremely expensive. As such, prior work has looked at unsupervised instance detection and segmentation, but in the absence of annotated boxes, it is unclear how pixels must be grouped into objects and which objects are of interest. This results in over-/under-segmentation and irrelevant objects. Inspired by human visual system and practical applications, we posit that the key missing cue for unsupervised detection is motion: objects of interest are typically mobile objects that frequently move and their motions can specify separate instances. In this paper, we propose MOD-UV, a Mobile Object Detector learned from Unlabeled Videos only. We begin with instance pseudo-labels derived from motion segmentation, but introduce a novel training paradigm to progressively discover small objects and static-but-mobile objects that are missed by motion segmentation. As a result, though only learned from unlabeled videos, MOD-UV can detect and segment mobile objects from a single static image. Empirically, we achieve state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised mobile object detection on Waymo Open, nuScenes, and KITTI Datasets without using any external data or supervised models. Code is available at github.com/YihongSun/MOD-UV.

AB Communities of color have been historically excluded and marginalized in the ongoing conversations about climate preparedness and resilience at local, national, and global levels. Using focus groups composed of Boston communities of color (Asian American, Black, Latino, and Native American), this study aimed to understand their perspectives on climate change, providing in-depth knowledge of its impact and their views on preparedness and resilience. Research shows that these communities have long been concerned about climate change and emphasize the urgent need to improve climate preparedness. A multi-pronged approach is crucial: listening to communities of color to leverage local knowledge and leadership, engaging in community organizing, advocating for policy change, redirecting attention to institutional resources, and addressing systemic inequalities that exacerbate vulnerabilities. The findings of this study highlight the need for policy changes driven by collaboration and collective action, which can benefit those most negatively impacted by climate change and the lack of preparedness and resilience in Boston and beyond.

SO NPJ URBAN SUSTAINABILITY

DT Article
ID COMPLEX NETWORKS; TEMPERATURE; HEAT; TELECONNECTIONS
AB Global climate change has been shown to cause longer, more intense, and frequent heatwaves, of which anthropogenic stressors concentrated in urban areas are a critical contributor. In this study, we investigate the causal interactions during heatwaves across 520 urban sites in the U.S. combining complex network and causal analysis. The presence of regional mediators is manifest in the constructed causal networks, together with long-range teleconnections. More importantly, megacities, such as New York City and Chicago, are causally connected with most of other cities and mediate the structure of urban networks during heatwaves. We also identified a significantly positive correlation between the causality strength and the total populations in megacities. These findings corroborate the contribution of human activities e.g., anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases or waste heat, to urban heatwaves. The emergence of teleconnections and supernodes are informative for the prediction and adaptation to heatwaves under global climate change.

AB Mentioned for the first time in an article 1971, the occurrence of the term "Macrophomina phaseolina" has experienced a steep increase in the scientific literature over the past 15 years. Concurrently, incidences of M. phaseolina-caused crop diseases have been getting more frequent. The high levels of diversity and plasticity observed for M. phasolina genomes along with a rich equipment of plant cell wall degrading enzymes, secondary metabolites and putative virulence effectors as well as the unusual longevity of microsclerotia, their asexual reproduction structures, make this pathogen very difficult to control and crop protection against it very challenging. During the past years several studies have emerged reporting on host defense measures against M. phaseolina, as well as mechanisms of pathogenicity employed by this fungal pathogen. While most of these studies have been performed in crop systems, such as soybean or sesame, recently interactions of M. phaseolina with the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana have been described. Collectively, results from various studies are hinting at a complex infection cycle of M. phaseolina, which exhibits an early biotrophic phase and switches to necrotrophy at later time points during the infection process. Consequently, responses of the hosts are complex and seem coordinated by multiple defense-associated phytohormones. However, at this point no robust and strong host defense mechanism against M. phaseolina has been described.

AB In this survey, we review the recent advances in control design methods for robotic multi-agent systems (MAS), focusing on learning-based methods with safety considerations. We start by reviewing various notions of safety and liveness properties, and modeling frameworks used for problem formulation of MAS. Then we provide a comprehensive review of learning-based methods for safe control design for multi -robot systems. We start with various shielding-based methods, such as safety certificates, predictive filters, and reachability tools. Then, we review the current state of control barrier certificate learning in both a centralized and distributed manner, followed by a comprehensive review of multi-agent reinforcement learning with a particular focus on safety. Next, we discuss the state -of -the -art verification tools for the correctness of learning-based methods. Based on the capabilities and the limitations of the state -of -the -art methods in learning and verification for MAS, we identify various broad themes for open challenges: how to design methods that can achieve good performance along with safety guarantees; how to decompose single-agent-based centralized methods for MAS; how to account for communication-related practical issues; and how to assess transfer of theoretical guarantees to practice.

AB Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based bone tissue regeneration has gained significant attention due to the excellent differentiation capacity and immunomodulatory activity of MSCs. Enhancing osteogenesis regulation is crucial for improving the therapeutic efficacy of MSC-based regeneration. By utilizing the regenerative capacity of bone ECM and the functionality of nanoparticles, we recently engineered bone-based nanoparticles (BNPs) from decellularized porcine bones. The effects of internalization of BNPs on MSC viability, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation were first investigated and compared at different time points. The phenotypic behaviors, including cell number, proliferation, and differentiation were characterized and compared. By incorporating a LNA/DNA nanobiosensor and MSC live cell imaging, we monitored and compared Notch ligand delta-like 4 (Dll4) expression dynamics in the cytoplasm and nucleus during osteogenic differentiation. Pharmacological interventions are used to inhibit Notch signaling to examine the mechanisms involved. The results suggest that Notch inhibition mediates the osteogenic process, with reduced expression of early and late stage differentiation markers (ALP and calcium mineralization). The internalization of BNPs led to an increase in Dll4 expression, exhibiting a time-dependent pattern that aligned with enhanced cell proliferation and differentiation. Our findings indicate that the observed changes in BNP-treated cells during osteogenic differentiation could be associated with elevated levels of Dll4 mRNA expression. In summary, this study provides new insights into MSC osteogenic differentiation and the molecular mechanisms through which BNPs stimulate this process. The results indicate that BNPs influence osteogenesis by modulating Notch ligand Dll4 expression, demonstrating a potential link between Notch signaling and the proteins present in BNPs.

AB Doping silicon wafers without using highly toxic or corrosive chemical substances has become a critical issue for semiconductor device manufacturing. In this work, ultra-thin films of hydroxyapatite (Ca5(PO4)3OH) are prepared by tethering by aggregation and growth (T-BAG), and further processed by spike annealing. Via in situ infrared (IR), the decomposition of hydroxyapatite and intermixing with the native silicon oxide is observed already at temperatures as low as 200 degrees C. Phosphate transport through the native silicon oxide is driven by a phase transformation into a more stable thermal oxide. At 700 degrees C, diffusion of phosphorus into the sub-surface region of oxide-free silicon is observed. In situ IR combined with electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements allows to conclude that the phosphorus is: i) transported through the silicon oxide barrier, ii)) diffused inside the oxide-free silicon, and iii) finally modified the electrical activity of the silicon wafer. To further explain the experimental findings, density-functional theory (DFT) is used to demonstrate the extent of the effect of phosphorus doping on the electronic nature of silicon surfaces, showing that even small amounts of doping can have a measurable effect on the electrical performance of semiconductor wafers.
   Doping silicon wafers without using highly toxic or corrosive chemical substances is a critical issue for semiconductor device manufacturing. Peter Thissen and Roberto C. Longo investigate thin mineral layers of hydroxyapatite as a doping basis. Measurements show that the phosphorus is transported through the silicon oxide barrier, then diffuses inside the oxide-free silicon and finally changes the electrical activity. image

ID COLOR-CENTERS; NITROGEN; DIAMOND; MICROSCOPY; RESOLUTION
AB Colour centres in wide-bandgap semiconductors feature metastable charge states that can be interconverted with the help of optical excitation at select wavelengths. The distinct fluorescence and spin properties in each of these states have been exploited to show storage of classical information in three dimensions, but the memory capacity of these platforms has been thus far limited by optical diffraction. Here we leverage local heterogeneity in the optical transitions of colour centres in diamond (nitrogen vacancies) to demonstrate selective charge state control of individual point defects sharing the same diffraction-limited volume. Further, we apply this approach to dense colour centre ensembles, and show rewritable, multiplexed data storage with an areal density of 21Gbinch(-2) at cryogenic temperatures. These results highlight the advantages for developing alternative optical storage device concepts that can lead to increased storage capacity and reduced energy consumption per operation.

AB We examined whether the enforcement of phantom rules-frequently broken and rarely enforced codified rules-varies by the race of the rule breaker. First, we analyzed whether race affects when 311 calls, a nonemergency service, end in arrest in New York City. Across 10 years, we found that calls from census blocks of neighborhoods consisting of mostly White individuals were 65% less likely to escalate to arrest than those where White people were the numerical minority. Next, we experimentally manipulated transgressor race and found that participants (N = 393) who were high in social dominance orientation were more likely to route 311 calls to 911 when the transgressor was Black (vs. White). We also explored the subjective experience of phantom rule enforcement; People of color report they are more likely to be punished for violating phantom rules compared to White people. Overall, we find evidence of racism in the enforcement of phantom rules.

AB We focus on the problem of generating high-quality, private synthetic glucose traces, a task generalizable to many other time series sources. Existing methods for time series data synthesis, such as those using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), are not able to capture the innate characteristics of glucose data and cannot provide any formal privacy guarantees without severely degrading the utility of the synthetic data. In this paper we present GlucoSynth, a novel privacy-preserving GAN framework to generate synthetic glucose traces. The core intuition behind our approach is to conserve relationships amongst motifs (glucose events) within the traces, in addition to temporal dynamics. Our framework incorporates differential privacy mechanisms to provide strong formal privacy guarantees. We provide a comprehensive evaluation on the real-world utility of the data using 1.2 million glucose traces; GlucoSynth outperforms all previous methods in its ability to generate high-quality synthetic glucose traces with strong privacy guarantees.

AB Circuit-switched technologies have long been proposed for handling high-throughput traffic in datacenter networks, but recent developments in nanosecond-scale reconfiguration have created the enticing possibility of handling low-latency traffic as well. The novel Oblivious Reconfigurable Network (ORN) design paradigm promises to deliver on this possibility. Prior work in ORN designs achieved latencies that scale linearly with system size, making them unsuitable for large-scale deployments. Recent theoretical work showed that ORNs can achieve far better latency scaling, proposing theoretical ORN designs that are Pareto optimal in latency and throughput.
   In this work, we bridge multiple gaps between theory and practice to develop Shale, the first ORN capable of providing low-latency networking at datacenter scale while still guaranteeing high throughput. By interleaving multiple Pareto optimal schedules in parallel, both latency- and throughput-sensitive flows can achieve optimal performance. To achieve the theoretical low latencies in practice, we design a new congestion control mechanism which is best suited to the characteristics of Shale. In datacenter-scale packet simulations, our design compares favorably with both an in-network congestion mitigation strategy, modern receiver-driven protocols such as NDP, and an idealized analog for sender-driven protocols. We implement an FPGA-based prototype of Shale, achieving orders of magnitude better resource scaling than existing ORN proposals. Finally, we extend our congestion control solution to handle node and link failures.

ID SAFETY DECISIONS
AB Teleoperated robots are increasingly being used in construction sites, but there is still a need for better human-robot interfaces. Auditory feedback using sonification has commonly been used to complement visual feedback in teleoperation applications. However, it is not yet well understood how operational and environmental sounds can support operators in complex tasks such as construction machine operations. In this paper, we describe the development of a virtual environment to assess the impacts of operational and environmental sounds on operators' performances and cognitive loads during teleoperated demolition. Our goal is to examine whether different levels of operational and environmental sounds can increase the workers' situation awareness, operational efficiency, and safety performance. Alternatively, we anticipate that some environmental noises may negatively affect the operators' performances by increasing their mental workload and stress levels. Consequently, we plan to evaluate the effectiveness of including audio filters that minimize unwanted sounds while prioritizing desired sounds.

AB Real-time control of urban drainage systems (UDS) can reduce flood risk while enhancing water quality. However, internet-connected valves and weirs may become a liability during communications outages. Given that severe storms often cause both flooding and communications failures, it is critical that smart systems cope well with communications outages during these events. We propose a method to maintain approximately centralized predictive control of a UDS under intermittent communication by hosting approximations of the total system's dynamics and states on each networked microcontroller. This allows individual microcontrollers to act from an imperfect understanding of the total system, even when they have not communicated with the central server for several days. We show robustness to communications outages; maintaining centralized control in this case study when reporting only once every 7 days on average. We also examine the role of relative position within the network in determining the accuracy of each microcontroller's estimates of depths in the other storage basins. This investigation supports the idea that agents within a distributed control problem can make model-based inferences of total system conditions using their local measurements.

ID EXTREME WETTABILITY; TRANSPORT; DROPLETS
AB Additive manufacturing (AM) has revolutionized the production of complex geometries with superior properties compared with traditional manufacturing methods. However, the high roughness and poor wettability of as-produced surfaces of AM parts limit their suitability for certain applications. To address this, we present a maskless laser-assisted surface functionalization method to improve the wettability of metal 3D printed parts. This study explores the potential of combining metal AM with surface wettability patterning, a promising technique in fluid-related fields. Large-area AlSi10Mg parts were fabricated using laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF), followed by an innovative laser-assisted functionalization (LAF) method to achieve patterned wetting surfaces. The LAF method consists of laser texturing and chemical modification steps, and two strategies were demonstrated to fabricate different types of wettability patterns. Strategy I helps produce two types of superhydrophobicity, while strategy II helps create a superhydrophobic-superhydrophilic patterned surface. The study demonstrates the simplicity, robustness, and feasibility of the process and analyzes the processing mechanism, surface topography, and surface chemistry. The integration of surface wettability patterning and 3D-printing can optimize components to enhance performance and efficiency by creating intricate fluid flow pathways. Overall, this work highlights the potential of combining metal AM with surface wettability patterning, providing a pathway to produce high-performance parts with tailored wettability properties. This research has significant implications for fluid-related industries such as aerospace, automotive, and energy, as it offers unparalleled design freedom and the ability to create complex geometries.

AB In this work, we propose a new Gaussian process (GP) regression framework that enforces the physical constraints in a probabilistic manner. Specifically, we focus on inequality and monotonicity constraints. This GP model is trained by the quantum-inspired Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (QHMC) algorithm, which is an efficient way to sample from a broad class of distributions by allowing a particle to have a random mass matrix with a probability distribution. Integrating the QHMC into the inequality and monotonicity constrained GP regression in the probabilistic sense, our approach enhances the accuracy and reduces the variance in the resulting GP model. Additionally, the probabilistic aspect of the method leads to reduced computational expenses and execution time. Further, we present an adaptive learning algorithm that guides the selection of constraint locations. The accuracy and efficiency of the method are demonstrated in estimating the hyperparameter of high-dimensional GP models under noisy conditions, reconstructing the sparsely observed state of a steady state heat transport problem, and learning a conservative tracer distribution from sparse tracer concentration measurements.

TI Nanotube spin defects for omnidirectional magnetic field sensing
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS

DT Article
ID QUANTUM; NANOSCALE
AB Optically addressable spin defects in three-dimensional (3D) crystals and two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) materials are revolutionizing nanoscale quantum sensing. Spin defects in one-dimensional (1D) vdW nanotubes will provide unique opportunities due to their small sizes in two dimensions and absence of dangling bonds on side walls. However, optically detected magnetic resonance of localized spin defects in a nanotube has not been observed. Here, we report the observation of single spin color centers in boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) at room temperature. Our findings suggest that these BNNT spin defects possess a spin S = 1/2 ground state without an intrinsic quantization axis, leading to orientation-independent magnetic field sensing. We harness this unique feature to observe anisotropic magnetization of a 2D magnet in magnetic fields along orthogonal directions, a challenge for conventional spin S = 1 defects such as diamond nitrogen-vacancy centers. Additionally, we develop a method to deterministically transfer a BNNT onto a cantilever and use it to demonstrate scanning probe magnetometry. Further refinement of our approach will enable atomic scale quantum sensing of magnetic fields in any direction.

TI Control of work functions of nanophotonic components
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS

DT Article
AB Work function is an essential material's property playing important roles in electronics, photovoltaics, and more recently, in nanophotonics. We have studied effects of organic, and inorganic dielectric materials on work functions of Au films in single layered, and multilayered structures. We found that measured work function of metallic surfaces can be affected by dielectric materials situated 10-100 nm away from the metallic surface. We have found that, (i) the glass underneath similar to 50 nm gold slab reduces the work function of gold, (ii) Rh590:PMMA increases the work function of a gold film deposited on top of the polymer, and (iii) reduces it if Rh590:PMMA is deposited on top of Au. (iv) With increase of the Rh590 concentration in PMMA, n, the work function first decreases (at n < 64 g/l), and then increases (at n > 64 g/l). (v) The work function of a Fabry-Perot cavity or an MIM waveguide is almost the same as that of single Au films of comparable thickness. The experimental results can be qualitatively explained in terms of a simple model taking into account adhesion of charged molecules to a metallic surface, and formation of a double layer of charges accelerating or decelerating electrons exiting the metal and decreasing or increasing the work function.

TI Calculating the acoustic radiation force on spherical particles in a
   standing ultrasound wave field considering single and multiple
   scattering
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
ID MANIPULATION; SPHERES; FLUID
AB Ultrasound directed self-assembly (DSA) utilizes the acoustic radiation force (ARF) associated with a standing ultrasound wave to organize particles dispersed in a fluid medium into specific patterns. The ARF is a superposition of the primary acoustic radiation force, which results from the incident standing ultrasound wave, and the acoustic interaction force, which originates from single and multiple scattering between neighboring particles. In contrast with most reports in the literature that neglect multiple scattering when calculating the ARF, we demonstrate that the deviation between considering single or multiple scattering may reach up to 100%, depending on the ultrasound DSA process parameters and material properties. We evaluate a theoretical case with three spherical particles in a viscous medium and derive operating maps that quantify the deviation between both scattering approaches as a function of the ultrasound DSA process parameters. Then, we study a realistic system with hundreds of particles dispersed in a viscous medium, and show that the deviation between the ARF resulting from single and multiple scattering increases with decreasing particle size and increasing medium viscosity, density ratio, compressibility ratio, and particle volume fraction. This work provides a quantitative basis for determining whether to consider single or multiple scattering in ultrasound DSA simulations.

AB Recent progress in data-driven vision and language-based tasks demands developing training datasets enriched with multiple modalities representing human intelligence. The link between text and image data is one of the crucial modalities for developing AI models. The development process of such datasets in the video domain requires much effort from researchers and annotators (experts and non-experts). Researchers re-design annotation tools to extract knowledge from annotators to answer new research questions. The whole process repeats for each new question which is timeconsuming. However, since the last decade, there has been little change in how the researchers and annotators interact with the annotation process. We revisit the annotation workflow and propose a concept of an adaptable and scalable annotation tool. The concept emphasizes its users' interactivity to make annotation process design seamless and efficient. Researchers can conveniently add newer modalities to or augment the extant datasets using the tool. The annotators can efficiently link free-form text to image objects. For conducting human-subject experiments on any scale, the tool supports the data collection for attaining group ground truth. We have conducted a case study using a prototype tool between two groups with the participation of 74 non-expert people. We find that the interactive linking of free-form text to image objects feels intuitive and evokes a thought process resulting in a high-quality annotation. The new design shows similar to 35% improvement in the data annotation quality. On UX evaluation, we receive above-average positive feedback from 25 people regarding convenience, UI assistance, usability, and satisfaction.

AB Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy characterization is a powerful and easy-to-use technique frequently employed for the characterization and fingerprinting of materials. Although MXenes are a large and fastest growing family of inorganic 2D materials, the lack of systematic FTIR spectroscopy studies hinders its application to MXenes and often leads to misinterpretation of the results. In this study, we report experimental and calculated FTIR spectra of 12 most typical carbide and carbonitride MXenes with different compositions (5 transition metals) and all four basic structures, including Ti2CTx, Nb2CTx, Mo2CTx, V2CTx, Ti3C2Tx, Ti3CNTx, Mo2TiC2Tx, Mo2Ti2C3Tx, Nb4C3Tx, V4C3Tx, Ta4C3Tx, and Mo4VC4Tx. The measurements were performed on delaminated MXene flakes incorporated in KBr pellets in the 4000-400 cm(-1) range. We provide detailed instructions for sample preparation, data collection, and interpretation of FTIR spectra of MXenes. Background correction and spectra smoothing are applied to obtain clear FTIR peaks corresponding to bond vibrations in MXenes. Density functional theory calculations were used for the precise assignment of all characteristic FTIR peaks and an in-depth analysis of the vibration modes. This work aims to provide the 2D material community with the FTIR spectroscopy technique as a reliable method for identifying and analyzing MXenes.

AB The accuracy of single particle (SP) models for lithium-ion batteries at high C-rates is constrained by lithium concentration gradients in the electrolyte, which affect ionic conductivity, overpotential, and reaction rates. This study addresses these limitations using extreme gradient boosting machine learning (ML). By training our ML model with data from a comprehensive electrochemical (P2D) model and performing sensitivity analysis on key battery parameters, we enhance predictive accuracy. Compared to conventional SP and P2D models under constant current loading, our ML-based SP model achieves similar predictive accuracy to P2D, with significant improvements in computational efficiency. Additionally, the ML-based SP model demonstrates improved predictive accuracy under dynamic loading conditions, providing a practical framework for improving battery management and safety.

AB We introduce an animation system that transforms instructional videos into 3D animations with pedagogical agents, supplemented by animation editing tools to foster expressive, agent-based presentations, thereby enhancing educational benefits. Our system extracts the lecturer's motion from the imported instructional video. Once the data extraction is complete, the system retargets this motion to the virtual agent and integrates it into a virtual classroom environment. Subsequently, it provides a GUI-based animation editing tool, offering a range of resources, such as motion assets (e.g., upper body gestures, facial expressions), which enable users to layer them on top of the extracted motion to make the pedagogical agent's motions more engaging. To evaluate our system, we conducted a user study encompassing non-expert and expert groups, employing a mixed-method approach by collecting both quantitative and qualitative data. The results demonstrated our system's educational value, functionality, and usability. Furthermore, the comparative analysis between the non-expert (people with no animation experience) and expert (people with prior animation experience) user groups provided distinct perspectives on our system, reflecting differences in the user's animation experience and expertise. However, both groups reported similar usability and task load levels, indicating that non-experts can use our system efficiently to produce expressive agent-based presentations. We plan to release our system as an open source, cross-platform solution to help educators create engaging agent-based presentations.

AB Aerosol jet printing offers high resolution, broad materials compatibility, and digital patterning for flexible, conformal, and hybrid electronics. However, limited throughput, instability, and complex optimization requirements inhibit translation to industrial applications. An in-line heater integrated on a custom printer is demonstrated to modulate droplet evaporation in the aerosol phase, thereby decoupling the deposition rate of functional solids and liquid ink to enable taller, narrower features with aspect ratios reaching 0.29 for a single line. Heating the printhead from room temperature to 80 degrees C reduced the sensitivity of resolution to deposition rate by approximate to 90%, improving reliability. With this strategy, increasing the linear deposition rate by 10x results in a modest increase of 27% in line width, compared to a four-fold increase without heating, permitting higher throughput without sacrificing print quality. Providing a control for in-line drying independent of ink formulation enables rapid, straightforward design of new materials and processes. This ability to engineer drying of droplets prior to impingement provides a versatile tool to meet complex fabrication challenges, as demonstrated here for both high aspect ratio printing and conformal patterning on rough and three-dimensional surfaces.
   Printhead heating is implemented during aerosol jet printing to drive aerosol-phase drying, supporting higher throughput fabrication with minimal change in resolution. This reduces process sensitivity, provides an effective and independent control to tailor print characteristics that generalizes to different inks, and is particularly useful for challenging print requirements such as conformal and high aspect ratio patterning. image

AB Heterogenized molecular catalysts have shown interesting activities in different chemical transformations. In our previous studies, a molecular catalyst, Re(bpy)(CO)(3)Cl where bpy is 2,2 '-bipyridine, was covalently attached to silica surfaces via an amide linkage for use in photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Derivatizing the bpy ligand with electron-withdrawing amide groups led to detrimental effects on the catalytic activity of Re(bpy)(CO)(3)Cl. In this study, an alkyl amine linkage is utilized to attach Re(bpy)(CO)(3)Cl onto SiO2 in order to eliminate the detrimental effects of the amide linkage by breaking the conjugation between the bpy ligand and the amide group. However, the heterogenized Re(I) catalyst containing the alkyl amine linkage demonstrates even lower activity than the one containing the amide linkage in photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Infrared studies suggest that the presence of the basic amine group led to the formation of a photocatalytically inactive Re(I)-OH species on SiO2. Furthermore, the amine group likely contributes to the stabilization of a surface Re(I)-carboxylato species formed upon light irradiation, resulting in the low activity of the heterogenized Re(I) catalyst containing the alkyl amine linkage.

ID SUPERCONDUCTING-QUBIT
AB Transverse bulk phonons in a multimode integrated quantum acoustic device are excited and characterized via their free-space coupling to a three-dimensional (3D) microwave cavity. These bulk acoustic modes are defined by the geometry of the Y-cut lithium niobate substrate in which they reside and couple to the cavity electric field via a large dipole antenna, with an interaction strength on the order of the cavity linewidth. Using finite element modeling, we determine that the bulk phonons excited by the cavity field have a transverse polarization with a shear velocity matching previously reported values. We demonstrate how the coupling between these transverse acoustic modes and the electric field of the 3D cavity depends on the relative orientation of the device dipole, with a coupling persisting to room temperature. Our study demonstrates the versatility of 3D microwave cavities for mediating contact-less coupling to quantum, and classical, piezoacoustic devices.

AB Ensuring safety and meeting temporal specifications are critical challenges for long-term robotic tasks. Signal temporal logic (STL) has been widely used to systematically and rigorously specify these requirements. However, traditional methods of finding the control policy under those STL requirements are computationally complex and not scalable to high-dimensional or systems with complex nonlinear dynamics. Reinforcement learning (RL) methods can learn the policy to satisfy the STL specifications via hand-crafted or STL-inspired rewards, but might encounter unexpected behaviors due to ambiguity and sparsity in the reward. In this letter, we propose a method to directly learn a neural network controller to satisfy the requirements specified in STL. Our controller learns to roll out trajectories to maximize the STL robustness score in training. In testing, similar to Model Predictive Control (MPC), the learned controller predicts a trajectory within a planning horizon to ensure the satisfaction of the STL requirement in deployment. A backup policy is designed to ensure safety when our controller fails. Our approach can adapt to various initial conditions and environmental parameters. We conduct experiments on six tasks, where our method with the backup policy outperforms the classical methods (MPC, STL-solver), model-free and model-based RL methods in STL satisfaction rate, especially on tasks with complex STL specifications while being 10X-100X faster than the classical methods.

AB During the last week of June 2021, the Pacific Northwest region of North America experienced a record-breaking heatwave of historic proportions. All-time high temperature records were shattered, often by several degrees, across many locations, with Canada setting a new national record, the state of Washington setting a new record, and the state of Oregon tying its previous record. Here we diagnose key meteorology that contributed to this heatwave. The event was associated with a highly anomalous midtropospheric ridge, with peak 500-hPa geopotential height anomalies centered over central British Columbia. This ridge developed over several days as part of a large-scale wave train. Back trajectory analysis indicates that synoptic-scale subsidence and associated adiabatic warming played a key role in enhancing the mag-nitude of the heat to the south of the ridge peak, while diabatic heating was dominant closer to the ridge center. Easterly/ offshore flow inhibited marine cooling and contributed additional downslope warming along the western portions of the re-gion. A notable surface thermally induced trough was evident throughout the event over western Oregon and Washington. An eastward shift of the thermal trough, following the eastward migration of the 500-hPa ridge, allowed an inland surge of cooler marine air and dramatic 24-h cooling, especially along the western periphery of the region. Large-scale horizontal warm-air advection played a minimal role. When compared with past highly amplified ridges over the region, this event was characterized by much higher 500-hPa geopotential heights, a stronger thermal trough, and stronger offshore flow.

AB Creativity has long been conceptually linked to experiences of emotion and mind wandering, yet these empirical relationships remain unclear, and few studies have explored the thoughts and emotions of creative people in daily life. To investigate how creativity relates to everyday cognitive and affective experiences, the present study (N = 159) used experience sampling to examine how creative cognition (divergent thinking ability) and creative behavior (self-reported creative activity and achievement) measured in the lab may predict thought content, affective state, and the frequency of mind wandering (i.e., task-unrelated thought) in daily life. Additionally, we assessed in-the-moment thoughts and emotions predictive of thinking about a creative project in everyday life (i.e., "creative project thought "). We found that each form of creativity was generally associated with positively-valenced experiences, such as having pleasant thoughts, enjoying one's everyday activities, and feeling motivated and inspired. We also found that positive, activating emotions (happy and energetic) were positively associated with divergent thinking ability and in-the-moment creative project thought. Furthermore, positive, deactivating emotions (relaxed and connected) negatively predicted momentary creative project thought-indicating that positive affect can be tied to less creative thinking, depending on the activation level of emotions. No relationship was found between daily-life mind wandering frequency and divergent thinking ability or creative behavior/achievement, suggesting that the overall amount of task-unrelated thought in everyday life is not related to individual creativity. Taken together, the present findings provide novel evidence on the everyday experiential correlates of creative thinking and behavior.

AB Using preliminary observations from three parallel projects that employ a range of methods (network and content analysis, surveys, focus groups, and interviews), this article traces the experience of navigating different kinds of identity as useful capital within the legal profession. Identity is not the first kind of non-economic capital to influence professional navigation, but it is distinct in that it is owned and deployed primarily by minority actors. Adding to scholarship that has located the extensions for identity as capital, three interrelated contributions follow from this research. First, it reveals the prevalence of a diffuse field of diversity consciousness where, regardless of outcome, there is a sense that diversity is useful capital. Second, despite being notionally useful, these multi-method sources reveal the ways in which navigating such capital is simultaneously complicated for both actors within visible (e.g. race and perceived gender) and invisible (e.g. some disability, genderfluidity, and religion) identity categories. The isomorphic diversity posturing by organizations fosters a system where being a minority is seen as an advantage, but inclusion feels like accommodation either because it demands certain portrayals of precarity or because it leaves individuals unsure of their worth beyond the expected performance of their identity. As a result, even though the new version of the ideal professional norm might valorize identity as capital, it continues to serve organizations rather than individuals. Finally, these data make the methodological case for the usefulness of the periphery as an analytical vantage point to assess systemic inequalities in legal profession research.

TI RASCBEC: Raman spectroscopy calculation via born effective charge
SO COMPUTER PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
ID TOTAL-ENERGY CALCULATIONS; SPECTRA; INTENSITIES
AB We present a reformulated algorithm for ab initio calculations of Raman spectra for large systems by applying an external electric field, and complement it by a code implementation we name RASCBEC. With the RASCBEC code, we have successfully benchmark crystalline materials and compute Raman spectra of large molecules, and amorphous oxides. Our results demonstrate a remarkable level of agreement with the results from other commonly used codes as well as the experimental data. The electric field approach for Raman spectra calculation is designed to overcome the computational challenges associated with the conventional method, which requires calculating the macroscopic dielectric tensor at numerous molecular geometries. This approach is favored because it can significantly reduce computational time. We reformulated this method by obtaining the Raman intensity from the first-order derivative of the Born Effective Charge (BEC), which is computed directly from VASP (the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package). This differs from other electric field-based methods that calculate Raman intensities as the second-order derivative of force with respect to the electric field. By reducing the order of derivatives, we can avoid numerical noise and accuracy concerns. Additionally, since forces are often very small numbers, taking the derivative of BEC is numerically more stable, allowing our method to be applied to a broader range of material parameters. This advantage makes RASCBEC particularly beneficial for large molecules and extensive amorphous systems.

AB Teaching is one of many professions for which personalized feedback and reflection can help improve dialogue and discussion between the professional and those they serve. However, professional development (PD) is often impersonal as human observation is labor-intensive. Data-driven PD tools in teaching are of growing interest, but open questions about how professionals engage with their data in practice remain. In this paper, we present ClassInSight, a tool that visualizes three levels of teachers' discussion data and structures reflection. Through 22 reflection sessions and interviews with 5 high school science teachers, we found themes related to dissonance, contextualization, and sustainability in how teachers engaged with their data in the tool and in how their professional vision, the use of professional expertise to interpret events, shifted over time. We discuss guidelines for these conversational support tools to support personalized PD in professions beyond teaching where conversation and interaction are important.

AB In this paper, we study the evolution of the X5.4 flare (SOL2012-03-07T00:02) in NOAA Active Region 11429, focusing on its initiation mechanisms and back-reaction effects. To help our study, three-dimensional (3D) coronal magnetic field models are extrapolated from the photospheric magnetograms of the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory under the assumptions of nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) and non-force-free field (non-FFF). We investigate the 3D magnetic structure and MHD kink instability, torus instability, and double-arc instability (DAI), and find that this flare is most likely triggered by the tether-cutting reconnection and the subsequent DAI. For the back-reactions of the flare, both NLFFF and non-FFF models clearly show an increase in horizontal magnetic field (B ( h )) and a decrease in inclination angle (phi) of the magnetic field near the polarity inversion line, from the photosphere up to a certain height (5 Mm and 8 Mm for non-FFF and NLFFF, respectively). In addition, the non-FFF model shows an enhancement of the downward Lorentz force acting on the photosphere, and the location of the enhancement spatially coincides with the location of the flare onset. The observed back-reaction is likely a consequence of magnetic reconnection.

AB Fairness is a growing concern in machine learning as state-of-the-art models may amplify social prejudice by making biased predictions against specific demographics such as race and gender. Such discrimination raises issues in various fields such as employment, criminal justice, and trust score evaluation. To address the concerns, we propose learning fair representation through a straightforward yet effective approach to project intrinsic information while filtering sensitive information for downstream tasks. Our model consists of two goals: one is to ensure that the latent data from different demographic groups is nonseparable (i.e., make the latent data distribution independent of the sensitive feature to improve fairness); the other is to maximize the separability of latent data from different classes (i.e., maintain the discriminative power of data for the sake of the downstream tasks like classification). Our method adopts a non-zero-sum adversarial game to minimize the distance between data from different demographic groups while maximizing the margin between data from different classes. Moreover, the proposed objective function can be easily generalized to multiple sensitive attributes and multi-class scenarios as it upper bounds popular fairness metrics in these cases. We provide theoretical analysis of the fairness of our model and validate w.r.t. both fairness and predictive performance on benchmark datasets.

ID RECONSTRUCTION
AB In 1-bit compressed sensing, the aim is to estimate a k-sparse unit vector x is an element of Sn-1 within an epsilon error (in l(2)) from minimal number of linear measurements that are quantized to just their signs, i.e., from measurements of the form y = sign(< a, x >). In this paper, we study a noisy version where a fraction of the measurements can be flipped, potentially by an adversary. In particular, we analyze the Binary Iterative Hard Thresholding (BIHT) algorithm, a proximal gradient descent on a properly defined loss function used for 1-bit compressed sensing, in this noisy setting. It is known from recent results that, with (O) over tilde (k/epsilon) noiseless measurements, BIHT provides an estimate within. error. This result is optimal and universal, meaning one set of measurements work for all sparse vectors. In this paper, we show that BIHT also provides better results than all known methods for the noisy setting. We show that when up to tau-fraction of the sign measurements are incorrect (adversarial error), with the same number of measurements as before, BIHT agnostically provides an estimate of x within an (O) over tilde(epsilon + t) error, maintaining the universality of measurements. This establishes stability of iterative hard thresholding in the presence of measurement error. To obtain the result, we use the restricted approximate invertibility of Gaussian matrices, as well as a tight analysis of the high-dimensional geometry of the adversarially corrupted measurements.

ID PARITY-TIME SYMMETRY
AB Physically unclonable functions (PUFs) are a class of hardware-specific security primitives based on secret keys extracted from integrated circuits, which can protect important information against cyberattacks and reverse engineering. Here, we put forward an emerging type of PUF in the electromagnetic domain by virtue of the self-dual absorber-emitter singularity that uniquely exists in the non-Hermitian parity-time (PT)-symmetric structures. At this self-dual singular point, the reconfigurable emissive and absorptive properties with order-of-magnitude differences in scattered power can respond sensitively to admittance or phase perturbations caused by, for example, manufacturing imperfectness. Consequently, the entropy sourced from inevitable manufacturing variations can be amplified, yielding excellent PUF security metrics in terms of randomness and uniqueness. We show that this electromagnetic PUF can be robust against machine learning-assisted attacks based on the Fourier regression and generative adversarial network. Moreover, the proposed PUF concept is wavelength-scalable in radio frequency, terahertz, infrared, and optical systems, paving a promising avenue toward applications of cryptography and encryption.

TI Generating Photospheric Vector Magnetograms of Solar Active Regions for
   SOHO/MDI Using SDO/HMI and BBSO Data with Deep Learning

AB Solar activity is often caused by the evolution of solar magnetic fields. Magnetic field parameters derived from photospheric vector magnetograms of solar active regions (ARs) have been used to analyze and forecast eruptive events, such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections. Unfortunately, the most recent Solar Cycle 24 was relatively weak with few large flares, though it is the only solar cycle in which consistent time-sequence vector magnetograms have been available through the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) since its launch in 2010. In this work, we look into another major instrument, namely the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) from 1996 to 2010. The data archive of SOHO/MDI covers a more active Solar Cycle 23 with many large flares. However, SOHO/MDI only has line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms. We propose a new deep learning method, named MagNet, to learn from combined LOS magnetograms, Bx and By, taken by SDO/HMI, along with Ha observations collected by the Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO), and to generate synthetic vector components B'(x) and B'(y) of ARs. These generated vector components, together with observational LOS data, would form vector magnetograms for SOHO/MDI. In this way, we can expand the availability of vector magnetograms to the period from 1996 to present. Experimental results demonstrate the good performance of the MagNet method. To our knowledge, this is the first time that deep learning has been used to generate photospheric vector magnetograms of ARs for SOHO/MDI using SDO/HMI and Ha data.

AB The inference of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) is crucial to understanding the regulatory mechanisms that govern biological processes. GRNs may be represented as edges in a graph, and hence, it have been inferred computationally for scRNA-seq data. A wisdom of crowds approach to integrate edges from several GRNs to create one composite GRN has demonstrated improved performance when compared with individual algorithm implementations on bulk RNA-seq and microarray data. In an effort to extend this approach to scRNA-seq data, we present COFFEE (COnsensus single cell-type speciFic inFerence for gEnE regulatory networks), a Borda voting-based consensus algorithm that integrates information from 10 established GRN inference methods. We conclude that COFFEE has improved performance across synthetic, curated, and experimental datasets when compared with baseline methods. Additionally, we show that a modified version of COFFEE can be leveraged to improve performance on newer cell-type specific GRN inference methods. Overall, our results demonstrate that consensus-based methods with pertinent modifications continue to be valuable for GRN inference at the single cell level. While COFFEE is benchmarked on 10 algorithms, it is a flexible strategy that can incorporate any set of GRN inference algorithms according to user preference. A Python implementation of COFFEE may be found on GitHub: https://github.com/lodimk2/coffee

AB NafionTM utilizes-SO3H 3 H groups for proton conduction. Using an alternative proton-exchange functionality like-PO3H2, 3 H 2 ,-COOH, etc., to replace-SO3H 3 H in ion conductive fluoropolymers has attracted significant attention. For example, composite membranes comprising NafionTM and perfluoro(carboxylic acid) bearing a-COOH group on its side chains have been used in color-alkali cells to reduce unwanted electrolyte crossovers. In the present paper, we reported a new synthetic strategy for constructing novel -PO3H2-bearing 3 H 2-bearing fluoropolymers (FBP). Our method employs a ZnI2-promoted 2-promoted phosphorylation reaction of triethyl phosphite that converts benzyl alcohol on a side chain of a fluoropolymer into a benzylphosphodiester group, followed by trimethylsilyl chloride (TMSCl) hydrolysis to yield FBP. This strategy has enabled us to graft a fluoropolymer side chain directly with phosphonic acid. Although the in-plane proton conductivities of FBP fluoropolymers are lower than those of NafionTM 115, most FBPs, especially Homo-FBP that has no fluoroalkyl ether group on its side chains, are significantly more stable against hydroxyl radical degradations in Fenton tests. This paper presents a new method for the synthesis of -PO3H2-containing 3 H 2-containing fluoropolymers and our work also confirms a novel strategy for enhancing the long-term stability of a proton-conductive fluoropolymer in electrical devices-eliminating or reducing fluoroalkyl ether groups on the side chains of the polymer.

ID OPERATORS
AB This article shows that for a large class of discrete periodic Schrodinger operators, most wavefunctions resemble Bloch states. More precisely, we prove quantum ergodicity for a family of periodic Schrodinger operators H on periodic graphs. This means that most eigenfunctions of H on large finite periodic graphs are equidistributed in some sense, hence delocalized. Our results cover the adjacency matrix on Z(d), the triangular lattice, the honeycomb lattice, Cartesian products, and periodic Schrodinger operators on Z(d). The theorem applies more generally to any periodic Schrodinger operator satisfying an assumption on the Floquet eigenvalues.

AB Support for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) is a major use case of 5G networks. Due to their large from factors, CAVs can be equipped with multiple radio antennas, cameras, LiDAR and other sensors. In other words, they are "giant" mobile integrated communications and sensing devices. The data collected can not only facilitate edge-assisted autonomous driving, but also enable intelligent radio resource allocation by cellular networks. In this paper we conduct an initial study to assess the feasibility of delivering multi-modal sensory data collected by vehicles over emerging commercial 5G networks. We carried out an "in-the-wild" drive test and data collection campaign between Minneapolis and Chicago using a vehicle equipped with a 360 degrees camera, a LiDAR device, multiple smart phones and a professional 5G network measurement tool. Using the collected multi-modal data, we conduct trace-driven experiments in a local streaming testbed to analyze the requirements and performance of streaming multi-modal sensor data over existing 4G/5G networks. We reveal several notable findings and point out future research directions.

AB Extended reality (XR) is at the center of attraction in the research community due to the emergence of augmented, mixed, and virtual reality applications. The performance of such applications needs to be uptight to maintain the requirements of latency, energy consumption, and freshness of data. Therefore, a comprehensive performance analysis model is required to assess the effectiveness of an XR application but is challenging to design due to the dependence of the performance metrics on several difficult-to-model parameters, such as computing resources and hardware utilization of XR and edge devices, which are controlled by both their operating systems and the application itself. Moreover, the heterogeneity in devices and wireless access networks brings additional challenges in modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel modeling framework for performance analysis of XR applications considering edge-assisted wireless networks and validate the model with experimental data collected from testbeds designed specifically for XR applications. In addition, we present the challenges associated with performance analysis modeling and present methods to overcome them in detail. Finally, the performance evaluation shows that the proposed analytical model can analyze XR applications' performance with high accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art analytical models.

AB Thermodynamics is a science concerning the state of a system, whether it is stable, metastable, or unstable, when interacting with its surroundings. The combined law of thermodynamics derived by Gibbs about 150 years ago laid the foundation of thermodynamics. In Gibbs combined law, the entropy production due to internal processes was not included, and the 2nd law was thus practically removed from the Gibbs combined law, so it is only applicable to systems under equilibrium, thus commonly termed as equilibrium or Gibbs thermodynamics. Gibbs further derived the classical statistical thermodynamics in terms of the probability of configu-rations in a system in the later 1800's and early 1900's. With the quantum mechanics (QM) developed in 1920's, the QM-based statistical thermodynamics was established and connected to classical statistical thermodynamics at the classical limit as shown by Landau in the 1940's. In 1960's the development of density functional theory (DFT) by Kohn and co-workers enabled the QM prediction of properties of the ground state of a system. On the other hand, the entropy production due to internal processes in non-equilibrium systems was studied separately by Onsager in 1930's and Prigogine and co-workers in the 1950's. In 1960's to 1970's the digitization of thermodynamics was developed by Kaufman in the framework of the CALculation of PHAse Diagrams (CALPHAD) modeling of individual phases with internal degrees of freedom. CALPHAD modeling of thermodynamics and atomic transport properties has enabled computational design of complex materials in the last 50 years. Our recently termed zentropy theory integrates DFT and statistical mechanics through the replacement of the internal energy of each individual configuration by its DFT-predicted free energy. The zentropy theory is capable of accurately predicting the free energy of individual phases, transition temperatures and properties of magnetic and ferroelectric materials with free energies of individual configurations solely from DFT-based calculations and without fitting pa-rameters, and is being tested for other phenomena including superconductivity, quantum criticality, and black holes. Those predictions include the singularity at critical points with divergence of physical properties, negative thermal expansion, and the strongly correlated physics. Those individual configurations may thus be considered as the genomic building blocks of individual phases in the spirit of the materials genome (R). This has the potential to shift the paradigm of CALPHAD modeling from being heavily dependent on experimental inputs to becoming fully predictive with inputs solely from DFT-based calculations and machine learning models built on those calculations and existing experimental data through newly developed and future open-source tools. Furthermore, through the combined law of thermodynamics including the internal entropy production, it is shown that the kinetic coefficient matrix of independent internal processes is diagonal with respect to the conjugate potentials in the combined law, and the cross phenomena that the phenomenological Onsager flux and reciprocal relationships are due to the dependence of the conjugate potential of a molar quantity on nonconjugate molar quantities and other potentials, which can be predicted by the zentropy theory and CALPHAD modeling.

AB Leveraging the Remote Hub Lab (RHL/RHLab) research group's work on democratizing educational access, RHLab, in partnership with LabsLand, has developed the Remote Engineering Lab for Inclusive Access (RELIA/RHL-RELIA). This initiative introduces an educational tool specifically designed for communication courses, aiming to promote learning experiences in technical education. RHL-RELIA, built upon Software Defined Radio (SDR) technology, offers a novel approach to manipulating radio-frequency (RF) hardware through programming, aiming to promote the learning experience in wireless communication. This study presents an initial evaluation of RHL-RELIA post its development, focusing on its usability and educational impact, particularly for students with limited experience in RF technology. The assessment involved three engineering students testing the system, providing feedback on its interface design and effectiveness in facilitating remote experimentation. The preliminary findings suggest that RHLRELIA is successful in improving the efficiency of completing assignments and making complex wireless concepts more accessible. Future work will include a comprehensive evaluation of RHL-RELIA within a classroom environment, involving a more diverse student population to assess its adaptability and overall educational impact. Future studies will employ mixed methods, including surveys and interviews, to gain a deeper understanding of RHL-RELIA's role in enhancing engineering education.

ID REGISTRATION; FRAMEWORK
AB This paper presents a novel predictive model, MetaMorph, for metamorphic registration of images with appearance changes (i.e., caused by brain tumors). In contrast to previous learning-based registration methods that have little or no control over appearance-changes, our model introduces a new regularization that can effectively suppress the negative effects of appearance changing areas. In particular, we develop a piecewise regularization on the tangent space of diffeomorphic transformations (also known as initial velocity fields) via learned segmentation maps of abnormal regions. The geometric transformation and appearance changes are treated as joint tasks that are mutually beneficial. Our model MetaMorph is more robust and accurate when searching for an optimal registration solution under the guidance of segmentation, which in turn improves the segmentation performance by providing appropriately augmented training labels. We validate MetaMorph on real 3D human brain tumor magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Experimental results show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art learning-based registration models. The proposed MetaMorph has great potential in various image-guided clinical interventions, e.g., real-time image-guided navigation systems for tumor removal surgery.

ID REDOX-CONTROLLED CHALCOGEN; BASIS-SETS
AB Our interest in the design of heavy pnictogen-based Lewis acids for anion trafficking across biological membrane mimics has led us to investigate trivalent bismuthenium cations as chloride anion transporters. Here, we describe two chlorodiarylbismuthines, elaborated on a peri-substituted naphthalene backbone and stabilized by an adjacent thio- or seleno-ether functionality that engages the bismuth center in a Ch -> Bi interaction (Ch=chalcogen). These new derivatives are stable in aqueous environment and readiliy transport chloride anions across the membrane of phospholipid-based vesicles loaded with KCl. In addition to establishing the use of such motifs in anion transport, this investigation shows that the Lewis acidity, lipophilicity, and thus chloride transport properties depend on the nature of the chalcogen.
   The search for main group derivatives that mediate chloride transport across phospholipid bilayers has led to the identification of chalcogen-supported diarylbismuthenium cations as suitable examples of such compounds. Deploying these water-stable cations in chloride-loaded vesicles shows that their transport properties can be adjusted by the strength of the chalcogen -> bismuth interaction, as well as the overall lipophilicity of their structures. image

AB Image classification in remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) data containing various land cover classes is essential for efficient and sustainable land use estimation and other tasks like object detection, localization, and segmentation. Deep learning (DL) techniques have shown tremendous potential in the GIS domain. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have dominated image analysis, transformers have proven to be a unifying solution for several AI-based processing pipelines. Vision transformers (ViTs) can have comparable and, in some cases, better accuracy than a CNN. However, they suffer from a significant drawback associated with the excessive use of training parameters. Using trainable parameters generously can have multiple advantages ranging from addressing model scalability to explainability. This can have a significant impact on model deployment in edge devices with limited resources, such as drones. In this research, we explore, without using pre-trained weights, how the inherent structure of vision transformers behaves with custom modifications. To verify our proposed approach, these architectures are trained on multiple land cover datasets. Experiments reveal that a combination of lightweight convolutional layers, including ShuffleNet, along with depthwise separable convolutions and average pooling can reduce the trainable parameters by 17.85% and yet achieve higher accuracy than the base mobile vision transformer (MViT). It is also observed that utilizing a combination of convolution layers along with multi-headed self-attention layers in MViT variants provides better performance for capturing local and global features, unlike the standalone ViT architecture, which utilizes almost 95% more parameters than the proposed MViT variant.

ID FUNCTIONALIZATION
AB The synthesis and application of multifunctional diazirine-containing polymers for on-demand cross-linking of unfunctionalized commodity polymers through C-H bond insertion is demonstrated. While small-molecule diazirine cross-linkers have seen important applications such as plastic compatibilization and photopatterning, the high degree of functionalization of polymer-based diazirine cross-linkers offers promise for enhanced compatibility based on polymer blending and increased efficiency due to controllable multivalency. As a demonstrative example, unfunctionalized linear poly(n-butyl acrylate) (PnBA) can be cross-linked using various polymeric cross-linkers with diazirine contents as low as 0.8 wt % in 1 min under photochemical conditions. With gel fractions up to 95%, tunable rheological behavior is observed with increasing cross-linker loadings, consistent with a transition from entangled branched polymers to a cross-linked network. Moreover, the synthetic stability of the diazirine units can be exploited to prepare diazirine-containing polymers based on a variety of different backbones, from vinyl copolymers to poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), which allows successful photopatterning using a commercial 3D printer.

AB Spatial Orchestra demonstrates how easy it is to play musical instruments using basic input like natural locomotion, which is accessible to most. Unlike many musical instruments, our work allows individuals of all skill levels to effortlessly create music by walking into virtual bubbles. Our Augmented Reality experience involves interacting with ever-shifting sound bubbles that the user engages with by stepping into color-coded bubbles within the assigned area using a standalone AR headset. Each bubble corresponds to a cello note, and omits sound from the center of the bubble, and lets the user hear and express in spatial audio, effectively transforming participants into musicians. This interactive element enables users to explore the intersection of spatial awareness, musical rhythm that extends to bodily expression through playful movements and dance-like gestures within the bubble-filled environment. This unique experience illuminates the intricate relationship between spatial awareness and the art of musical performance.

AB Research Highlight: Hoenle, P. O., Staab, M., Donoso, D. A., Argoti, A., & Bluthgen, N. (2023). Stratification and recovery time jointly shape ant functional reassembly in a neotropical forest. Journal of Animal Ecology, https://doi.org/10.1111/13652656.13896. Space, time and abiotic variation are primary axes across investigations of community ecology and disturbed ecosystems offer tractable systems for assessing their relative impact. While recovering forests can act as isolated case studies in understanding community assembly, it is not well understood how individual micro habitats respond to recovery and ultimately shape community attributes. Hoenle et al. (2023) leverage the ubiquity and microhabitat-specific diversity of ants across a gradient from active agricultural sites to old-growth forest and assess how recovery and stratification together shape communities. The authors find distinct stratification across phylogenetic, functional and trait diversity as forest recovery time increases, while also recovering unique recovery trajectories contingent on trait sampling. While stratified, phylogenetic and functional diversity did not increase along this recovery gradient. Ten out of 13 sampled traits were jointly influenced by both stratification and recovery time. In contrast to intuitive predictions, a majority of trait means converged throughout the recovery period. Results highlight the multifaceted nature of recovery based community assembly and the capacity of multidimensional sampling to uncover surprising patterns in ecologically diverse lineages.

AB Research in open quantum system dynamics has received growing interest in recent years, and its ongoing investigation has uncovered many intriguing physics departing from closed systems. A particularly useful application of the open quantum system theory is to simulate quantum dynamical processes in condensed phase materials. As the quantum degree of freedom is constantly under the influence of its thermal environment, the accurate description of the dynamics often requires non-Markovian time evolution at finite temperature. Such calculation is usually quite challenging on classical computers as extensive memory storage is required. In this work, we focus on a quantum system linearly coupled to its harmonic bath and present a path integral based quantum algorithm that time -evolves the reduced density matrix under finite temperature non-Markovian dynamics. To treat the nonunitary time evolution, the Sz.-Nagy dilation scheme is used for the conversion to unitary dynamics that can be implementable on gate -based quantum computers. The modified Hadamard test is then used to retrieve all the information of the reduced density matrix. Complexity analysis shows that the memory requirement has exponential reduction on the quantum machine whereas the runtime complexity stays roughly the same as for the classical computer. It points to the possibility of using this algorithm to simulate multilevel and multisite non-Markovian quantum dynamics that are beyond the reach of classical computers. The algorithm makes no ad hoc assumptions and extends naturally beyond Markovian and weak coupling regimes. We validated the algorithm on the quantum simulator with the spin -boson model and demonstrated its excellent agreement with the classical computer benchmark.

AB Accurately localizing 1-D signal patterns, such as Gamma-ray well-log depth matching, is crucial in the oilfield service industry as it directly affects the quality of oil and gas exploration. However, traditional methods such as well-log curve analysis and pattern hand-picking matching are labor-intensive and heavily rely on human expertise, leading to inconsistent results. Although attempts have been made to automate this process, challenges such as low computational performance, nonrobustness, and nongeneralization remain unsolved. To address these challenges, we have developed a data-driven AI system that learns an active signal pattern localization strategy inspired by human attention. Our artificial intelligence system uses an offline reinforcement learning (RL) framework as its central component, which solves a highly abstracted Markov decision process (MDP) problem via offline training on human-labeled historical data. The RL agent uses top-down reasoning to determine the location of target signal fragments by deforming a bounding window using simple transformation actions. To overcome distribution shifts between logged data and real and ensure generalization, we propose a discrete distributionally robust soft actor-critic (SAC) RL framework (DRSAC-Discrete) to solve the MDP problem under uncertainty. By exploring unfamiliar environments in a restrictive manner, the DRSAC-Discrete algorithm provides a safe solution that can be used when data is limited during the early stage of this industrial application. We evaluated the RL-based localization system on augmented field Gamma-ray well-log datasets, and the results showed promising localization capability. Furthermore, the DRSAC-Discrete algorithm demonstrated relatively robust performance guarantees when facing data shortage.

AB Fairness is becoming a rising concern in machine learning. Recent research has discovered that state-of-the-art models are amplifying social bias by making biased prediction towards some population groups (characterized by sensitive features like race or gender). Such unfair prediction among groups renders trust issues and ethical concerns in machine learning, especially for sensitive fields such as employment, criminal justice, and trust score assessment. In this paper, we introduce a new framework to improve machine learning fairness. The goal of our model is to minimize the influence of sensitive feature from the perspectives of both data input and predictive model. To achieve this goal, we reformulate the data input by eliminating the sensitive information and strengthen model fairness by minimizing the marginal contribution of the sensitive feature. We propose to learn the sensitive-irrelevant input via sampling among features and design an adversarial network to minimize the dependence between the reformulated input and the sensitive information. Empirical results validate that our model achieves comparable or better results than related state-of-the-art methods w.r.t. both fairness metrics and prediction performance.

AB Deep neural networks are powerful tools to detect hidden patterns in data and leverage them to make predictions, but they are not designed to understand uncertainty and estimate reliable probabilities. In particular, they tend to be overconfident. We begin to address this problem in the context of multi-class classification by developing a novel training algorithm producing models with more dependable uncertainty estimates, without sacrificing predictive power. The idea is to mitigate overconfidence by minimizing a loss function, inspired by advances in conformal inference, that quantifies model uncertainty by carefully leveraging hold-out data. Experiments with synthetic and real data demonstrate this method can lead to smaller conformal prediction sets with higher conditional coverage, after exact calibration with hold-out data, compared to state-of-the-art alternatives.

AB The noise produced in demolition sites can mask safety-critical sounds that inform operators about task conditions and hazards. These problems are exacerbated in teleoperated demolition, where the separation between operator and site compromises operators' situation awareness and cognitive loads. This paper assessed the effects of environmental sounds with and without attenuation on the operators' performance and response (e.g., stress, attention, task engagement) during teleoperated demolition. Eighty participants completed three virtual demolition tasks under different environmental sound conditions, i.e., no sound (NS), unfiltered sound (US), and filtered sound (FS) with 20-dB attenuation of background noise and robot's sounds to allow focus on safety and task conditions. The results show that US induced more stress than NS and FS. Also, FS resulted in fewer collisions, faster reaction times, and greater attention and task engagement than US. These results can support the design of sound feedback interfaces for teleoperation in construction.

AB Educational remote laboratories, dedicated to radio frequency (RF) communications, represent an innovative effort aimed at bridging the gap between theory and practice. This advancement is even more empowered by the advent of Software-Defined Radio (SDR) technology, which allows students to create a wide array of prototypes for RF communication systems. The SDR community provides highly adaptable hardware that can be easily customized with just a few lines of code. Additionally, the availability of SDR hardware is extensive, offering various features tailored to users' specific needs. One of the key advantages of the flexibility inherent in SDR technology is the shared libraries among its devices. This feature fosters interoperability which is the ability of different SDR devices or components to work together effectively. In this context, the Remote Hub Lab (RHL/RHLab) has been working to incorporate this functionality into the RHL-RELIA remote lab project. RHL-RELIA stands as a remote wireless communication lab, with its initial iteration based on the ADALM-PLUTO SDR. However, as it evolves, RHL-RELIA is incorporating other SDR devices, such as the Red Pitaya, which introduces unique features not found in the ADALM-PLUTO. This degree of diversification empowers students with a broad spectrum of choices, allowing them to select the SDR device that aligns most closely with their individual interests and educational requirements.

TI Field inversion machine learning augmented turbulence modeling for
   time-accurate unsteady flow
SO PHYSICS OF FLUIDS
LA English
DT Article
ID DROPLETS
AB Field inversion machine learning (FIML) has the advantages of model consistency and low data dependency and has been used to augment imperfect turbulence models. However, the solver-intrusive field inversion has a high entry bar, and existing FIML studies focused on improving only steady-state or time-averaged periodic flow predictions. To break this limit, this paper develops an open-source FIML framework for time-accurate unsteady flow, where both spatial and temporal variations of flow are of interest. We augment a Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) turbulence model's production term with a scalar field. We then integrate a neural network (NN) model into the flow solver to compute the above augmentation scalar field based on local flow features at each time step. Finally, we optimize the weights and biases of the built-in NN model to minimize the regulated spatial-temporal prediction error between the augmented flow solver and reference data. We consider the spatial-temporal evolution of unsteady flow over a 45 degrees ramp and use only the surface pressure as the training data. The unsteady-FIML-trained model accurately predicts the spatial-temporal variations of unsteady flow fields. In addition, the trained model exhibits reasonably good prediction accuracy for various ramp angles, Reynolds numbers, and flow variables (e.g., velocity fields) that are not used in training, highlighting its generalizability. The FIML capability has been integrated into our open-source framework DAFoam. It has the potential to train more accurate RANS turbulence models for other unsteady flow phenomena, such as wind gust response, bubbly flow, and particle dispersion in the atmosphere.

TI Energy Management and Economic Considerations of Intermittent

AB As the energy sector shifts from fossil fuels to renewable energy, there is a need for long-duration energy storage solutions to handle the intermittency of renewable electricity. Electrofuels, or fuels synthesized from excess electricity, are an emerging medium poised to meet long-duration energy storage requirements. Ammonia as an electrofuel is potentially ideal because ammonia has a relatively low liquefaction pressure, indicating that ammonia can be easily stored and transported. Here, we develop a framework to optimize the electrochemical production of ammonia powered by intermittent photovoltaic power. We also explore various buyback policies to understand the impact that policy has on the cost of intermittent ammonia and optimal sizing ratios. The optimal ratio of the photovoltaic to the electrolyzer is similar to 3.7 MWPV/MWELEC for a system that is completely powered by renewable photovoltaic power and operates intermittently. The optimal ratio of the photovoltaic to the electrolyzer is similar to 3.3 MWPV/MWELEC for a system that uses photovoltaics in conjunction with grid electricity and operates continuously. For the purchase price at the avoided cost of electricity, the optimal ratio of the solar panel to the electrolyzer increases to similar to 4 MWPV/MWELEC for a system that can only sell to the grid and similar to 5 MWPV/MWELEC for a system that can buy and sell electricity to the grid at the avoided cost. Optimizing energy management by setting auxiliary battery size limits is essential to reducing ammonia costs, and the optimal battery size decreases as the buyback price of electricity increases. Finally, we find that systems connected to the grid and operating continuously have emissions comparable to the Haber-Bosch process because of the current emissions tied to the United States electricity generation. Thus, unless the grid is completely decarbonized, it is essential to create electrofuels that rely minimally on grid electricity.

AB Let pi n be a uniformly chosen random permutation on [n]. Using an analysis of the probability that two overlapping consecutive k-permutations are order isomorphic, the authors of [2] showed that the expected number of distinct consecutive patterns of all lengths k is an element of {1, 2, ... , n} in pi n is n22 (1 - o(1)) as n -> infinity. This exhibited the fact that random permutations pack consecutive patterns near-perfectly. We use entirely different methods, namely the Stein-Chen method of Poisson approximation, to reprove and slightly improve their result.

AB Solar flares, especially the M- and X-class flares, are often associated with coronal mass ejections. They are the most important sources of space weather effects, which can severely impact the near-Earth environment. Thus it is essential to forecast flares (especially the M- and X-class ones) to mitigate their destructive and hazardous consequences. Here, we introduce several statistical and machine-learning approaches to the prediction of an active region's (AR) flare index (FI) that quantifies the flare productivity of an AR by taking into account the number of different class flares within a certain time interval. Specifically, our sample includes 563 ARs that appeared on the solar disk from 2010 May to 2017 December. The 25 magnetic parameters, provided by the Space-weather HMI Active Region Patches (SHARP) from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory, characterize coronal magnetic energy stored in ARs by proxy and are used as the predictors. We investigate the relationship between these SHARP parameters and the FI of ARs with a machine-learning algorithm (spline regression) and the resampling method (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique for Regression with Gaussian Noise). Based on the established relationship, we are able to predict the value of FIs for a given AR within the next 1 day period. Compared with other four popular machine-learning algorithms, our methods improve the accuracy of FI prediction, especially for a large FI. In addition, we sort the importance of SHARP parameters by the Borda count method calculated from the ranks that are rendered by nine different machine-learning methods.

AB Accurate computational simulations of protein-glycan dynamics are crucial for a comprehensive understanding of critical biological mechanisms, including host-pathogen interactions, immune system defenses, and intercellular communication. The accuracy of these simulations, including molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and alchemical free energy calculations, critically relies on the appropriate parameters, including the water model, because of the extensive hydrogen bonding with glycan hydroxyl groups. However, a systematic evaluation of water models' accuracy in simulating protein-glycan interaction at the molecular level is still lacking. In this study, we used full atomistic MD simulations and alchemical absolute binding free energy (ABFE) calculations to investigate the performance of five distinct water models in six protein-glycan complex systems. We evaluated water models' impact on structural dynamics and binding affinity through over 5.8 mu s of simulation time per system. Our results reveal that most protein-glycan complexes are stable in the overall structural dynamics regardless of the water model used, while some show obvious fluctuations with specific water models. More importantly, we discover that the stability of the binding motif's conformation is dependent on the water model chosen when its residues form weak hydrogen bonds with the glycan. The water model also influences the conformational stability of the glycan in its bound state according to density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Using alchemical ABFE calculations, we find that the OPC water model exhibits exceptional consistency with experimental binding affinity data, whereas commonly used models such as TIP3P are less accurate. The findings demonstrate how different water models affect protein-glycan interactions and the accuracy of binding affinity calculations, which is crucial in developing therapeutic strategies targeting these interactions.

AB We present first-principles calculations of Schottky barrier heights at interfaces relevant for silicon-based merged-element transmon qubit devices. Focusing on Al(111)/Si(111) and CoSi2(111)/Si(111), we consider various possible interfacial structures, for which we study the relaxations of the atoms near the interface, calculate the formation energies and Schottky barrier heights, and provide estimates of the Josephson critical currents based on the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) tunneling formalism as implemented in the Simmons/TsuEsaki model. We find that the formation energies and SBHs are very similar for all Al(111)/Si(111) structures, yet vary significantly for the CoSi2(111)/Si(111) structures. We attribute this to the more covalent character of bonding at CoSi2/Si, which leads to configurations with distinct atomic and electronic structure. Our estimated Josephson critical currents, which govern the behavior of merged-element transmons, provide insight into the trends as a function of Schottky-barrier height. We show that desirable qubit frequencies of 4-5 GHz can be obtained with a Si barrier thickness of about 5-10 nm, and demonstrate that the critical current density as a function of Schottky barrier height can be modeled based on the tunneling probability for a rectangular barrier.

AB Software-Defined Radio (SDR) remote labs permit students to experiment with real wireless communication, designing Radio Frequency (RF) systems with minimal code adjustments. This feature allows them to create RF prototypes remotely in a fast way allowing them to complement their theory of communication classes. While SDR hardware suffices for most basic applications, some demand extensive Signal Processing stages that surpass the capabilities of standard SDR equipment. SDR devices are controlled by reprogrammable digital logic devices like FPGA which have some limitations in terms of capabilities/price factor. For this case Partial Reconfiguration (PR) emerges as a solution, leveraging to use the resources of these devices more efficiently. In the conventional approach, modifying FPGA designs required users to undertake the laborious process of resynthesizing, implementing, and programming the entire FPGA. Consequently, this procedure is time-consuming and impedes users' progress. However, with partial reconfiguration, users only need to resynthesize and program the specific portions or slices of the FPGA that necessitate modification. However, it necessitates a specialized understanding of FPGA design, involving the creation of modifiable regions. This paper takes initial strides towards establishing a remote laboratory for students to explore wireless communication concepts, harnessing PR for SDR devices.

ID DIFFEOMORPHIC IMAGE REGISTRATION; FRAMEWORK
AB This paper presents NeurEPDiff, a novel network to fast predict the geodesics in deformation spaces generated by a well known Euler-Poincare differential equation (EPDiff). To achieve this, we develop a neural operator that for the first time learns the evolving trajectory of geodesic deformations parameterized in the tangent space of diffeomorphisms (a.k.a velocity fields). In contrast to previous methods that purely fit the training images, our proposed NeurEPDiff learns a nonlinear mapping function between the time-dependent velocity fields. A composition of integral operators and smooth activation functions is formulated in each layer of NeurEPDiff to effectively approximate such mappings. The fact that NeurEPDiff is able to rapidly provide the numerical solution of EPDiff (given any initial condition) results in a significantly reduced computational cost of geodesic shooting of diffeomorphisms in a high-dimensional image space. Additionally, the properties of discretiztion/resolution-invariant of NeurEPDiff make its performance generalizable to multiple image resolutions after being trained offline. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NeurEPDiff in registering two image datasets: 2D synthetic data and 3D brain resonance imaging (MRI). The registration accuracy and computational efficiency are compared with the state-of-the-art diffeomophic registration algorithms with geodesic shooting.

AB We experimentally demonstrate an array of bus-coupled compact one-dimensional photonic crystal nanocavities with large extinction, high-quality factor, and large free spectral range (FSR) exceeding 300 nm centered on the telecom wavelength at 1550 nm. We present designs for an oxide-clad bus-coupled PC switch with 0.96 dB insertion loss, 4.33 dB extinction, and-260 aJ/bit switching energy by careful control of the cavity geometry as well as p-n junction doping. We also demonstrate that air-clad bus-coupled PC switches can operate with 1 dB insertion loss, 3 dB extinction, and-80 aJ/bit switching energy. We present a design route integrating phase change materials that can undergo a controlled transition between amorphous to crystalline material phases of the PCMs for a large change in refractive index. The large index change can overcome fabrication imperfections to effectively align the PC nanocavity resonance to the source laser wavelength thereby enabling true atto-joule per bit operation without the need for active power-consuming thermal heaters.

AB Understanding the relationship between science and society is an objective of science education and is included as a core competency in the AAAS Vision and Change guidelines for biology education. However, traditional undergraduate biology instruction emphasizes scientific practice and generally avoids potentially controversial issues at the intersection of biology and society. By including these topics in biology coursework, instructors can challenge damaging ideologies and systemic inequalities that have influenced science, such as biological essentialism and health disparities. Specifically, an ideologically aware curriculum highlights how ideologies and paradigms shape our biological knowledge base and the application of that knowledge. Ideologically aware lessons emphasize the relationship between science and society with an aim to create more transparent, scientifically accurate, and inclusive postsecondary biology classrooms. Here we expand upon our ideologically aware curriculum with a new activity that challenges undergraduate biology students to consider the impacts of healthcare disparities. This lesson allows instructors to directly address systemic inequalities and allows students to connect biomedical sciences to real-world issues. Implementing an ideologically aware curriculum enables students to challenge prevailing worldviews and better address societal problems that lead to exclusion and oppression.

TI The Effect of Spatially Varying Collision Frequency on the Development
   of the Rayleigh-Taylor Instability
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID SINGLE-MODE; INTERFACE; NUMBER
AB The Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability is ubiquitously observed, yet has traditionally been studied using ideal fluid models. Collisionality can vary strongly across the fluid interface, and previous work demonstrates the necessity of kinetic models to completely capture dynamics in certain collisional regimes. Where previous kinetic simulations used spatially and temporally constant collision frequency, this work presents five-dimensional (two spatial, three velocity dimensions) continuum-kinetic simulations of the RT instability using a more realistic spatially varying collision frequency. Three cases of collisional variation are explored for two Atwood numbers: low to intermediate, intermediate to high, and low to high. The low-to-intermediate case exhibits no RT instability growth, while the intermediate-to-high case is similar to a fluid-limit kinetic case with interface widening biased toward the lower-collisionality region. A novel contribution of this work is the low-to-high collisionality case that shows significantly altered instability growth through an upward movement of the interface and damped spike growth due to increased free-streaming particle diffusion in the lower region. Contributions to the energy flux from the non-Maxwellian portions of the distribution function are not accessible to fluid models and are greatest in magnitude in the spike and regions of low collisionality. Increasing the Atwood number results in greater RT instability growth and reduced upward interface movement. Deviation of the distribution function from Maxwellian is inversely proportional to collision frequency and concentrated around the fluid interface. The linear phase of RT instability growth is well described by theoretical linear growth rates accounting for viscosity and diffusion.

AB High-resolution full waveform seismic tomography of the Earth's mantle beneath the south and central Atlantic Ocean brings into focus a series of asthenospheric low shear velocity channels, or "fingers" on both sides of the southern and central mid-Atlantic ridge (MAR), elongated in the direction of absolute plate motion with a spacing of similar to 1,800 to 2,000 km, and associated with bands of shallower residual seafloor depth anomalies that suggest channeled flow over thousands of kilometers. Each of the three most clearly resolved fingers on the African side of the MAR corresponds to a separate group of whole mantle plumes rooted in distinct patches at the core-mantle boundary, feeding hotspots, and volcanic lines with distinct isotopic signatures. Plumes of a given group appear to merge at the top of the lower mantle before separating again, suggesting interaction of deep mantle flow with a more vigorous mesoscale circulation in the upper mantle. The corresponding hotspots are generally offset from the location of the deep mantle plume roots. The distinct isotopic signatures of these hotspot groups are also detected in the mid-ocean ridge basalts at the location where the fingers meet the ridge. Meanwhile, at least some of the variability within each plume group could originate in the upper mantle and extended transition zone where plumes in a given group appear to merge and pond. This study also adds to mounting evidence that the African large low shear velocity province is not a uniform, unbroken pile of dense material rising high above the core-mantle boundary, but rather a collection of mantle plumes rooted in patches of distinct composition.

AB Atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) is one of the most often used controlled radical polymerization techniques. It employs very small amounts (ppm) of Cu complexes in the presence of various chemical reducing agents but also external stimuli such as light, electrical current or mechanical forces. It can be carried out in bulk, in solution, and in dispersed media. ATRP has been successfully used to prepare various polymers with controlled architecture and well-defined topology, composition, and functionality, as well as bioconjugates and organic-inorganic hybrids. This article summarizes the current status and also an outlook for ATRP.

AB Automated driving desires better performance on tasks like motion planning and interacting with pedestrians in mixed-traffic environments. Deep learning algorithms can achieve high performance in these tasks with remarkable visual scene understanding and generalization abilities. However, when common scene-parsing methods are used to train end-to-end models, limitations of explainability in such algorithms inhibit their implementations in fully automated driving. The main challenges include algorithm performance deficiencies and inconsistencies, insufficient AI transparency, degraded user trust, and undermining human-AI interactions. This research aids the decision-making performance and transparency of automated driving systems by providing multi-modal explanations, especially when interacting with pedestrians. The proposed algorithm combines global visual features and interrelation features by parsing scene images as self-constructed graphs and using an attention-based module to capture the interrelationship among the ego-vehicle and other traffic-related objects. The output modules make decisions while simultaneously generating semantic text explanations. The results show that the fusion of the features from global frames and interrelational graphs improves decision-making and explanation predictions compared to two state-of-the-art benchmark algorithms. The interrelation module also enhances algorithm transparency by disclosing the visual attention used for decision-making. The importance of interrelation features on the two prediction tasks is further revealed along with the underlying mechanism of multitask learning on the datasets with hierarchical labels. The proposed model improves driving decision-making during pedestrian interactions with intelligible reasoning cues for building an appropriate mental model of automated driving performance for human users.

AB Halide perovskites are hailed as semiconductors of the 21st century. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD), a solvent-free method, allows versatility in the growth of thin films of 3- and 2D organic-inorganic halide perovskites. Using CVD grown methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) films as a prototype, the impact of electron beam dosage under cryogenic conditions is evaluated. With 5 kV accelerating voltage, the dosage is varied between 50 and 50000 mu C cm-2. An optimum dosage of 35 000 mu C cm-2 results in a significant blue shift and enhancement of the photoluminescence peak. Concomitantly, a strong increase in the photocurrent is observed. A similar electron beam treatment on chlorine incorporated MAPbI3, where chlorine is known to passivate defects, shows a blue shift in the photoluminescence without improving the photocurrent properties. Low electron beam dosage under cryogenic conditions is found to damage CVD grown 2D phenylethlyammoinum lead iodide films. Monte Carlo simulations reveal differences in electron beam interaction with 3- and 2D halide perovskite films.

AB The application of induction heating (IH) to provide heat for chemical reactions has received great attention due to its potential to electrify chemical reactions. Biomass-based production of acetaldehyde from ethanol has gained rising interest since it provides an alternative sustainable method instead of the fossil-fuel-based output using acetylene and formaldehyde in the presence of a catalyst. The dehydrogenation of ethanol can be catalyzed by supported copper catalysts. The reaction is typically carried out at high temperatures, around 250-300 degrees C, without oxygen. The resulting product mixture usually contains acetaldehyde, as well as other byproducts such as ethylene and hydrogen gas. The acetaldehyde can be separated from the other components using distillation or other separation techniques. In this work, we studied the catalyst activity with IH for the first time and achieved high ethanol conversion and acetaldehyde selectivity at a temperature of 30 & ring;C lower than that with conventional furnace heating (CFH). A transport model was applied to design the catalyst bed configuration and improve the catalyst activity, stability, and energy efficiency by minimizing the temperature gradient. Our work suggests that the temperature distribution and the fast compensation of heat loss through IH are critical for the catalyst behavior. Both high production efficiency and energy efficiency can be achieved with IH, such that it can be an efficient and environment-friendly heating method for the chemical industry.

AB An Educational Remote Laboratory is a software and hardware solution that enables students to access real equipment from any location. In the literature there is a wide range of remote laboratories in many fields (e.g., robotics, electronics, physics, chemistry). However, few experiences have been developed for educational Radar purposes. Radar, which stands for "Radio Detection and Ranging," is a technology that utilizes radio waves to detect distant objects to measure physical parameters like the range, angle, or velocity. Most Radar systems are composed of a transmitter, receiver, antennas and a computer to apply signal processing methods of estimation. This paper introduces the Radar remote laboratory developed by the Remote Hub Lab (RHL). The laboratory involves the creation of a remotely controllable Radar system prototype designed to estimate the rotational velocity of a fixed structure, with initial results presented. This educational tool is oriented toward undergraduate and graduate engineering students, offering them a remote platform to supplement their Radar courses by actively engaging in real-world Radar problem-solving exercises.

AB In this three-component laboratory module, upper-division chemistry students were introduced to the kinetics of the aspirin hydrolysis reaction and determined the concentration of its active pharmaceutical ingredient (acetylsalicylic acid-ASA) using a modern, benchtop ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectrophotometer. In the first component, students prepared analyte solutions from over-the-counter aspirin tablets and a relevant number of standards (n = 9-10) through both serial and parallel dilutions. In the second component, the ASA concentrations of three over-the-counter formulations (325 mg per tablet) were determined with percent differences as small as 1.1% using the Beer-Lambert law and external calibration curves. In the third component, students evaluated the reaction order (pseudo-first order), the rate constant (e.g., k = 3.0 x 10-4 s-1 at 75 degrees C), and the activation energy (E a similar to 67.3 kJ mol-1) of the hydrolysis reaction of ASA at various temperatures (e.g., 25, 37, 50, 75, and 85 degrees C). The last component was completed using a student-centered instructional approach, namely, process-oriented guided-inquiry learning (POGIL), which helped refine students' research process skills and both basic and in-depth laboratory skills (weighing, solution handling, micropipetting, operation of a pH meter and a modern, benchtop absorption spectrophotometer). The student and instructor evaluations indicated a positive learning experience and high interest in this laboratory that was inspired by the quality control and quality assurance of pharmaceutical drugs.

AB Significant photoinduced voltages observed in permalloy structures consist of two contributions with different origins, which depend on illumination conditions, structure geometry and magnetic field in distinct ways. The first component is the plasmon drag effect voltage closely associated with plasmon propagation. The second contribution is magnetically dependent and can be related to photoinduced gradients in the sample temperature and spin polarization. Possible mechanisms of the effect are discussed.

TI Dark matter coupled to radiation: Limits from the Milky Way satellites
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D

ID GALAXY FORMATION; CONSTRAINTS; COLD; IMPACT; WARM
AB Interactions between dark matter (DM) and relativistic particles at early times suppress structure formation on small scales. In particular, the scattering process transfers heat and momentum from radiation to DM, ultimately reducing the abundance of low-mass DM halos and the dwarf galaxies they host. Herein, we derive limits on the DM-photon and DM-neutrino scattering cross section using the Milky Way satellite Galaxy population. We consider temperature-independent interactions parametrized by DM mass () and DM-radiation interaction cross section ((-), where represents the target species). By requiring that the linear matter power spectra are strictly less suppressed than in the case of a thermal-relic warm DM cutoff, we derive the following 95% upper limits at =1 MeV: (-)<1.98x10(-38) cm(2) and (-)<3.16x10(-38) cm(2). Our bounds on (-) depend linearly on for greater than or similar to 1 MeV and improve upon previous limits by 1 order of magnitude. The mass dependence of our limit approaches (3) at lower masses due to the effects of DM sound speed; at =100 keV, we arrive at an upper limit 3 orders of magnitude more stringent than achieved in previous explorations. Upcoming dwarf galaxy surveys will further improve the sensitivity of similar analyses, complementing laboratory and indirect detection searches for DM-radiation interactions.

AB With the rapid advance of high-performance computing and electronic technologies, understanding thermal conductivity in materials has become increasingly important. This study presents a novel method: the site-projected thermal conductivity that quantitatively estimates the local (atomic) contribution to heat transport, leveraging the Green-Kubo thermal transport equations. The effectiveness of this approach on disordered and amorphous graphene, amorphous silicon, and grain boundaries in silicon-germanium alloys is demonstrated. Amorphous graphene reveals a percolation behavior for thermal transport. The results highlight the potential of the method to provide new insights into the thermal behavior of materials, offering a promising avenue for materials design and performance optimization.

AB Graphene oxide/polymer composite water filtration membranes were developed via coalescence of graphene oxide (GO) stabilized Pickering emulsions around a porosity-generating polymer. Triptycene poly(ether ether sulfone)-CH2NH2:HCl polymer interacts with the GO at the water-oil interface, resulting in stable Pickering emulsions. When they are deposited and dried on polytetrafluoro-ethylene substrate, the emulsions fuse to form a continuous GO/ polymer composite membrane. X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy demonstrate that the intersheet spacing and thickness of the membranes increased with increasing polymer concentration, confirming the polymer as the spacer between the GO sheets. The water filtration capability of the composite membranes was tested by removing Rose Bengal from water, mimicking separations of weak black liquor waste. The composite membrane achieved 65% rejection and 2500 g m-2 h-1 bar-1. With high polymer and GO loading, composite membranes give superior rejection and permeance performance when compared with a GO membrane. This methodology for fabrication membranes via GO/polymer Pickering emulsions produces membranes with a homogeneous morphology and robust chemical separation strength.

AB Powdery mildew is an economically important disease caused by c. 1000 different fungal species. Erysiphe vaccinii is an emerging powdery mildew species that is impacting the blueberry industry. Once confined to North America, E. vaccinii is now spreading rapidly across major blueberry-growing regions, including China, Morocco, Mexico, and the USA, threatening millions in losses. This study documents its recent global spread by analyzing both herbarium specimens, some over 150-yr-old, and fresh samples collected world-wide. Our findings were integrated into a 'living phylogeny' via T-BAS to simplify pathogen identification and enable rapid responses to new outbreaks. We identified 50 haplotypes, two primary introductions world-wide, and revealed a shift from a generalist to a specialist pathogen. This research provides insights into the complexities of host specialization and highlights the need to address this emerging global threat to blueberry production.

AB The ultraviolet (UV) photodissociation dynamics of the 1-methylallyl (1-MA) radical were studied using the high-n Rydberg atom time-of-flight (HRTOF) technique in the wavelength region of 226-244 nm. The 1-MA radicals were produced by 193 nm photodissociation of the 3-chloro-1-butene and 1-chloro-2-butene precursor. The 1 + 1 REMPI spectrum of 1-MA agrees with the previous UV absorption spectrum in this wavelength region. Quantum chemistry calculations show that the UV absorption is mainly attributed to the 3p(z) Rydberg state (perpendicular to the allyl plane). The H atom photofragment yield (PFY) spectrum of 1-MA from 3-chloro-1-butene displays a broad peak around 230 nm, while that from 1-chloro-2-butene peaks at similar to 236 nm. The translational energy distributions of the H atom loss product channel, P (E-T)'s, show a bimodal distribution indicating two dissociation pathways in 1-MA. The major pathway is isotropic in product angular distribution with beta similar to 0 and has a low fraction of average translational energy in the total excess energy, < f(T)>, in the range of 0.13-0.17; this pathway corresponds to unimolecular dissociation of 1-MA after internal conversion to form 1,3-butadiene + H. The minor pathway is anisotropic with beta similar to -0.23 and has a large < f(T)> of similar to 0.62-0.72. This fast pathway suggests a direct dissociation of the methyl H atom on a repulsive excited state surface or the repulsive part of the ground state surface to form 1,3-butadiene + H. The fast/slow pathway branching ratio is in the range of 0.03-0.08.

AB Concerns about the risks posed by artificial intelligence (AI) have resulted in growing interest in algorithmic transparency. While algorithmic transparency is well-studied, there is evidence that many organizations do not value implementing transparency. In this case study, we test a ground-up approach to ensuring better real-world algorithmic transparency by creating transparency influencers - motivated individuals within organizations who advocate for transparency. We held an interactive online workshop on algorithmic transparency and advocacy for 15 professionals from news, media, and journalism. We reflect on workshop design choices and presents insights from participant interviews. We found positive evidence for our approach: In the days following the workshop, three participants had done pro-transparency advocacy. Notably, one of them advocated for algorithmic transparency at an organization-wide AI strategy meeting. In the words of a participant: "if you are questioning whether or not you need to tell people [about AI], you need to tell people."

ID RESOURCE-MANAGEMENT
AB Cloud-Based Cyber-Physical Systems (CBCPS) offer considerable benefits by harnessing computational and storage capacities in the cloud. However, disruptions in obtaining real-time access to cloud computational and network resources can impede the control of CBCPS. Hence, minimizing resource demands by adapting the controller's sampling rate can enhance performance. Due to the dynamic nature of the system model, we employ reinforcement learning techniques. We demonstrate our approach through simulation to remotely control a car's speed using cloud-based controllers, dynamically adjusting the sampling frequency to reduce network load and optimize cloud resource utilization. Our proposed method utilizes an actor-critic reinforcement learning framework, specifically the Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm, to learn optimal policies that strike a balance between resource usage, response time, real-time performance, and system stability.

AB We conceptualize and measure upward mobility over income or wealth. At the core of our exercise is the Growth Progressivity Axiom: transfers of instantaneous growth rates from relatively rich to poor individuals increases upward mobility. This axiom, along with mild auxiliary restrictions, identifies an "upward mobility kernel" with a single free parameter, in which mobility is linear in individual growth rates, with geometrically declining weights on baseline incomes. We extend this kernel to trajectories over intervals. The analysis delivers an upward mobility index that does not rely on panel data. That significantly expands our analytical scope to data- poor settings.

AB Global external fields are commonly used to manipulate micro-and nanoparticles in fluid suspension. However, the wireless external actuation has global and coupled influences in the workspace, which limit the robust, independent, and simultaneous control of multiple micro-and nanoparticles. Parametric uncertainty in the particles' motion model and disturbance make it difficult to steer multiple particles precisely. In this paper, an adaptive tube model predictive control (MPC) scheme is proposed to simultaneously control multiple micro-and nanoparticles in fluid suspensions. The control strategy addresses coupled input actuation from the global electric fields. The unknown mobilities of the particles are continually estimated online, which enables the construction of dynamic tubes of individual particles. The recursive feasibility and the input-to-state stability (ISS) of the scheme are proven. The manipulability of the electrophoresis-based microfluidic manipulation system is quantified and analyzed. The manipulability is affected by the dimensions of the actuating electrodes, the number of particles to be simultaneously and independently controlled, and the configurations of those particles in the microfluidic device. The scalability of the lattice-shaped distributed array of electrodes is discussed. Simulation and experimental results validate the effectiveness of the controller to manipulate multiple particles precisely, independently, and simultaneously. Note to Practitioners-To enable the enormous potential of manufacturing functional micro-and nanodevices, it is crucial to automate the steering and manipulation of multiple micro-and nanoparticles. Wireless actuation is a promising way to position those objects in fluid suspensions. However, the global and coupled influences from the wireless external actuation, the parametric uncertainty in the particles' motion model, and the external disturbances from the fluid flow limit the robust, independent, and simultaneous control of multiple micro-and nanoparticles. In this paper, we present an adaptive tube model predictive control (MPC) scheme to simultaneously control multiple micro-and nanoparticles in fluid suspensions using electric fields. The scheme estimates the unknown mobilities of the particles, constructs dynamic tubes online, and addresses the coupled actuation from the global electric field. The manipulability of the electrophoresis-based microfluidic manipulation system is introduced, quantified, and analyzed. Those analyses give insights into designing the most effective electrode array and the efficient trajectories to achieve agile particle motions. Experimental results validate the manipulability analyses and the performance of the proposed control strategy.

DE Solid-state synthesis; Suppression of ferromagnetism;
   Metal-semiconductor transition; Sb-doped Cr4PtGa17
AB We describe the doping effects on a metallic breathing pyrochlore compound, Cr4PtGa17. Upon doping with Sb, i.e., Cr4Pt(Ga1-xSbx)(17), it was found that a selective doping on one of the seven Ga sites occurs. With increasing dopant level, the ferromagnetism in the parent compound is gradually suppressed, along with a decrease in fitted Curie-Weiss temperature (from 61 (1) K to -1.8 (1) K) and effective moment (from similar to 2.26 mu(B)/f.u. to similar to 0.68 mu(B)/f.u.). Low-temperature heat capacity measurements confirm the absence of magnetic ordering above 0.4 K for the three most doped samples. Meanwhile, electrical resistivity measurements display a metal-semiconductor transition with increasing Sb contents, which is attributed to an increase of Fermi energy based on the calculations of electronic band structure and density of states. Moreover, we have speculated that the ferromagnetism in Cr4PtGa17 is governed by itinerant electrons according to our observations. This study of Sb-doping effect on Cr4PtGa17 provides deeper understanding of magnetism of this system and possibilities for future modifications.

AB Wireless backscattering has been deemed suitable for various emerging energy-constrained applications given its low-power architectures. Although existing backscatter nodes often operate at sub-6 GHz frequency bands, moving to the sub-THz bands offers significant advantages in scaling low-power connectivity to dense user populations; as concurrent transmissions can be separated in both spectral and spatial domains given the large swath of available bandwidth and laser-shaped beam directionality in this frequency regime. However, the power consumption and complexity of wireless devices increase significantly with frequency. In this paper, we present LeakyScatter, the first backscatter system that enables directional, low-power, and frequency-agile wireless links above 100 GHz. LeakyScatter departs from conventional backscatter designs and introduces a novel architecture that relies on aperture reciprocity in leaky-wave devices. We have fabricated LeakyScatter and evaluated its performance through extensive simulations and over-the-air experiments. Our results demonstrate a scalable wireless link above 100 GHz that is retrodirective and operates at a large bandwidth (tens of GHz) and ultra-low-power (zero power consumed for directional steering and <= 1 mW for data modulation).

TI Combinatorial optimization with quantum imaginary time evolution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
LA English
DT Article
AB We use quantum imaginary-time evolution (QITE) to solve polynomial unconstrained binary optimization (PUBO) problems. We show that a linear ansatz yields good results for a wide range of PUBO problems, often outperforming standard classical methods, such as the Goemans-Williamson (GW) algorithm. We obtain numerical results for the low-autocorrelation binary sequences (LABS) and weighted MaxCut combinatorial optimization problems, thus extending an earlier demonstration of successful application of QITE on MaxCut for unweighted graphs. We find the performance of QITE on the LABS problem with a separable ansatz comparable to QAOA at level 10 for up to 18 vertices and do not see a significant advantage with an entangling ansatz. On weighted MaxCut, QITE with a separable ansatz often outperforms the GW algorithm on graphs with up to 150 vertices.

DE Cybersecurity; federated learning; backdoor attack; clipping; filtering
AB Federated Learning (FL) allows individual clients to train a global model by aggregating local model updates each round. This results in collaborative model training while maintaining the privacy of clients' sensitive data. However, malicious clients can join the training process and train with poisoned data or send artificial model updates in targeted poisoning attacks. Many defenses to targeted poisoning attacks rely on anomaly-detection based metrics which remove participants that deviate from the majority. Similarly, aggregation-based defenses aim to reduce the impact of outliers, while L2-norm clipping tries to scale down the impact of malicious models. However, oftentimes these defenses misidentify benign clients as malicious or only work under specific attack conditions. In our paper, we examine the effectiveness of two anomaly-detection metrics on three different aggregation methods, in addition to the presence of L2-norm clipping and weight selection, across two different types of attacks. We also combine different defenses in order to examine their interaction and examine each defense when no attack is present. We found minimum aggregation to be the most effective defense against label-flipping attacks, whereas both minimum aggregation and geometric median worked well against distributed backdoor attacks. Using random weight selection significantly deteriorated defenses against both attacks, whereas the use of clipping made little difference. Finally, the main task accuracy was directly correlated with the BA in the label-flipping attack and generally was close to the MA in benign scenarios. However, in the DBA the MA and BA are inversely correlated and the MA fluctuates greatly.

AB We used a reverse-correlation image-classification paradigm to visualize facial representations of immigrants and citizens in the United States. Visualizations of immigrants' faces were judged by independent raters as less trustworthy and less competent and were more likely to be categorized as a non-White race/ethnicity than were visualizations of citizens' faces. Additionally, image generators' personal characteristics (e.g., implicit and explicit evaluations of immigrants, nativity status) did not reliably track with independent judges' ratings of image generators' representations of immigrants. These findings suggest that anti-immigrant sentiment and racial/ethnic assumptions characterize facial representations of immigrants in the United States, even among people who harbor positivity toward immigrants.

AB This work investigates how tutoring discourse interacts with students' proximal knowledge to explain and predict students' learning outcomes. Our work is conducted in the context of high-dosage human tutoring where 9th-grade students (N = 1080) attended small group tutorials and individually practiced problems on an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS). We analyzed whether tutors' talk moves and students' performance on the ITS predicted scores on math learning assessments. We trained Random Forest Classifiers (RFCs) to distinguish high and low assessment scores based on tutor talk moves, student's ITS performance metrics, and their combination. A decision tree was extracted from each RFC to yield an interpretable model. We found AUCs of 0.63 for talk moves, 0.66 for ITS, and 0.77 for their combination, suggesting interactivity among the two feature sources. Specifically, the best decision tree emerged from combining the tutor talk moves that encouraged rigorous thinking and students' ITS mastery. In essence, tutor talk that encouraged mathematical reasoning predicted achievement for students who demonstrated high mastery on the ITS, whereas tutors' revoicing of students' mathematical ideas and contributions was predictive for students with low ITS mastery. Implications for practice are discussed.

AB Rancid animal fats unsuitable for human or animal food production represent low-value and abundant, yet underexploited organic chemical precursors. The current work describes a strategy to synthesize high sulfur-content materials (HSMs) that directly utilizes a blend of partially hydrolyzed chicken fat and plant oils as the organic comonomers, following up on analogous reactions using brown grease in place of chicken fat. The reaction of sulfur and chicken fat with either canola or sunflower oil yielded crosslinked polymer composites CFSx or GFSx, respectively (x = wt% sulfur, varied from 85%-90%). The composites exhibited compressive strengths of 24.7-31.7 MPa, and flexural strengths of 4.1-5.7 MPa, exceeding the value of established construction materials like ordinary Portland cement (compressive strength & GE;17 MPa required for residential building, flexural strength 2-5 MPa). The composites also exhibited thermal stability up to 215-224 & DEG;C. The simple single-step protocol described herein represents a way to upcycle an affordable and previously unexploited animal fat resource to form structural composites via the atom economical inverse vulcanization mechanism.
   This study evaluates the use of partially rancidified/hydrolyzed chicken fat as a comonomer with plant oils and sulfur to form durable composites. These studies allowed assessment of the extent to which plant oil and animal fat unsaturation content influences resulting composite mechanical properties. Compressive strengths exceeding those of traditional mineral cement have been achieved with some of the composites.image

AB Designing polymers with desirable thermal or thermoelectric properties has been a great goal in the field of organic functional materials. This is widely considered challenging because polymers manifest complicated transport characteristics due to their intertwined molecular chains, complex intra- and inter-molecular interactions, and strong heterogeneities in both morphology and pathways of primary energy carriers. These molecular- and nano-scale attributes regulate energy transport and conversion, leading to low bulk-level thermal conductivity and moderate thermoelectric energy conversion performance. Polymers with extreme and controllable thermophysical properties hold the potential to advance many thermal management and renewable energy technologies. The past decade has witnessed significant progress on this topic, owing to the advances in micro-, nano-, and molecular-scale engineering that have created polymers with metal-like thermal conductivity for thermal management technologies and polymers with high charge carrier density for thermoelectric applications. This review focuses on molecular perspective and engineering in two key areas: thermoelectric properties in conducting polymers and thermal transport in polymers with phonons as the dominant energy carrier. The review begins with a theoretical explanation of charge and thermal transport in polymers from a molecular and mesoscale perspective. It reviews thermoelectric polymer synthesis and modification methods for increasing thermoelectric efficiency. The later section of the review surveys molecular engineering efforts in optimizing thermal transport in polymers with phonons as the dominant energy carrier and discusses the interrelated charge and thermal transport in conducting polymers. We also summarize recent efforts to study the dynamic control of thermal and thermoelectric properties of polymers using external stimuli. Finally, we discuss some outstanding challenges and potential future directions.
   This review highlights molecular and nanoscale engineering of electrically insulating and semiconducting polymers for improved heat transport and thermoelectricity.

AB The benefits of photonics over electronics in the application of optical transceivers and both classical and quantum computing have been demonstrated over the past decades, especially in the ability to achieve high bandwidth, high interconnectivity, and low latency. Due to the high maturity of silicon photonics foundries, research on photonics devices such as silicon micro ring resonators (MRRs), Mach-Zehnder modulators (MZM), and photonic crystal (PC) resonators has attracted plenty of attention. Among these photonic devices, silicon MRRs using carrier depletion effects in p-n junctions represent optical switches manufacturable in the most compact magnitude at high volume with demonstrated switching energies similar to 5.2fJ/bit. In matrix multiplication demonstrated with integrated photonics, one approach is to couple one bus straight waveguide to several MRRs with different resonant wavelengths to transport signals in different channels, corresponding to a matrix row or column. However, such architectures are potentially limited to similar to 30 MRRs in series, by the limited free-spectral range (FSR) of an individual MRR. We show that PC switches with sub-micron optical mode confinements can have a FSR >300nm, which can potentially enable energy efficient computing with larger matrices of similar to 200 resonators by multiplexing. In this paper, we present designs for an oxide-clad bus-coupled PC switch with 1dB insertion loss, 5dB extinction, and similar to 260aJ/bit switching energy by careful control of the cavity geometry as well as p-n junction doping. We also demonstrate that air-clad bus-coupled PC switches can operate with 1dB insertion loss, 3dB extinction, and similar to 80aJ/bit switching energy.

AB Towards the large amount of data generated every-day, data selective sharing and acquisition is one of the most significant data services in cloud-based systems, which enables data owners to selectively share their data to some particular users, and users to selectively acquire some interested data. How -ever, it is challenging to protect data security and user privacy during data selective sharing and selective acquisition, because cloud servers are curious about the data or user's interests, and even send data to some unauthorized users or some uninterested users. In this paper, we propose an efficient and provably secure Data selective Sharing and Acquisition (DSA) scheme for cloud-based systems. Specifically, we first formulate a generic data selective sharing and acquisition problem in cloud-based systems by identifying several design goals in terms of correctness, soundness, security and efficiency. Then, we propose the DSA scheme to enable data owners to control the access of their data in a fine-grained manner, and enable users to refine the data acquisition without revealing their interests. Technically, a brand new cryptographic framework is developed to integrate attribute-based encryption with searchable encryption. Finally, we prove that the proposed DSA scheme is correct, sound, secure in the random oracle model, and efficient in practice.

DT Article
ID THERMALIZATION; LOCALIZATION; DYNAMICS
AB We simulate the dynamics of Rydberg atoms resonantly exchanging energy via two-, three-, and four-body dipole-dipole interactions in a one-dimensional array. Using simplified models of a realistic experimental system, we study the initial-state survival probability, mean level spacing, spread of entanglement, and properties of the energy eigenstates. By exploring a range of disorders and interaction strengths, we find regions in parameter space where the three- and four-body dynamics either fail to thermalize or do so slowly. The interplay between the stronger hopping and weaker field-tuned interactions gives rise to quantum many-body scar states, which play a critical role in slowing the dynamics of the three- and four-body interactions.

AB Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising materials with various applications, and machine learning (ML) techniques can enable their design and understanding of structure-property relationships. In this paper, we use machine learning (ML) to cluster the MOFs using two different approaches. For the first set of clusters, we decompose the data using the textural properties and cluster the resulting components. We separately cluster the MOF space with respect to their topology. The feature data from each of the clusters were then fed into separate neural networks (NNs) for direct learning on an adsorption task (methane or hydrogen). The resulting NNs were then used in transfer learning (TL) where only the last NN layer was retrained. The results show significant differences in TL performance based on which cluster is chosen for direct learning. We find TL performance depends on the Euclidean distance in the decomposed feature space between the clusters involved in the direct and TL. Similar results were found when TL was performed simultaneously across both types of clusters and adsorption tasks. We note that methane adsorption was a better source task than hydrogen adsorption. Overall, the approach was able to identify MOFs with the most transferable information, leading to valuable insights and a more comprehensive understanding of the MOF landscape. This highlights the method's potential to generate a deeper understanding of complex systems and provides an opportunity for its application in alternative datasets.

AB We present a new suite of over 1500 cosmological N-body simulations with varied warm dark matter (WDM) models ranging from 2.5 to 30 keV. We use these simulations to train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to infer WDM particle masses from images of DM field data. Our fiducial setup can make accurate predictions of the WDM particle mass up to 7.5 keV with an uncertainty of +/- 0.5 keV at a 95 per cent confidence level from (25 h(-1)Mpc)(2) maps. We vary the image resolution, simulation resolution, redshift, and cosmology of our fiducial setup to better understand how our model is making predictions. Using these variations, we find that our models are most dependent on simulation resolution, minimally dependent on image resolution, not systematically dependent on redshift, and robust to varied cosmologies. We also find that an important feature to distinguish between WDM models is present with a linear size between 100 and 200 h(-1) kpc. We compare our fiducial model to one trained on the power spectrum alone and find that our field-level model can make two times more precise predictions and can make accurate predictions to two times as massive WDM particle masses when used on the same data. Overall, we find that the field-level data can be used to accurately differentiate between WDM models and contain more information than is captured by the power spectrum. This technique can be extended to more complex DM models and opens up new opportunities to explore alternative DM models in a cosmological environment.

ID LABEL-FREE DETECTION
AB Diverse chip-based sensors utilizing integrated silicon photonics have been demonstrated in resonator and phase shifter/interferometer configurations. Till date, interferometric techniques with the Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (MZI) and Young's interferometer have shown the lowest mass detection limits (in pg/mm(2)). Slow light in photonic crystal waveguides integrated with MZIs enables compact geometries due to enhanced optical path lengths as light propagates with high group index. In a typical MZI, light propagating in the signal arm overlaps with analytes and undergo a relative phase change with respect to the light in the reference arm which leads to measured output intensity changes. In this paper, using integrated photonic methods, we demonstrate a slow light enhanced Michelson interferometer (MI) biosensor, wherein the reference and signal arms are traversed twice by the propagating optical mode. As a result, the analyte interaction length is effectively doubled since the propagating optical mode undergoes twice the phase shift as would be observed in a MZI. In an asymmetric MI configuration, the resultant doubling of the phase shift is observed as a doubling of the resonance wavelength shift for a fixed change in the analyte concentration. The device sensitivity is thus doubled with respect to a conventional MZI while also effectively halving the geometric length compared to the MZI sensor.

AB Garnet U-Pb dating by laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry requires the development of matrix-matched reference materials of variable chemistry and U mass fraction for accurate analysis. Additional calibration of existing primary reference materials is also justified based on the relatively poor calibration of some of the widely available primary reference materials that are currently utilised by the geoscience community. We present a micro sampling workflow combined with a refined ID-TIMS methodology for the generation of high precision (similar to 0.1%) U-Pb dates from domains within garnet single crystals. Using this workflow, we calibrated two new natural andradite reference materials, the Jumbo andradite (And(99); 110.34 +/- 0.03 (0.04) [0.13] Ma, n = 7, MSWD = 1.21) and the Tiptop andradite (And(87); 209.57 +/- 0.11 (0.13) [0.26] Ma, n = 6, MSWD = 1.39). We also present additional calibration of the widely utilised Willsboro-Lewis andradite primary reference material (And(90); 1024.7 +/- 9.5 (9.6) [9.6] Ma (2s; overdispersed), n = 6). Wafers of the Jumbo and Tiptop andradite reference materials are available from the authors upon request.

AB Knowledge of the rates of dissolution of rock-forming minerals close to equilibrium and their dependence on Delta Gr, the Gibbs free energy of reaction, is essential for describing the temporal and spatial evolution of many environmental and engineering processes involving solid/fluid interactions. In the present study we used the isotopedoping method to quantify albite forward and net dissolution rates. Batch experiments were performed at 150, 180 degrees C and pH = 9 at near equilibrium and equilibrium conditions (-25 <= Delta Gr <= + 8.2 kJ/mol) in 29Si spiked solutions which were undersaturated with the secondary Al-Si solid phases likely to precipitate. The forward dissolution rates normalized to the initial BET surface area were found to decrease continuously and monotonically with increasing time and Delta Gr, achieving values 1.3 to 2.4 orders of magnitude lower at chemical equilibrium than initial far from equilibrium values, with the highest rate decrease for the highest solid to fluid ratio. These rate drops were accompanied by an increase in BET specific surface areas associated with the formation of widespread dissolution features. A decrease of albite forward dissolution rate together with an increase of its BET surface area was also observed as a function of reaction time at far from equilibrium conditions (Delta Gr <= - 65 kJ/mol). These observations are consistent with a continuous decrease with time and increasing Delta Gr of albite effective surface area linked to the formation of unreactive negative crystal facets, in addition to etch pits stopping nucleating above a critical value of Delta Gr. Thus, the observed decrease in albite dissolution rate as equilibrium is approached is not linked primarily to the increase in the contribution of the backward reaction but rather to the decrease of the forward reaction rate in conjunction with the decrease in the density of reactive sites at the mineral surface. The results of this study show that the characterization of the effective surface area and its evolution with reaction time and chemical affinity is crucial to deriving robust dissolution rates of well-crystallized minerals like feldspars. Dissolution experiments in 29Si spiked solutions of samples with different history and wellcharacterized effective surface area and surface morphology should help to better quantify the rate laws controlling silicate minerals weathering.

TI Gradual degradation in InAs quantum dot lasers on Si and GaAs
SO NANOSCALE

ID DEFECT STRUCTURE; DISLOCATIONS; RELIABILITY; STEM
AB Reliable quantum dot lasers on silicon are a key remaining challenge to successful integrated silicon photonics. In this work, quantum dot (QD) lasers on silicon with and without misfit dislocation trapping layers are aged for 12 000 hours and are compared to QD lasers on native GaAs aged for 8400 hours. The non-trapping-layer (TL) laser on silicon degrades heavily during this time, but much more modest gradual degradation is observed for the other two devices. Electroluminescence imaging reveals relatively uniform gradual dimming for the aged TL laser on silicon. At the same time, we find nanoscale dislocation loop defects throughout the quantum dot-based active region of all three aged lasers via electron microscopy. The Burgers vector of these loops is consistent with . We suggest that the primary source of degradation, however, is the generation and migration of point defects that substantially enhance non-radiative recombination in the active region, the visible symptom of which is the formation of dislocation loops. To prevent this, we propose that laser fabrication should be switched from deeply etched to shallow etch ridges where the active region remains intact near the mesa. Additionally, post-growth annealing and altered growth conditions in the active region should be explored to minimize the grown-in point defect density.
   After extended aging, InAs quantum dot lasers form dislocation loops in the active region due to the coalescence of point defects. The point-defect formation process drives gradual laser degradation and is a key impediment to long-life lasers.

AB While centralized security methods such as Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) have fortified connected vehicles (CVs) security, decentralized approaches show promise in distributing security responsibilities and reducing vulnerability to cyber threats. Implementing a decentralized architecture can decrease susceptibility to large-scale cyber-attacks and enhance overall system robustness. Consensus-based trust models present avenue for scalable, decentralized security protocols in CV networks. While numerous consensus-based trust algorithms have been proposed, their validation often relied on non-representative datasets, prompting the development of more accurate simulation methodologies. This research enhances the simulation workflow by diversifying noise models, using a benchmark consensus-based trust algorithm, and addressing persistent attack model limitations.

TI Wall Modeling of Turbulent Flows with Varying Pressure Gradients Using
   Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
SO AIAA JOURNAL

DT Article
DE Wall Modeled Large Eddy Simulation; Reinforcement Learning; Pressure
   Gradient; Flow Separation; Turbulent Flow
ID LARGE-EDDY SIMULATION; BOUNDARY-CONDITIONS
AB We propose a framework for developing wall models for large-eddy simulation that is able to capture pressure-gradient effects using multi-agent reinforcement learning. Within this framework, the distributed reinforcement learning agents receive off-wall environmental states, including pressure gradient and turbulence strain rate, ensuring adaptability to a wide range of flows characterized by pressure-gradient effects and separations. Based on these states, the agents determine an action to adjust the wall eddy viscosity and, consequently, the wall-shear stress. The model training is in situ with wall-modeled large-eddy simulation grid resolutions and does not rely on the instantaneous velocity fields from high-fidelity simulations. Throughout the training, the agents compute rewards from the relative error in the estimated wall-shear stress, which allows them to refine an optimal control policy that minimizes prediction errors. Employing this framework, wall models are trained for two distinct subgrid-scale models using low-Reynolds-number flow over periodic hills. These models are validated through simulations of flows over periodic hills at higher Reynolds numbers and flows over the Boeing Gaussian bump. The developed wall models successfully capture the acceleration and deceleration of wall-bounded turbulent flows under pressure gradients and outperform the equilibrium wall model in predicting skin friction.

ID ACCESSIBILITY; CARE
AB Travel-time computation with large transportation networks is often computationally intensive for two main reasons: 1) large computer memory is required to handle large networks; and 2) calculating shortest-distance paths over large networks is computing intensive. Therefore, previous research tends to limit their spatial extent to reduce computational intensity or resolve computational intensity with advanced cyberinfrastructure. In this context, this article describes a new Spatial Partitioning Algorithm for Scalable Travel-time Computation (SPASTC) that is designed based on spatial domain decomposition with computer memory limit explicitly considered. SPASTC preserves spatial relationships required for travel-time computation and respects a user-specified memory limit, which allows efficient and large-scale travel-time computation within the given memory limit. We demonstrate SPASTC by computing spatial accessibility to hospital beds across the conterminous United States. Our case study shows that SPASTC achieves significant efficiency and scalability making the travel-time computation tens of times faster.

AB Domain adversarial adaptation in a continual setting poses significant challenges due to the limitations of accessing previous source domain data. Despite extensive research in continual learning, adversarial adaptation cannot be effectively accomplished using only a small number of stored source domain data, a standard setting in memory replay approaches. This limitation arises from the erroneous empirical estimation of H-divergence with few source domain samples. To tackle this problem, we propose a double-head discriminator algorithm by introducing an additional source-only domain discriminator trained solely on the source learning phase. We prove that by introducing a pre-trained source-only domain discriminator, the empirical estimation error of H-divergence related adversarial loss is reduced from the source domain side. Further experiments on existing domain adaptation benchmarks show that our proposed algorithm achieves more than 2% improvement on all categories of target domain adaptation tasks while significantly mitigating the forgetting of the source domain.

AB Human brains use a tree-like neuron network for information processing at high efficiency and low energy consumption. Tree-like structures have also been engineered to enhance mass and heat transfer in various applications. In this work, we reveal the heat transfer mechanism in tree-structured polymer linked gold nanoparticle (AuNP) networks using atomistic simulations. We report both upward and downward heat fluxes between root and leaf nodes in tree-structured polyethylene (PE) and poly(p-phenylene) (PPP) linked AuNP networks at tree levels from 1 to 5. We found that the heat conductance increases with an increasing polymer tree level. The heat transfer enhancement is due to the resulting increase in the low-frequency vibrational modes. This and other thermal properties are affected by the location of the AuNPs in the tree. Moreover, complex tree structures with at least five levels were found to be robust in the sense that disabling half of the leaves did not change the overall heat conductance.

AB A heterogeneous design of mechanical metamaterial enables digital stiffness programmability. The prototype is composed of an elastomer matrix containing diamond-shaped cavities that are selectively confined along their diagonals by semi-rigid plastic beam inserts. Unit-cell perturbations caused by insert placement or removal reshape the global constitutive relation, whose lower and upper bounds correspond to configurations with all holes empty and all inserts in place, respectively, due to a gap between the elastomer and insert moduli. Bidirectional operation is accomplished by varying the orientation of the inserts, with longitudinal inserts increasing the macroscopic stiffness in compression and transverse inserts increasing that in tension. Arranged digital representations of such local insert states form the explicit encoding of global patterns, allowing both statical and in situ systematic stiffness programming with minimal mass changes. These properties establish a new paradigm for actively tuning vibration isolation systems in response to changes in the base structure's resonances. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The move toward electrification is critical for decarbonizing the energy sector but may exacerbate energy unaffordability without proper safeguards. Addressing this challenge requires capturing neighborhood-scale dynamics to uncover the blind spots in residential electricity inequality. Based on publicly available, multisourced remote sensing and census data, we develop a high-resolution, spatiotemporally explicit machine learning (ML) framework to predict tract-level monthly electricity consumption across the conterminous U.S. from 2013-2020. We then construct the electricity affordability gap (EAG) metric, defined as the gap between electricity bills and 3% of household income, to better identify energy-vulnerable communities over space and time. The results show that our framework largely improves the resolution of electricity consumption data while achieving an R 2 of 0.82 compared to the Low-Income Energy Affordability Data (LEAD). We estimate an annual $16.18 billion economic burden on the ability to afford electricity bills, exceeding current federal appropriations in alleviating energy difficulties. We also observe pronounced seasonal and urban-rural disparities, with monthly EAG in summer and winter being 2-3 times greater than other seasons and rural residents facing burdens up to 1.7 times higher than their urban counterparts. These insights inform equitable electrification by addressing spatiotemporal mismatches and multiple jurisdictional challenges in energy justice efforts.

AB A digitally encoded mechanical metamaterial utilizing selective insertion of rigid elements into an elastomeric matrix achieves programmable stiffness based on geometric patterns. Beyond the linear behavior, interests are developed towards the nonlinear stiffness region to extend the application of such metamaterials from vibration isolation to shock mitigation. A 12-unit-cell prototype is constructed and experimentally characterized under compression and drop tests, yielding the stress-strain curves and energy absorption capabilities of all independent geometric patterns identified, respectively, with validation by finite-element analysis. The versatility of the metamaterial is illustrated via a categorization of its pattern-dependent responses.

AB High-throughput molecular simulations and machine learning(ML)have been implemented to adequately screen a large number of metal-organicframeworks (MOFs) for applications involving adsorption. Grand canonicalMonte Carlo (GCMC) simulations have proven effective in calculatingthe adsorption capacity at given pressures and temperatures, but theycan require expensive computational resources. While they can be resource-efficient,ML models can require large datasets, creating a need for algorithmsthat can efficiently characterize adsorption; active learning (AL)can play a very important role in this regard. In this work, we makeuse of Gaussian process regression (GPR) to model pure component adsorptionof nitrogen at 77 K from 10(-5) to 1 bar, methaneat 298 K from 10 (-5) to 100 bar, carbon dioxide at298 K from 10(-5) to 100 bar, and hydrogen at 77 Kfrom 10(-5) to 100 bar on PCN-61, MgMOF-74, DUT-32,DUT-49, MOF-177, NU-800, UiO-66, ZIF-8, IRMOF-1, IRMOF-10, and IRMOF-16.The GPR model requires an initial training of the model with an initialdataset, the prior one, and, in this study of evaluating AL, we makeuse of three different prior selection schemes. Each prior schemeis updated with a sampling point resulting from the GP model uncertainties.This protocol continues until a maximum GPR relative error of 2% isattained. We make a recommendation on the best prior selection schemefor the total 44 adsorbate-adsorbent pairs primarily makinguse of the mean absolute error and the total amount of points requiredfor convergence of the model. To further evaluate the AL framework,we apply the BET consistency criteria on the simulated and GP nitrogenisotherms and compare the resulting surface areas.

AB Lignin is the most abundant natural source of aromatics but remains underutilized. Elemental sulfur is a plentiful by-product of fossil fuel refining. Herein we report a strategy for preparing a durable composite by the one-pot reaction of elemental sulfur and lignin oil comprising lower molecular weight lignin derivatives. A lignin oil-sulfur composite (LOS 90 ) was prepared by reacting 10 wt. % lignin oil with 90 wt. % elemental sulfur. The composite could be remelted and reshaped over several cycles without loss of properties. Results from the study showed that LOS 90 has properties competitive with or exceeding values for commercial ordinary Portland cement and brick formulations. For example, LOS 90 displayed impressive compressive strength (22.1 MPa) and flexural strength (5.7 MPa). LOS 90 is prepared entirely from waste materials with 98.5% atom economy of composite synthesis, a low E factor of 0.057, and lignin char as the only waste product of the process for its preparation. These results suggest the potential applications of lignin and waste sulfur in the continuous efforts to develop more recyclable and sustainable materials.

ID HARMONIC-BALANCE ANALYSIS
AB This paper examines the effect of viscoelasticity on the periodic response of a lumped parameter viscoelastic von Mises truss. The viscoelastic system is described by a second-order equation that governs the mechanical motion coupled to a first-order equation that governs the time evolution of the viscoelastic forces. The viscoelastic force evolves at a much slower rate than the elastic oscillations in the system. This adds additional time scales and degrees of freedom to the system compared to its viscous counterparts. The focus of this study is on the system's behavior under harmonic loading, which is expected to show both regular and chaotic dynamics for certain combinations of forcing frequency and amplitude. While the presence of chaos in this system has already been demonstrated, we shall concentrate only on the periodic solutions. The presence of the intrawell and interwell periodic oscillations is revealed using the Harmonic Balance method. The study also looks at the influence of parameter changes on the system's behavior through bifurcation diagrams, which enable us to identify optimal system parameters for maximum energy dissipation. Lastly, we formulate an equivalent viscous system using an energy-based approach. We observe that a naive viscous model fails to capture the behavior accurately depending on the system and excitation parameters, as well as the type of excitation. This underscores the necessity to study the full-scale viscoelastic system.

AB Entanglement is at the heart of emerging technologies such as quantum computing, quantum sensing, and quantum networking. These technologies are developed by interdisciplinary teams of engineers, physicists, software developers, and other scientists. As a result, quantum concepts, such as entanglement, are essential to introduce to a wide range of disciplines. In response, many universities have implemented quantum information science and engineering (QISE) courses for undergraduate students. These QISE courses present quantum concepts to students from diverse disciplines at an introductory level, whereas previously, they were reserved for advanced physics courses. We interviewed students who had recently completed an introductory QISE course to investigate their conceptual and mathematical understanding of entanglement. We found that entanglement was most strongly associated with the idea of correlation between measurements, while only some students productively used the mathematical criterion of whether or not a quantum state was factorable.

AB The ability to distinguish between different explanations of human memory abilities continues to be the subject of many ongoing theoretical debates. These debates attempt to account for a growing corpus of empirical phenomena in item-memory judgments, which include the list strength effect, the strength-based mirror effect, and output interference. One of the main theoretical contenders is the Retrieving Effectively from Memory (REM) model. We show that REM, in its current form, has difficulties in accounting for source-memory judgments - a situation that calls for its revision. We propose an extended REM model that assumes a local-matching process for source judgments alongside source differentiation. We report a first evaluation of this model's predictions using three experiments in which we manipulated the relative source-memory strength of different lists of items. Analogous to item-memory judgments, we observed a null list strength effect and a strength-based mirror effect in the case of source memory. In a second evaluation, which relied on a novel experiment alongside two previously published datasets, we evaluated the model's predictions regarding the manifestation of output interference in item and lack of it in source memory judgments. Our results showed output interference severely affecting the accuracy of item-memory judgments but having a null or negligible impact when it comes to source-memory judgments. Altogether, these results support REM's core notion of differentiation (for both item and source information) as well as the concept of local matching proposed by the present extension.

AB For decades, the fundamental driving force behind energy-efficient and cost-effective electronic components has been the downward scaling of electronic devices. However, due to approaching the fundamental limits of silicon-based complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) devices, various emerging materials and device structures are considered alternative aspirants, such as negative-capacitance field-effect transistors (NCFETs), for their promising advantages in terms of scaling, speed, and power consumption. In this article, we present a brief overview of the progress made on NCFETs, including theoretical and experimental approaches, a current understanding of NCFET device physics, possible physical mechanisms for NC, and future functionalization prospects. In addition, in the context of recent findings, critical technological difficulties that must be addressed in the NCFET development are also discussed.

AB Recent advances in machine learning have shown that Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) can improve machine learning models and align them with human preferences. Although very successful for Large Language Models (LLMs), these advancements have not had a comparable impact in research for autonomous vehicles-where alignment with human expectations can be imperative. In this paper, we propose to adapt similar RL-based methods to unsupervised object discovery, i.e. learning to detect objects from LiDAR points without any training labels. Instead of labels, we use simple heuristics to mimic human feedback. More explicitly, we combine multiple heuristics into a simple reward function that positively correlates its score with bounding box accuracy, i.e., boxes containing objects are scored higher than those without. We start from the detector's own predictions to explore the space and reinforce boxes with high rewards through gradient updates. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach is not only more accurate, but also orders of magnitudes faster to train compared to prior works on object discovery.

AB Microbiome composition and function often change throughout a host's life cycle, reflecting shifts in the ecological niche of the host. The mechanisms that establish these relationships are therefore important dimensions of host ecology and evolution; yet, their nature remains poorly understood. Here, we sought to investigate the microbial communities associated with the complex life cycle of the dung beetle Onthophagus taurus and the relative contributions of host life stage, sex, and environment in determining microbiome assembly. We find that O. taurus plays host to a diverse microbiota that undergo drastic community shifts throughout host development, influenced by host life stage, environmental microbiota, and, to a lesser degree, sex. Contrary to predictions, we found that egg and pupal stages-despite the absence of a digestive tract or defined microbe-storing organs-do not constrain microbial maintenance, while host-constructed environments, such as a maternally derived fecal pellet or the pupal chamber constructed by late larvae, may still serve as complementary microbial refugia for select taxa. Lastly, we identify a small community of putative core microbiota likely to shape host development and fitness. Our results provide important insights into mechanisms employed by solitary organisms to assemble, maintain, and adjust beneficial microbiota to confront life-stage-specific needs and challenges.<br /> IMPORTANCE As the influence of symbionts on host ecology, evolution, and development has become more apparent so has the importance of understanding how hosts facilitate the reliable maintenance of their interactions with these symbionts. A growing body of work has thus begun to identify diverse behaviors and physiological mechanisms underpinning the selective colonization of beneficial symbionts across a range of host taxa. Yet, how organisms with complex life cycles, such as holometabolous insects, establish and maintain key symbionts remains poorly understood. This is particularly interesting considering the drastic transformations of both internal and external host morphology, and the ecological niche shifts in diet and environment, that are the hallmark of metamorphosis. This work investigates the dynamic changes of the microbiota associated with the complex life cycle and host-constructed environments of the bull-headed dung beetle, Onthophagus taurus, a useful model for understanding how organisms may maintain and modulate their microbiota across development.

DE TikTok; Disinformation; Information Retrieval
AB Lectures and seminars which are commonly used in schools as teaching methods have faced criticism for lacking personal touch. The rapid growth and influence of media platforms have revolutionized how information is shared and consumed, with a particular emphasis on their integration as valuable educational tools. TikTok, a short-form video platform has gained recognition among users of all ages. While TikTok is mostly known for its viral content there is a growing interest in exploring its educational potential. This research paper focuses on examining TikTok as a teaching tool for general education teachers (GE) special education teachers (SPEDs) and speech-language pathologists (SLPs), aiming to ascertain its purpose while gauging the presence of misinformation or disinformation in educators' videos. The analysis encompassed 743 videos, revealing intriguing insights. Surprisingly, despite having less valuable content, teacher-generated TikToks had the most viewing. SPEDs and SLPs, on the other hand, took a different strategy. They provided targeted assistance to their target audience, including instructional information focused on professional growth, procedural insights, and caregiver counseling. These findings highlight TikTok's potential for enhancing educators' outreach and successfully conveying specialized information.

AB Connected vehicles (CVs) offer enhanced safety features and improved traffic management capabilities but face a critical concern-vulnerability to malicious attacks due to interconnectivity. To address this, trust algorithms have been developed to assess vehicle trustworthiness. However, in majority-malicious conditions, these algorithms may fail. This paper explores an algorithm based on the DeGroot opinion dynamics model to achieve consensus in such scenarios, aiming to distinguish between benevolent and malicious vehicles. The model successfully identified benevolent and malicious vehicles in up to 98% corruption with an average F1 score of 0.96 on three different datasets namely motion model, open source traffic simulator, and real-world dataset.

AB Garnet U-Pb dating by laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry requires the development of matrix-matched reference materials of variable chemistry and U mass fraction for accurate analysis. Additional calibration of existing primary reference materials is also justified based on the relatively poor calibration of some of the widely available primary reference materials that are currently utilised by the geoscience community. We present a micro sampling workflow combined with a refined ID-TIMS methodology for the generation of high precision (similar to 0.1%) U-Pb dates from domains within garnet single crystals. Using this workflow, we calibrated two new natural andradite reference materials, the Jumbo andradite (And(99); 110.34 +/- 0.03 (0.04) [0.13] Ma, n =7, MSWD = 1.21) and the Tiptop andradite (And(87); 209.57 +/- 0.11 (0.13) [0.26] Ma, n =6, MSWD = 1.39). We also present additional calibration of the widely utilised Willsboro-Lewis andradite primary reference material (And(90); 1024.7 +/- 9.5 (9.6) [9.6] Ma (2s; overdispersed), n =6). Wafers of the Jumbo and Tiptop andradite reference materials are available from the authors upon request.

AB The variety of new electronic packaging technologies has grown signiicantly over the last 20 years as a result of market demands for higher device performance at lower costs and in less space. Those demands have pushed for heterogeneous packaging, where computer chips with different stack heights are closely packed, creating nonuniform heat flux and temperature and additional challenges for thermal management. Without implementing an appropriate thermal management strategy for heterogeneous packages, large temperature gradients can be observed within the package, which would increase the thermal stresses on the chip and raise reliability issues. To mimic this real-life scenario of such packaging, an experimental setup was designed and built. The design of the new experimental setup consists of four identical 1.2 cm x 1.2 cm ceramic heaters, each of which is connected to a separate power supply and can reach a heat flux of 140 W/cm2. Accordingly, this mock package is capable of delivering different power levels to mimic different multicore microprocessor conditions. To give the heater the ability to move precisely in the x- , y- , and z-directions, each heater is mounted to an XYZ linear stage. Deionized water (DI) was used as the working fluid, and a pin-in heat sink was used to run the initial steady-state tests on the experimental rig. The tests showed how different flow rates at a constant fluid temperature and input power affect the temperatures of the heaters and the thermohydraulic performance of the heat sink. In addition, a three-dimensional numerical model has been developed and validated with experimental data in terms of heat sink pressure drop and the temperatures of the heaters.

ID NORMAL BASES
AB An irreducible polynomial f is an element of F-q[X] of degree n is normal over F-q if and only if its roots r, r(q),& mldr;,r(qn-1) satisfy the condition Delta(n)(r,r(q),& mldr;,r(qn-1)) not equal 0, where Delta(n)(X-0,& mldr;,Xn-1) is the n x n circulant determinant. By finding a suitable symmetrization of Delta(n) (A multiple of Delta(n) which is symmetric in X-0,& mldr;,Xn-1), we obtain a condition on the coefficients of f that is sufficient for f to be normal. This approach works well for n <= 5 but encounters computational difficulties when n >= 6. In the present paper, we consider irreducible polynomials of the form f = X-n+Xn-1+ a is an element of F-q[X]. For n = 6 and 7, by an indirect method, we are able to find simple conditions on a that are sufficient for f to be normal. In a more general context, we also explore the normal polynomials of a finite Galois extension through the irreducible characters of the Galois group. (c) 2024 Elsevier Inc.

AB Despite efforts to raise awareness of societal and ethical issues in CS education, research shows students often do not act upon their new awareness (Problem 1). One such issue, well-established by HCI research, is that much of technology contains barriers impacting numerous populations-such as minoritized genders, races, ethnicities, and more. HCI has inclusive design methods that help-but these skills are rarely taught, even in HCI classes (Problem 2). To address Problems 1 and 2, we created the Matchmaker Curriculum to pair CS faculty-including non-HCI faculty-with inclusive design elements to allow for inclusive design skill-building throughout their CS program. We present the curriculum and a field study, in which we followed 18 faculty along their journey. The results show how the Matchmaker Curriculum equipped 88% of these faculty with enough inclusive design teaching knowledge to successfully embed actionable inclusive design skill-building into 13 CS courses.

   ARCADE; MODEL; TUBE
AB We report on two case studies regarding the magnetic flux rope (MFR) structure of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) near the Sun and at 1 au. The event is a stealth streamer blow-out CME on 2011 March 25 from AR11176 showing a typical three-part bubble-like flux rope structure. No apparent eruptive signatures (e.g., two-ribbon flare, and post-eruption arcade (PEA)) were detected in the solar disk images; but a faint eruptive prominence (EP) was seen at the limb in STEREO EUV images along with a few confined flares before the eruption. The second event is a CME on 2018 August 20 originating from a quiescent filament region with clear two-ribbon flare and PEA observed; and the prolonged CME acceleration coincides with the GOES X-ray flare light curve and reconnected (RC) flux (Gopalswamy et al., 2022). In both cases, a well-defined magnetic cloud (MC) is detected at 1 au after similar to 5 days. The two MCs have similar magnetic field magnitude and poloidal flux, however, the RC fluxes estimated from the associated solar source regions are significantly different. Our detailed analysis suggests the following. 1) The two events share a similar kinematic pattern consisting of a slow-rise phase and a main acceleration phase. 2) In the first case, the RC flux of the associated trigger flare at AR11176 is much smaller than the MC poloidal flux at 1au, and a significant amount of poloidal flux has been added through reconnection during the eruption. 3) Both cases show that the post-eruption flux rope has a lower twist at the core and a higher twist at the edge of the flux rope. In addition, we find that the MCs may deviate from a force-free state at the edge of flux rope. A non-force-free, varying-twist Gold-Hoyle (GH) model provides a better fit to the boundaries of the flux rope than the Lundquist (LQ) fit.

AB As fused filament fabrication (FFF) continues to gain popularity, many studies are turning to nanomaterials or optimization of printing parameters to improve the materials' properties; however, many overlook how materials formulation and additive manufacturing (AM) processes cooperatively engineer the evolution of properties across length scales. Evaluating the in-process evolution of the nanocomposite using AM will provide a fundamental understanding of the material's microstructure, which can be tailored to create unique characteristics in functionality and performance. In this study, the crystallinity behavior of polyetheretherketone (PEEK) was studied in the presence of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as a nucleation aid for improved crystallization during FFF processing. Using various characterization techniques and molecular dynamics simulations, it was discovered that the crystallization behavior of extruded filaments is very different from that of 3D printed roads. Additionally, the printed material exhibited cold crystallization, and the CNT addition increased the crystallization of printed roads, which were amorphous without CNT addition. Tensile strength and modulus were increased by as much as 42 and 51%, respectively, due to higher crystallinity during printing. Detailed knowledge on the morphology of PEEK-CNT used in FFF allows gaining a fundamental understanding of the morphological evolution occurring during the AM process that in turn enables formulating materials for the AM process to achieve tailored mechanical and functional properties, such as crystallinity or conductivity.

AB Grid displays are the most common form of augmentative and alternative communication device recommended by speech-language pathologists for children. Grid displays present a large variety of vocabulary which can be beneficial for a users' language development. However, the extensive navigation and cognitive overhead required of users of grid displays can negatively impact users' ability to actively participate in social interactions, which is an important factor of their language development. We present a novel interaction technique for grid displays, Predictive Anchoring, based on user interaction theory and language development theory. Our design is informed by existing literature in AAC research, presented in the form of a set of design goals and a preliminary design sketch. Future work in user studies and interaction design are also discussed.

AB This paper examines the effect of viscoelasticity on the dynamic behavior of a bistable dome-shaped structure represented as a lumped parameter viscoelastic von Mises truss. The viscoelastic system is governed by a third order jerk equation. The presence of viscoelasticity also introduces additional time scales and degrees of freedom into the problem when compared to their viscous counterparts, thus making the study of these systems in the presence of harmonic loading even more interesting. It is highly likely that the system would exhibit non-regular behavior for some combination of forcing frequency and forcing amplitude. With this motivation, we start by studying the dynamics of a harmonically forced von Mises truss in the presence of viscous damping only. This leads to a Duffing type equation with an additional quadratic non-linearity. We demonstrate some of the rich dynamic behavior that this system exhibits in some parameter ranges. This provides useful insight into the possible behavior of the viscoelastic system. The viscous damper is then replaced by a viscoelastic unit. We show that the system can exhibit both regular as well as chaotic behavior. The threshold limit for the chaotic motion has been determined using Melnikov's criteria and verified through numerical simulations using the largest Lyapunov exponent.

AB Mesostructured and nanocrystalline cerium oxide materials with a coral-like structure were self-assembled using amino acids as templates. The samples were characterized by N-2-adsorption, XRD, SEM, and Raman spectroscopy. The influence of the amino acid structure and composition on the final CeO2 nanodomain structure and crystal size was investigated. The XRD and Raman data indicate a direct correlation between the amino and carboxylic group positions in the structure of linear-, branched, and ring-amino acids and the crystal size of CeO2, Which ranges from 6 to 30 nm in diameter. In contrast, the final coral-like nanodomain structures are independent on the amino acid used as template. The results demonstrate a synthetic method for hierarchical architectures in which the final CeO2 crystal size can be controlled by the use of amino acids in the self-assembly process.

AB The unique properties and sustainability advantages of sulfur polymer cement have led to efforts to use them as alternatives to traditional Portland cement. The current study explores the impact of environmental stresses on the strength development of polymer composite SunBG90, a material composed of animal and plant fats/oils vulcanized with 90 wt. % sulfur. The environmental stresses investigated include low temperature (-25 degrees C), high temperature (40 degrees C), and submersion in water, hexanes, or aqueous solutions containing strong electrolyte, strong acid, or strong base. Samples were analyzed for the extent to which exposure to these stresses influenced the thermo-morphological properties and the compressional strength of the materials compared to identical materials allowed to develop strength at room temperature. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis revealed distinct thermos-morphological transitions in stressed samples and the notable formation of metastable gamma-sulfur in hexane-exposed specimens. Powder X-ray diffraction confirmed that the crystalline domains identified by DSC were primarily gamma-sulfur, with similar to 5% contribution of gamma-sulfur in hexane-exposed samples. Compressive strength testing revealed high strength retention other than aging at elevated temperatures, which led to similar to 50% loss of strength. These findings reveal influences on the strength development of SunBG90, lending important insight into possible use as an alternative to OPC.

AB While crowdsourcing is commonly used for objective labeling, eliciting subjective annotations, like estimating mental states or perception of other's intention, remains challenging. This study investigates crowdsourcing's potential to predict pedestrian behavioral intentions. We recruited 120 participants to predict pedestrian intentions at different prediction horizons in 24 diverse videos. Our findings revealed that the status-quo bias significantly impacts intention estimation. Specifically, when asked what status the pedestrian will be, predictions inclined towards current state's continuation over transition, with an overall accuracy of 53% at one-second prediction length on a balanced dataset. Rephrasing the annotation question mitigates this bias and improved the estimation accuracy to 79% for one-second ahead predictions, though accuracy drops with longer horizons and is affected by pedestrian actions and contextual information. Overall, this study provides insights into the factors affecting collective estimation of pedestrian intentions and aims to improve crowdsourcing cognitive labels for training better AV-pedestrian interaction algorithms.

AB A significant hurdle in developing high-performance semiconductor quantum technologies utilizing deep defects is related to charge dynamics. Unfortunately, progress in modeling their charge dynamics has been hindered over recent decades due to the absence of appropriate multiscale models capable of accurately representing the atomic properties of these defects and their impact on device performance. Here, we present a semi- ab initio method for modeling the bound states of deep defects in semiconductor quantum technologies, applied to the negatively charged nitrogen vacancy (NV-) center in diamond. We employ density functional theory calculations to construct accurate potentials for an effective mass model, which allow us to unveil the structure of the bound hole states. We develop a model to calculate the nonradiative capture cross sections, which agrees with experiment within one order of magnitude. Finally, we present our attempt at constructing the photoionization spectrum of NV0 -> NV- + bound hole, showing that the electronic transitions of the bound holes can be distinguished from phonon sidebands. This paper offers a practical and efficient solution to a long-standing challenge in understanding the charge dynamics of deep defects.

AB The exacerbated thermal environment in cities, with the urban heat island (UHI) effect as a prominent example, has been the source of many adverse urban environmental issues, including the increase of health risks, degradation of air quality and ecosystem services, and reduced resiliency of engineering infrastructure. Last decades have witnessed tremendous efforts and resources being invested to find sustainable solutions for urban heat mitigation, whereas the relative contributions of different UHI attributes and their patterns of spatiotemporal variability remain obscure. In this study, we employed the random forest (RF) method to quantify the relative importance of four categories of urban surface characteristics that regulate the surface UHI, namely the urban greenery fraction, land surface albedo, urban morphology, and level of human activities. We selected seventeen major cities from six megaregions in China as our study areas, with the RF training and test sets obtained from multi-sourced remote sensing and observational data products. It is found that the urban greenery coverage manifests as the most important environmental determinants of UHI, followed by surface albedo. The results are informative for urban planners, policymakers, and engineering practitioners to design and implement sustainable strategies for urban heat mitigation.

TI Engineering students' epistemic affect and meta-affect in solving
   ill-defined problems
SO JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
DE affect; emotion; interviews; problem solving; undergraduate
AB Background: Real-world engineering problems are ill-defined and complex, and solving them may arouse negative epistemic affect (feelings experienced within problem-solving). These feelings fall into sequenced patterns (affective pathways). Over time, these patterns can alter students' attitudes toward engineering. Meta-affect (affect or cognition about affect) can shape or reframe affective pathways, changing a student's problem-solving experience. Purpose/Hypothesis(es): This paper examines epistemic affect and meta-affect in undergraduate students solving ill-defined problems called open-ended modeling problems (OEMPs), addressing two research questions: What epistemic affect and transitions between different affective states do students report? And, how does meta-affect shape students' affective experiences? Design/Method: We examined 11 retrospective interviews with nine students performed across two semesters in which students completed OEMPs. Using inductive and deductive coding with discourse analysis, we systematically searched for expressions conveying epistemic affect and for transitions in affect; we performed additional deductive coding of the transcripts for meta-affect and synthesized these results to formulate narratives related to affect and meta-affect. Results: Together, the expressions, transitions, and meta-affect suggest different types of student experiences. Depending on their meta-affect, students either recounted experiences dominated by positive or negative affect, or else they experienced negative emotions as productive. Conclusion: sIll-defined complex problems elicit a wide range of positive and negative emotions and provide opportunities to practice affective regulation and productive meta-affect. Viewing the OEMPs as authentic disciplinary experiences and/or the ability to view negative emotions as productive can enable overall positive experiences. Our results provide insight into how instructors can foster positive affective pathways through problem-scaffolding or their interactions with students.

ID BYSTANDER BEHAVIOR; CONTEXT; DETERMINANTS
AB Cyberbullying harms teenagers' mental health, and teaching them upstanding intervention is crucial. Wizard-of-Oz studies show chatbots can scale up personalized and interactive cyberbullying education, but implementing such chatbots is a challenging and delicate task. We created a no-code chatbot design tool for K-12 teachers. Using large language models and prompt chaining, our tool allows teachers to prototype bespoke dialogue flows and chatbot utterances. In offering this tool, we explore teachers' distinctive needs when designing chatbots to assist their teaching, and how chatbot design tools might better support them. Our findings reveal that teachers welcome the tool enthusiastically. Moreover, they see themselves as playwrights guiding both the students' and the chatbot's behaviors, while allowing for some improvisation. Their goal is to enable students to rehearse both desirable and undesirable reactions to cyberbullying in a safe environment. We discuss the design opportunities LLM-Chains offer for empowering teachers and the research opportunities this work opens up.

AB This study addresses the challenge of selecting sensors for linear time-varying (LTV) systems dynamically. We present a framework that designs an online sparse sensor schedule with performance guarantees using randomized algorithms for large-scale LTV systems. Our approach calculates each sensor's contribution at each time in real-time and immediately decides whether to keep or discard the sensor in the schedule, with no possibility of reversal. Additionally, we provide new performance guarantees that approximate the fully-sensed LTV system with a multiplicative approximation factor and an additive one by using a constant average number of active sensors at each time. We demonstrate the validity of our findings through several numerical examples. (c) 2024 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Bituminous coal was utilized as a particulate filler in polymer-based composites to fabricate standard 1.75 mm coal-plastic composite filaments for material extrusion 3D printing. The composites were formulated by incorporating Pittsburgh No. 8 coal into polylactic acid, polyethylene terephthalate glycol, high-density polyethylene, and polyamide-12 resins with loadings ranging from 20 to 70 wt %. Coal-plastic composite filaments were extruded and printed by using the same processing parameters as the respective neat plastics. The introduction of coal ameliorated the warping problem of 3D printed high-density polyethylene, allowing for additive manufacturing of an inexpensive and widely available thermoplastic. The mechanical properties of the 3D printed composites were characterized and compared to those of composites fabricated using traditional compression molding. Microscopy of as-fractured samples revealed that particle pull-out and particle fracture were the predominant modes of composite failure. Tensile and flexural moduli as well as hardness had direct proportionality with increasing coal content, while flexural strength, tensile strength, and impact resistance decreased for most composite formulations. Interestingly, polyamide-based composites demonstrated greater maximum tensile and flexural strengths than unfilled plastic. Investigation of composite interfacial chemistry via molecular dynamics simulations and Fourier-transform spectroscopy revealed beneficial hydrogen bonding interactions between coal and polyamide-12, while no chemical reactions were evident for the other polymers investigated.

AB Observed scatter in the Lya opacity of quasar sightlines at z < 6 has motivated measurements of the correlation between Ly alpha opacity and galaxy density, as models that predict this scatter make strong and sometimes opposite predictions for how they should be related. Our previous work associated two highly opaque Ly alpha troughs at z similar to 5.7 with a deficit of Ly alpha emitting galaxies (LAEs). In this work, we survey two of the most highly transmissive lines of sight at this redshift toward the z = 6.02 quasar SDSS J1306+0356 and the z = 6.17 quasar PSO J359-06. We find that both fields are underdense in LAEs within 10 h(-1) Mpc of the quasar sightline, somewhat less extensive than underdensities associated with Ly alpha troughs. We combine our observations with three additional fields from the literature and find that while fields with extreme opacities are generally underdense, moderate opacities span a wider density range. The results at high opacities are consistent with models that invoke UV background fluctuations and/or late reionization to explain the observed scatter in intergalactic medium (IGM) Ly alpha opacities. There is tension at low opacities, however, as the models tend to associate lower IGM Ly alpha opacities with higher densities. Although the number of fields surveyed is still small, the low-opacity results may support a scenario in which the ionizing background in low-density regions increases more rapidly than some models suggest after becoming ionized. Elevated gas temperatures from recent reionization may also be making these regions more transparent.

AB The tantalum carbides, TaCx, have been repeatedly shown to harden dramatically with some loss of carbon content, then soften with further decarburization. First observed in 1963, this anomalous hardness behavior has been reproduced for decades without satisfactory explanation. Prior attempts to characterize this phenomenon using elastic stiffnesses have failed to reproduce the anomalous hardness behavior. In this work, we demonstrate a change in slip system preference from {111}B1 to {110}B1 in TaCx as x decreases, while no such transition is observed in TiCx. We find this to be the primary mechanism of the anomalous hardness, arising from reduced energetic favorability of dissociation of dislocations on {111}B1 into Shockley partials at lower carbon contents. We also present experimental hardness measurements for bulk and thin-film TaCx at different carbon contents. An anomalous hardness peak is observed in the bulk samples, but not in the thin films, due to loss of dislocation plasticity in the nanocrystalline films.

AB We develop a polycrystal graph neural network (PGNN) model for predicting the effective properties of poly-crystalline materials, using the Li7La3Zr2O12 ceramic as an example. A large-scale dataset with >5000 different three-dimensional polycrystalline microstructures of finite-width grain boundary is generated by Voronoi tessellation and processing of the electron backscatter diffraction images. The effective ion conductivities and elastic stiffness coefficients of these microstructures are calculated by high-throughput physics-based simula-tions. The optimized PGNN model achieves a low error of <1.4% in predicting all three diagonal components of the effective Li-ion conductivity matrix, outperforming a linear regression model and two baseline convolutional neural network models. Sequential forward selection method is used to quantify the relative importance of selecting individual grain (boundary) features to improving the property prediction accuracy, through which both the critical and unwanted node (edge) feature can be determined. The extrapolation performance of the trained PGNN model is also investigated. The transfer learning performance is evaluated by using the PGNN model pretrained for predicting conductivities to predict the elastic properties of the same set of microstructures. :

AB Phylogenetic placement is the computational task that places a query taxon into a reference phylogeny using computational analysis of biomolecular sequence data or other evolutionary characters. A chief advantage of phylogenetic placement over one-shot phylogenetic reconstruction is greatly reduced computational requirements, and the former has been applied in many different topics in phylogenetics. One of the more recent applications has been enabled by rapid advances in biomolecular sequencing technology: classification of genomes, metagenomes, and metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) in large-scale datasets produced by next-generation sequencing. A number of methods have been developed for this purpose, and all share the common simplifying assumption that a phylogenetic tree suffices for modeling the evolutionary history of all genomes and/or metagenomes under study. Another parallel development in today's post-genomic era is a greater understanding of the prevalence and importance of non-tree-like evolution in the Tree of Life - the evolutionary history of all life on Earth - which in fact may not be a tree at all. More general graph representations such as phylogenetic networks have therefore been proposed, and a new generation of phylogenetic network reconstruction methods are under active development. But the simplifying assumption made by phylogenetic tree placement methods is fundamentally at odds with the non-tree-like evolutionary histories of many microbes and other organisms. The consequences of this conflict are poorly understood.
   In this study, we conduct a comprehensive performance study to directly assess the impact of non-tree-like evolution on phylogenetic tree placement of genomes and metagenomes. Our study includes in silico simulation experiments as well as empirical data analyses. We find that the topological accuracy of phylogenetic tree placement degrades quickly as genomic sequence evolution becomes increasingly non-tree-like. We then introduce a new statistical method for phylogenetic network placement of genomes and metagenomes, which we refer to as NetPlacer version 0. Initial experiments with NetPlacer provide a proof-of-concept, but also point to the need for greater computational scalability. We conclude with thoughts on algorithmic techniques to enable fast and accurate phylogenetic network placement.

DT Article
AB This article presents the Ensemble Nucleotide Byte-level Encoder-Decoder (ENBED) foundation model, analyzing DNA sequences at byte-level precision with an encoder-decoder Transformer architecture. ENBED uses a subquadratic implementation of attention to develop an efficient model capable of sequence-to-sequence transformations, generalizing previous genomic models with encoder-only or decoder-only architectures. We use Masked Language Modeling to pretrain the foundation model using reference genome sequences and apply it in the following downstream tasks: (i) identification of enhancers, promotors, and splice sites, (ii) recognition of sequences containing base call mismatches and insertion/deletion errors, an advantage over tokenization schemes involving multiple base pairs, which lose the ability to analyze with byte-level precision, (iii) identification of biological function annotations of genomic sequences, and (iv) generating mutations of the Influenza virus using the encoder-decoder architecture and validating them against real-world observations. In each of these tasks, we demonstrate significant improvement as compared to the existing state-of-the-art results.Availability and implementation The source code used to develop and fine-tune the foundation model has been released on Github (https://github.itap.purdue.edu/Clan-labs/ENBED).

AB We investigate the impact of differential vaccine effectiveness, waning immunity, and natural cross-immunity on the capacity for vaccine-induced strain replacement in two-strain models of infectious disease spread. We focus specifically on the case where the first strain is more transmissible but the second strain is more immune-resistant. We consider two cases on vaccine-induced immunity: (1) a monovalent model where the second strain has immune escape with respect to vaccination; and (2) a bivalent model where the vaccine remains equally effective against both strains. Our analysis reaffirms the capacity for vaccine-induced strain replacement under a variety of circumstances; surprisingly, however, we find that which strain is preferred depends sensitively on the degree of differential vaccine effectiveness. In general, the monovalent model favors the more immune-resistant strain at high vaccination levels while the bivalent model favors the more transmissible strain at high vaccination levels. To further investigate this phenomenon, we parametrize the bifurcation space between the monovalent and bivalent model.

AB A three-stage route to chemically upcycle post-consumer poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) to produce high compressive strength composites is reported. This procedure involves initial glycolysis with diethylene glycol to produce a mixture (GPET) comprising oligomers of 2-7 terephthalate units followed by trans/esterification of GPET with fatty acid chains supplied by brown grease, an agricultural by-product of animal fat of relatively low nutritional or fuel value. This process yields PGB comprising a mixture of mono-terephthalate ester derivatives. The olefin units provided by unsaturated fatty acid chains in brown grease were crosslinked by an inverse vulcanization reaction with elemental sulfur to give composites GBSx (x = wt% S, varied from 80%-90%). The compressive strengths of GBS(80) (27.5 +/- 2.6 MPa) and GBS90 (19.2 +/- 0.8 MPa) exceed the compressive strength required of ordinary Portland cement (17 MPa) for its use in residential building foundations. The current route represents a way to repurpose waste plastic, energy sector by-product sulfur, and agricultural by-product brown grease to give high strength composites with mechanical properties suggesting their possible use to replace less sustainably sourced legacy structural materials.

AB In several two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), lithium intercalation has been observed to induce a phase transition from the 2H phase to the 1T ' phase in the TMDs, leading to improvements in various applications. For MoTe2, calculations have also predicted the same phase transition under the influence of electron doping, strain, or lithium intercalation. In this work, however, we experimentally demonstrate that electrochemically controlled lithium intercalation does not lead to the predicted phase change in 2H-MoTe2. Instead, the 2H-MoTe2 directly decomposes to molybdenum (Mo), tellurium (Te), and lithium telluride (Li2Te) upon lithiation despite the significant electron doping achieved by the lithium intercalation into 2H-MoTe2 flakes, probed using in situ Raman spectroscopy and in situ conductivity measurements. Performing the lithium intercalation on 2H-MoTe2 flakes at higher temperatures also did not result in the 1T ' phase, suggesting that additional thermal energy did not facilitate the phase transition. Thus, our experiments directly challenge the theoretical prediction and point to a potentially high nucleation barrier for the 1T ' phase in MoTe2. Our findings emphasize the importance of studying the phase transition pathways for lithium intercalation-induced phase transitions in 2D TMDs.

AB Inverse scattering is broadly applicable in quantum mechanics, remote sensing, geophysical, and medical imaging. This paper presents a robust direct non-iterative reduced order model (ROM) method for solving inverse scattering problems based on an efficient approximation of the resolvent operator, resulting in the regularized Lippmann-Schwinger-Lanczos (LSL) algorithm. We show that the efficiency of the method relies upon the weak dependence of the orthogonalized basis on the unknown potential in the Schr & ouml;dinger equation by demonstrating that the Lanczos orthogonalization is equivalent to performing Gram-Schmidt on the ROM time snapshots. We then develop the LSL algorithm in the frequency domain with two levels of regularization. The proposed bi-level regularization of the algorithm represents a significant advancement in computational stability, enabling its application to real data sets that are larger than used previously with LSL and inherently contain errors. We show that the same procedure can be extended beyond the Schr & ouml;dinger formulation to the diffusive Helmholtz equation, e.g., to imaging the conductivity using diffusive electromagnetic fields in conductive media with localized positive conductivity perturbations. Numerical experiments for diffusive Helmholtz and Schr & ouml;dinger problems show that the proposed bi-level regularization scheme significantly improves the performance of the LSL algorithm, allowing for accurate reconstructions with noisy data and large data sets.

AB In the classical Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability, initial conditions are forgotten and the growth of the mixing layer becomes self-similar when short wavelength modes couple to generate longer wavelength modes. In this paper, we explore how adding a reaction at the unstable interface affects this inverse cascade in wavenumber ("inverse k-cascade"). We simulate a 2D, Boussinesq, premixed model flame perturbed by a large amplitude primary mode (k1) and a smaller amplitude secondary mode (k2). Early on, the modes are uncoupled and the flame propagates as a metastable traveling wave. Once the secondary mode has grown large enough, the modes couple. The traveling wave is destabilized and the flame front bubbles rapidly grow. This inverse k-cascade, driven by two-mode coupling, ultimately generates a long wavelength mode with wavenumber GCD(k1, k2), where GCD is the greatest common divisor. We identify five distinct flame growth solution types and show that the flame may stall, develop coherent pulsations, or even become a metastable traveling wave again depending on GCD(k1, k2). Finally, we compare our results with two-mode coupling in ablative and classical RT and show that all three systems may follow the same mode coupling dynamics.

AB This study presents an approach for structural health monitoring (SHM) of remote and hazardous structures using unpiloted aerial vehicles (UAVs). The method focuses on overcoming the challenges associated with traditional sensor deployment techniques, which are often costly and risky due to the decaying nature of the targeted structures. Utilizing a multi-rotor UAV platform, a streaming camera is integrated into a recovery cone to aid in visual alignment during deployment and retrieval providing a safe and cost-effective means of sensor delivery. The paper covers the design of a video-broadcasting deployment system with integrated electropermanent magnets (EPMs), housed in a 3D-printed recovery cone, supplemented by redundancy measures to enhance safety and reliability. This proposed system significantly improves the user's spatial awareness and aids in precise sensor package alignment, facilitated by multiple camera views providing a dual purpose of conducting visual inspection in addition to aiding in sensor delivery. The experimental analysis presented in this study validates the system's effectiveness, demonstrating the utility of camera-aided sensor delivery for rapid SHM applications. Navigation challenges due to proximity to metal structures and the difficulties associated with signal strength and reflections are also reported. The contribution of this work is a methodology for aerial sensor deployment and retrieval using a lightweight 3D-printed recovery cone with integrated cameras for navigation and sensor alignment.

AB The excessive warming in the built environment, due to urbanization and anthropogenic heat emissions, has adverse effects on building energy consumption. Diverse technology using, e.g., vegetated roofs or innovative roof materials, have been proposed and implemented to ameliorate both indoor and outdoor thermal environments and reduce energy consumption. In this study, we apply a state-of-the-art urban canopy model to simulate the thermal performance of multiple roof technology, viz. the white, green, and hybrid roofs, in the contrasting urban environments of Princeton, NJ and Phoenix, AZ, USA. In addition, we estimate the combined energy-water saving potential for green roofs with five different irrigation schemes. It is found that green roofs can achieve a combined energy-water saving of $9.68 m(-2) roof area in Phoenix with moisture-controlled irrigation, and $5.23 m(-2) in Princeton without irrigation. These results can help to promote building energy efficiency by adapting to flexible and sustainable roof technology for heat mitigation.

AB The observation of X-rays during quiescence from transiently accreting neutron stars provides unique clues about the nature of dense matter. This, however, requires extensive modeling of the crusts and matching the results to observations. The pycnonuclear fusion reaction rates implemented in these models are theoretically calculated by extending phenomenological expressions and have large uncertainties spanning many orders of magnitude. We present the first sensitivity studies of these pycnonuclear fusion reactions in realistic network calculations. We also couple the reaction network with the thermal evolution code dStar to further study their impact on the neutron star cooling curves in quiescence. Varying the pycnonuclear fusion reaction rates alters the depth at which nuclear heat is deposited although the total heating remains constant. The enhancement of the pycnonuclear fusion reaction rates leads to an overall shallower deposition of nuclear heat. The impurity factors are also altered depending on the type of ashes deposited on the crust. These total changes correspond to a variation of up to 9 eV in the modeled cooling curves. While this is not sufficient to explain the shallow heat source, it is comparable to the observational uncertainties and can still be important for modeling the neutron star crust.

AB Using methods of DFT, we investigated the effect of electron withdrawing and electron donating groups on the relative stability of tentative glycosyl donor reaction intermediates. The calculation shows that by changing the stereoelectronic properties of the protecting group, we can influence the stability of the dioxolenium type of intermediates by up to 10 kcal mol-1, and that by increasing nucleophillicity of the 4-O-Bz group, the dioxolenium intermediate becomes more stable than a triflate-donor pair. We exploited this mechanism to design galactosyl donors with custom protecting groups on O2 and O4, and investigated the outcome of the reaction with cyclohexanol. The reaction showed no change in the product distribution, which suggests that the neighboring group participation takes precedence over remote group participation due to kinetic barriers.

DE Time series forecasting; Vertical Learning; Distributed Optimization
AB In this work, we propose a distributed time series forecasting framework for scenarios where multiple computing nodes collaboratively make predictions using only locally available data streams. Our proposed framework utilizes a hierarchical architecture, consisting of multiple local models and a global model, and provides an efficient training algorithm to achieve high prediction accuracy. Key features of the framework are: (i) Simple collaboration, where a carefully designed global model enables the system to leverage the correlations among different local streams; (ii) Flexibility, where each node can choose its local model from a wide variety of prediction models (e.g., RNNs or Transformers) suitable to its compute resources; (iii) Privacy and communication efficiency, where messages communicated between the nodes are low-dimensional embeddings. The proposed approach's effectiveness is demonstrated theoretically and numerically using a number of time series forecasting tasks, with the (surprising) observation that the proposed distributed models can match or even outperform centralized ones.

AB The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly in the domains of robotics, prosthetics, and virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR), have driven an escalating demand for intuitive and effective human-machine interactions. Consequently, haptic devices, being electronic displays for the sense of touch, have drawn increasing attention. More efforts are in demand to develop stretchable and lightweight haptic devices that can trigger multiple mechanical cutaneous receptors using a single device. This work presents a new 3-modal 5-DOF stretchable haptic interface that is enabled by electromagnetic actuators and high-fidelity multi-layer metal printing. The haptic device renders rich haptic sensations (i.e., normal force, vibration, angular force, skin dragging) in one device, allowing for the comprehensive delivery of tactile information through the excitation of multiple cutaneous receptors. Additionally, haptic devices are designed to be compact, lightweight, and skin-compatible. The skin-like softness and stretchability enable intimate skin contact, which is crucial for efficient haptic information delivery. This feature prevents the impediment to natural movements of the skin and ensures the functional integrity of the device during daily deformations of the skin. Finally, three proof-of-concept demonstrations illustrate the potential of the reported multimodal haptic devices for advanced haptic interactions across various domains.

AB Self-assembled networks of bottlebrush copolymers are promising materials for biomedical applications due to a unique combination of ultra-softness and strain-adaptive stiffening, characteristic of soft biological tissues. Transitioning from ABA linear-brush-linear triblock copolymers to A-g-B bottlebrush graft copolymer architectures allows significant increasing the mechanical strength of thermoplastic elastomers. Using real-time synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering, it is shown that annealing of A-g-B elastomers in a selective solvent for the linear A blocks allows for substantial network reconfiguration, resulting in an increase of both the A domain size and the distance between the domains. The corresponding increases in the aggregation number and extension of bottlebrush strands lead to a significant increase of the strain-stiffening parameter up to 0.7, approaching values characteristic of the brain and skin tissues. Network reconfiguration without disassembly is an efficient approach to adjusting the mechanical performance of tissue-mimetic materials to meet the needs of diverse biomedical applications.
   The effect of annealing on the mechanical properties and structure of bottlebrush A-g-B graft copolymers is studied. It is shown that the strain-stiffening parameter can be increased up to 0.7 by annealing the copolymers in a solvent selective for the linear A block. This brings the mechanical properties of the copolymers closer to soft biological tissues, such as the brain and skin. image

TI Proximity effect of s-wave superconductor on an inversion-broken Weyl
   semimetal
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
LA English
DT Article
AB Inducing superconductivity in systems with unconventional band structures is a promising approach for realizing unconventional superconductivity. Of particular interest are single-interface or Josephson junction architectures involving Weyl semimetals (WSM), which are predicted to host odd-parity, potentially topological, superconducting states. These expectations rely crucially on the tunneling of electronic states at the interface between the two systems. In this study, we revisit the question of induced superconductivity in an inversionbroken WSM via quantum tunneling, treating the interface as an effective potential barrier. We determine the conditions under which the gap function couples to the Weyl physics and its properties within the WSM. Our simulations show that the mismatch in the nature of the low-energy electronic states leads to a rapid decay of the superconductivity within the semimetal.

TI Strain-Driven Stabilization of a Room-Temperature Chiral Multiferroic
   with Coupled Ferroaxial and Ferroelectric Order
SO ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS

DE chalcogenides; chirality; ferroaxial; ferroelectricity; multiferroics
AB Noncollinear ferroic materials are sought after as testbeds to explore the intimate connections between topology and symmetry, which result in electronic, optical, and magnetic functionalities not observed in collinear ferroic materials. For example, ferroaxial materials have rotational structural distortions that break mirror symmetry and induce chirality. When ferroaxial order is coupled with ferroelectricity arising from a broken inversion symmetry, it offers the prospect of electric-field-control of the ferroaxial distortions and opens up new tunable functionalities. However, chiral multiferroics, especially ones stable at room temperature, are rare. A strain-stabilized, room-temperature chiral multiferroic phase in single crystals of BaTiS3 is reported here. Using first-principles calculations, the stabilization of this multiferroic phase having P63 space group for biaxial tensile strains exceeding 1.5% applied on the basal ab-plane of the room temperature P63cm phase of BaTiS3 is predicted. The chiral multiferroic phase is characterized by rotational distortions of TiS6 octahedra around the long c-axis and polar displacement of Ti atoms along the c-axis. The ferroaxial and ferroelectric distortions and their domains in P63-BaTiS3 are directly resolved using atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy. Landau-based phenomenological modeling predicts a strong coupling between the ferroelectric and the ferroaxial order making P63-BaTiS3 an attractive test bed for achieving electric-field-control of chirality.

AB Brush-like graft copolymers (A-g-B), in which linear A-blocks are randomly grafted onto the backbone of a brush-like B-block, exhibit intense strain-stiffening and high mechanical strength on par with load-bearing biological tissues such as skin and blood vessels. To elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying this tissue-mimetic behavior, in situ synchrotron X-ray scattering was measured during uniaxial stretching of bottlebrush- and comb-like graft copolymers with varying densities of poly(dimethyl siloxane) and poly(isobutylene) side chains. In an undeformed state, these copolymers revealed a single interference peak corresponding to the average spacing between the domains of linear A-blocks arranged in a disordered, liquid-like configuration. Under uniaxial stretching, the emergence of a distinct four-spot pattern in the small-angle region indicated the development of long-range order within the material. According to the affine deformation of a cubic lattice, the four-spot pattern's interference maxima correspond to 110 reflections upon stretching along the [111] axis of the body-centered unit cell. The experimental findings were corroborated by computer simulations of dissipative particle dynamics that confirmed the formation of a bcc domain structure.

AB The McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV), Antarctica's largest ice-free region, hosts unique terrestrial ecosystems, with biodiversity concentrated in the aquatic environments and surrounding soils. Despite being a scientific hub, the creation of the MDV Antarctic Specially Managed Area (ASMA) made significant steps toward protecting the environment from degradation from human usage. However, with sustained human presence within the MDV, increasing human activity across Antarctica, and aquatic ecosystems subject to environmental change, the effectiveness of current protections for biodiversity conservation requires evaluation. This study employs spatial analysis of MDV protected areas, streams, lakes, research camps, and tourist sites to assess the robustness of current protections, identify underprotected areas, and outline steps for future protection. Within the MDV ASMA, five smaller Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPAs) exist. Only two ASPAs contain streams, and only one with a full hydrologic catchment. With roughly 6% of the lotic habitat area protected by ASPAs, the MDV fall short of global goals for freshwater protection. Past successful management of the MDV shows the effectiveness of collaboration and early action, and amongst calls for ASPA network expansion and restructuring, the MDV has the opportunity to be at the forefront again and increase the protection of Antarctic aquatic ecosystems.

TI Benchmark suites instead of leaderboards for evaluating AI fairness
SO PATTERNS
LA English
DT Article
ID COMPETENCE
AB Benchmarks and leaderboards are commonly used to track the fairness impacts of artificial intelligence (AI) models. Many critics argue against this practice, since it incentivizes optimizing for metrics in an attempt to build the "most fair"AI model. However, this is an inherently impossible task since different applications have different considerations. While we agree with the critiques against leaderboards, we believe that the use of benchmarks can be reformed. Thus far, the critiques of leaderboards and benchmarks have become unhelpfully entangled. However, benchmarks, when not used for leaderboards, offer important tools for understanding a model. We advocate for collecting benchmarks into carefully curated "benchmark suites,"which can provide researchers and practitioners with tools for understanding the wide range of potential harms and trade-offs among different aspects of fairness. We describe the research needed to build these benchmark suites so that they can better assess different usage modalities, cover potential harms, and reflect diverse perspectives. By moving away from leaderboards and instead thoughtfully designing and compiling benchmark suites, we can better monitor and improve the fairness impacts of AI technology.

AB With growing use of hardware intellectual property (IP) based integrated circuits (IC) design and increasing reliance on a globalized supply chain, the threats to confidentiality of hardware IPs have emerged as major security concerns to the IP producers and owners. These threats are diverse, including reverse engineering (RE), piracy, cloning, and extraction of design secrets, and span different phases of electronics life cycle. The academic research community and the semiconductor industry have made significant efforts over the past decade on developing effective methodologies and CAD tools targeted to protect hardware IPs against these threats. These solutions include watermarking, logic locking, obfuscation, camouflaging, split manufacturing, and hardware redaction. This paper focuses on key topics on confidentiality of hardware IPs encompassing the major threats, protection approaches, security analysis, and metrics. It discusses the strengths and limitations of the major solutions in protecting hardware IPs against the confidentiality attacks, and future directions to address the limitations in the modern supply chain ecosystem.

AB Many existing object counting methods rely on density map estimation (DME) of the discrete grid representation by decoding extracted image semantic features from designed convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Relying on discrete density maps not only leads to information loss dependent on the original image resolution, but also has a scalability issue when analyzing high-resolution images with cubically increasing memory complexity. Furthermore, none of the existing methods can offer reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) for the derived count estimates. To overcome these limitations, we design UNcertainty-aware, hypernetwork-based Implicit neural representations for Counting (UNIC) to assign probabilities and the corresponding counting confidence over continuous spatial coordinates. We derive a sampling-based Bayesian counting loss function and develop the corresponding model training algorithm. UNIC outperforms existing methods on the Remote Sensing Object Counting (RSOC) dataset with reliable UQ and improved interpretability of the derived count estimates. Our code is available at https://github.com/SiyuanXu-tamu/UNIC.

AB Cities and regional authorities play a crucial role in driving climate action to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees C. Despite their critical importance, significant obstacles in data collection and variability in implementation complicate the assessment of their contributions. This study provides the largest analysis of climate efforts across more than 3,000 cities and 170 regions within the G20 nations, revealing a noticeable uptick in the adoption of medium- to long-term emissions reduction and net-zero targets post-2020. However, over 60% of these subnational entities are failing to meet their climate ambitions, with a larger percentage not achieving the reduction rates necessary to align with the 1.5 degrees C goal. These findings underscore the pressing need for enhanced accountability mechanisms for subnational climate actions. Implementing standardized reporting and boosting transparency are pivotal steps to ensure that local and regional efforts substantively contribute to achieving both national and global climate objectives.

AB Hybrid epoxy composites are highly considered for low-density applications due to the excellent specific strength and specific stiffness. Enhancements made to the epoxy matrix by addition of nanofillers like carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene (GNPs) have been studied in detail over the course of few decades. These enhancements not only help elevate the material properties of the matrix but also activate different failure mitigating mechanisms in the composite. Although highly beneficial, there are few shortcomings due to the challenging fabrication process of integrating such. Common problems like filler agglomeration, formation of voids, wrinkling and more can result in poor load transfer within the composite. Graphene quantum dots (GQDs), on the other hand are the smallest carbon-based filler which are known to promote more intimate contact with the matrix. Their small size enables simultaneous enhancement of stiffness, strength and toughness. In addition, functionalization of these materials enables other supramolecular interactions like hydrogen bonding which improve the interfacial interaction with the epoxy. This study provides a molecular dynamics (MD) workflow to model a single functionalized GQD embedded in an epoxy matrix and the effective mechanical response of the nanocomposite. Ten chemistries were developed with different oxygen-based functional groups which capture the effect of GQD on the mechanical properties of the nanocomposite. Uniaxial strain simulations revealed that a maximum strength gain of 56 % and stiffness gain of 18 % was computed by the oxidized GQD-epoxy nanocomposite. (c) 2024 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Molecular simulations of biomacromolecules that assemble into multimeric complexes remain a challenge due to computationally inaccessible length and time scales. Low-resolution and implicit-solvent coarse-grained modeling approaches using traditional nonbonded interactions (both pairwise and spherically isotropic) have been able to partially address this gap. However, these models may fail to capture the complex anisotropic interactions present at macromolecular interfaces unless higher-order interaction potentials are incorporated at the expense of the computational cost. In this work, we introduce an alternate and systematic approach to represent directional interactions at protein-protein interfaces by using virtual sites restricted to pairwise interactions. We show that virtual site interaction parameters can be optimized within a relative entropy minimization framework by using only information from known statistics between coarse-grained sites. We compare our virtual site models to traditional coarse-grained models using two case studies of multimeric protein assemblies and find that the virtual site models predict pairwise correlations with higher fidelity and, more importantly, assembly behavior that is morphologically consistent with experiments. Our study underscores the importance of anisotropic interaction representations and paves the way for more accurate yet computationally efficient coarse-grained simulations of macromolecular assembly in future research.

ID ALLOYS
AB Titanium-based metallic glasses (TBMGs) are attracting broad interest due to their simultaneous light weight, superhigh strength, and specific strength, exceptional wear- and corrosion-resistance and biocompatibility, desirable for electronic, biomedical, and aerospace applications. However, the glass-forming ability (GFA) of TBMGs, except some containing significant amount of toxic (Be) or precious (Pd, Ag) elements, is disappointingly low, as manifested by a critical casting diameter (d(c)) not more than 6 mm, which significantly restricts their manufacturing and applications. Here, we report our discovery of a series of TBMGs in the (TiZrHf)(x)(CuNi)(y)(SnSi)(z) pseudo-ternary system. These alloys possess an exceptionally large d(c), reaching up to 12 mm, doubling the current record for Be and precious-metal free TBMGs. Moreover, these alloys exhibit a low density (7.0-7.3 g/cm(3)), high fracture-strength (up to similar to 2700 MPa), high specific fracture-strength (up to similar to 370 N m g(-1)), and even good plasticity with a plastic strain of up to 9.4% upon compression. They also possess high activation energy for crystallization and high atomic packing efficiency, which provide an initial physical account for their exceptional GFA and manufacturability.

DE Fairness; online meta learning; changing environment; adaption
AB The fairness-aware online learning framework has arisen as a powerful tool for the continual lifelong learning setting. The goal for the learner is to sequentially learn new tasks where they come one after another over time and the learner ensures the statistic parity of the new coming task across different protected sub-populations (e.g. race and gender). A major drawback of existing methods is that they make heavy use of the i.i.d assumption for data and hence provide static regret analysis for the framework. However, low static regret cannot imply a good performance in changing environments where tasks are sampled from heterogeneous distributions. To address the fairness-aware online learning problem in changing environments, in this paper we first construct a novel regret metric FairSAR by adding long-term fairness constraints onto a strongly adapted loss regret. Furthermore, to determine a good model parameter at each round, we propose a novel adaptive fairness-aware online meta-learning algorithm, namely FairSAOML, which is able to adapt to changing environments in both bias control and model precision. The problem is formulated in the form of a bi-level convex-concave optimization with respect to the model's primal and dual parameters that are associated with the model's accuracy and fairness, respectively. Theoretic analysis provides sub-linear upper bounds for both loss regret and violation of cumulative fairness constraints. Our experimental evaluation on different real-world datasets with settings of changing environments suggests that the proposed Fair-SAOML significantly outperforms alternatives based on the best prior online learning approaches.

AB Bursting bubbles transport bacteria, viruses, and other marine particles across the air-sea interface. This effect is enhanced when particles are hydrophobic and cling to the bubbles as they rise. Recent studies suggest that plastic particles, a major ocean pollutant, can also be transported by sea spray. However, estimates of plastic transport via this pathway have large uncertainties due to limited size detection techniques in field studies and few lab studies. An understanding of the number and size of particles carried in the smallest drops, which have the longest residence time in the atmosphere, is missing from current literature. Here, we develop a modeling framework to provide bounds on the number, area, and volume transport of non-scavenged hydrophilic and fully-scavenged hydrophobic particles of radii between 0.1 and 100 mu m for a range of jet and film drops. For droplets containing plastic particulates, we predict particle enrichment is significantly higher in jet drops than film drops. For particles in these jet drops, our results suggest that in the absence of bubble scavenging, the number distribution is dominated by smaller plastics, the mass/volume distribution by larger plastics, and surface area distribution is balanced across plastic size. Whereas for hydrophobic particles, scavenging dramatically modifies these distributions, enhancing certain particle-droplet size combinations by over four orders of magnitude. Our predictions suggest critical effects of enrichment in air-sea particle transport and highlight the variable dependencies on bubble and particle size, improving our theoretical understanding of plastic and marine particle transport and identifying modeling assumptions to refine with experimental measurements.
   Plastic particles in the oceans are a topic of growing concern due to their spread throughout the environment. The oceans are a reservoir of plastics, however recent studies have found that bursting bubbles can eject the plastic into the atmosphere, where it has the potential to be transported much further. We create a first-principles modeling framework to estimate the expected effects of particle and bubble size on the transport of hydrophobic and hydrophilic particles. We predict bounds on the extent that hydrophobic particles, like some plastics, may be highly selected to become airborne compared to hydrophilic particles. Selectivity effects are especially significant for the small airborne drops, which is important if it is the size of the drops rather than the size of the particle that influences the time they remain suspended in the atmosphere. This model provides a means to untangle the effects of bubble and particle size, as well as provide theoretical predictions to test against experimental data. This generic framework can be applied to the air-sea transport of particles beyond plastics, with important implications to the selective aerosolization of other particles such as viruses or bacteria.
   Modeling reveals how the air-sea transfer of hydrophilic/phobic particles between 0.1 and 100 mu m in radius varies with particle and bubble size Particle hydrophobicity may be key to air-sea transport as particles are selectively aerosolized up to 300,000x under the conditions modeled For drops containing plastic particulates, model predicts particle enrichment is significantly higher in jet drops than film drops

AB The current modus operandi in adapting pre-trained models involves updating all the backbone parameters, i.e., full fine-tuning. This paper introduces Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) as an efficient and effective alternative to full fine-tuning for large-scale Transformer models in vision. Taking inspiration from recent advances in efficiently tuning large language models, VPT introduces only a small amount (less than 1% of model parameters) of trainable parameters in the input space while keeping the model backbone frozen. Via extensive experiments on a wide variety of downstream recognition tasks, we show that VPT achieves significant performance gains compared to other parameter efficient tuning protocols. Most importantly, VPT even outperforms full fine-tuning in many cases across model capacities and training data scales, while reducing per-task storage cost. Code is available at github.com/kmnp/vpt.

AB Maintaining safe transportation infrastructure networks such as roadways benefit from image surveillance. One promising technology is 3D LiDAR scanning of which the paper presents the Slope LiDAR embankment (SLidE) dataset. This paper highlights 3D LiDAR exploitation methods for expansive clay terrains across different seasons at a specific site along the Terry Road Exit from I-20 westbound in Jackson, Mississippi. The analysis helps to understand the impact of seasonal moisture variation on slope stability, with a particular focus on the implications of climate change. Expansive clays, known for their shrink-swell behavior in response to moisture changes, pose significant geotechnical challenges, especially under the evolving conditions brought about by extreme weather. By capturing dynamic soil behavior through seasonal 3D scanning, the results provide insights into these soils' volumetric changes and deformation patterns at the monitored location, underscoring the critical influence of moisture dynamics on soil and slope stability. The proposed LiDAR 3D scan processing methodology is designed to reduce the computational load of analyzing large datasets. Moreover, this work shares the SLidE dataset. SLidE serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field, enhancing data processing efficiency and enabling real-time monitoring and rapid response to potential geotechnical failures. Results indicate a notable trend where the slope, subject to expansive clay dynamics, tends to revert to its normal structural state during the fall/winter months.

AB Topological data analysis (TDA) methods can be useful for classification and clustering tasks in many different fields as they can provide two dimensional persistence diagrams that summarize important information about the shape of potentially complex and high dimensional data sets. The space of persistence diagrams can be endowed with various metrics, which admit a statistical structure and allow to use these summaries for machine learning algorithms, e.g. the Wasserstein distance. However, computing the distance between two persistence diagrams involves finding an optimal way to match the points of the two diagrams and may not always be an easy task for classical computers. Recently, quantum algorithms have shown the potential to speedup the process of obtaining the persistence information displayed on persistence diagrams by estimating the spectra of persistent Dirac operators. So, in this work we explore the potential of quantum computers to estimate the distance between persistence diagrams as the next step in the design of a fully quantum framework for TDA. In particular we propose variational quantum algorithms for the Wasserstein distance as well as the dpc distance. Our implementation is a weighted version of the quantum approximate optimization Algorithm that relies on control clauses to encode the constraints of the optimization problem.

AB Potassium tantalate (KTaO3) single crystals annealed in hydrogen exhibit room-temperature persistent photoconductivity. The oxygen-poor annealing environment creates oxygen vacancies that are substituted with hydrogen. A photon of energy near the indirect bandgap (3.65 eV) can excite this defect, resulting in free electrons in the conduction band. This causes an increase in n- type conductivity of 4 orders of magnitude with a recovery time of 2-4 years. Hydrogen leaves the O site and forms an O-H bond that is observed by IR spectroscopy. The microscopic origin of the defect model is corroborated by hybrid density functional theory calculations.

AB Soft materials play an integral part in many aspects of modern life including autonomy, sustainability, and human health, and their accurate modeling is critical to understand their unique properties and functions. Today's finite element analysis packages come with a set of pre-programmed material models, which may exhibit restricted validity in capturing the intricate mechanical behavior of these materials. Regrettably, incorporating a modified or novel material model in a finite element analysis package requires non-trivial in-depth knowledge of tensor algebra, continuum mechanics, and computer programming, making it a complex task that is prone to human error. Here we design a universal material subroutine, which automates the integration of novel constitutive models of varying complexity in non-linear finite element packages, with no additional analytical derivations and algorithmic implementations. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach to seamlessly integrate innovative constitutive models from the material point to the structural level through a variety of soft matter case studies: a frontal impact to the brain; reconstructive surgery of the scalp; diastolic loading of arteries and the human heart; and the dynamic closing of the tricuspid valve. Our universal material subroutine empowers all users, not solely experts, to conduct reliable engineering analysis of soft matter systems. We envision that this framework will become an indispensable instrument for continued innovation and discovery within the soft matter community at large.

In the endocytic and secretory pathways, lumenal pH is controlled by isoforms and concentration of the vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (V-ATPase). In the endolysosomal pathway, copies of complete V-ATPase complexes accumulate as membranes mature from early endosomes to late endosomes and lysosomes. Thus, each compartment becomes more acidic as maturation proceeds. Lysosome acidification is essential for the breakdown of macromolecules delivered from endosomes as well as cargo from different autophagic pathways, and dysre-gulation of this process is linked to various diseases. Thus, it is important to understand the regulation of the V-ATPase. Here we describe a high-throughput method for screening inhibitors/activators of V-ATPase activity using Acridine Orange (AO) as a fluorescent reporter for acidified yeast vacuolar lysosomes. Through this method, the acidification of purified vacuoles can be measured in real-time in half-volume 96-well plates or a larger 384-well format. This not only reduces the cost of expensive low abundance reagents, but it drastically reduces the time needed to measure individual conditions in large volume cuvettes.

AB Despite significant investments in access network infrastructure, universal access to high-quality Internet connectivity remains a challenge. Policymakers often rely on large-scale, crowdsourced measurement datasets to assess the distribution of access network performance across geographic areas. These decisions typically rest on the assumption that Internet performance is uniformly distributed within predefined social boundaries, such as zip codes, census tracts, or neighborhood units. However, this assumption may not be valid for two reasons: (1) crowdsourced measurements often exhibit non-uniform sampling densities within geographic areas; and (2) predefined social boundaries may not align with the actual boundaries of Internet infrastructure. In this paper, we present a spatial analysis on crowdsourced datasets for constructing stable boundaries for sampling Internet performance. We hypothesize that greater stability in sampling boundaries will reflect the true nature of Internet performance disparities than misleading patterns observed as a result of data sampling variations. We apply and evaluate a series of statistical techniques to: (1) aggregate Internet performance over geographic regions; (2) overlay interpolated maps with various sampling unit choices; and (3) spatially cluster boundary units to identify contiguous areas with similar performance characteristics. We assess the effectiveness of the techniques we apply by comparing the similarity of the resulting boundaries for monthly samples drawn from the dataset. Our evaluation shows that the combination of techniques we apply achieves higher similarity compared to directly calculating central measures of network metrics over census tracts or neighborhood boundaries. These findings underscore the important role of spatial modeling in accurately assessing and optimizing the distribution of Internet performance, which can better inform policy, network operations, and long-term planning decisions.

AB Chalcogenide perovskites, especially BaZrS3 and its related alloys, present a promising alternative to lead halide perovskites for optoelectronic applications due to their reduced toxicity and enhanced stability. However, the elevated temperature conditions necessary for preparing these materials create a barrier to their incorporation into thin-film devices. In this work, we report a solution-phase synthesis of colloidal nanoparticles of titanium-alloyed BaZrS3, Ba(Zr1-xTix)S-3. The titanium alloying was achieved using reactive amide precursors in oleylamine solvent, and N,N '-diethylthiourea served as the sulfur source. Our methodology allowed for the synthesis of Ba(Zr1-xTix)S-3 nanomaterials at temperatures at or below 300 degrees C. The resulting nanocrystals exhibited a phase transition from an orthorhombic distorted perovskite structure to a hexagonal non-perovskite phase as the titanium content surpassed x = 0.11, accompanied by a morphological evolution from nanoplatelets to nanohexagons and ultimately nanobars. The UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectra of Ba(Zr1-xTix)S-3 nanoparticles exhibit increasing low-energy absorption as the titanium content is increased. This work contributes to the development of low-temperature synthesis methods for Ba(Zr1-xTix)S-3 nanomaterials, offering new potential pathways for materials design of chalcogenide perovskites for advanced optoelectronic applications.

TI Enhanced magnetoelectric coupling in two-dimensional hybrid multiferroic
   heterostructures
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
LA English
DT Article
ID SYMMETRY
AB Magnetoelectric coupling in insulating multiferroic materials is invaluable for both fundamental research and multifunctional device applications. However, material realization remains a significant challenge. We employ first-principles calculations to predict an enhanced and stacking-robust magnetoelectric coupling in a multiferroic van der Waals heterostructure consisting of CrCl3 and CuCrP2S6. Within this heterostructure, the intralayer ferroic orders exhibit characteristics of a type-I multiferroic, while the interlayer ferroic orders resemble those of a type-II multiferroic, thus creating a hybrid-type multiferroic. Notably, the interlayer magnetic configuration can be switched upon electric-polarization reversal, while maintaining the insulating property without any nontrivial phase transitions. Our analysis reveals a strongly interfacial spin local-field effect and proximity polarization effect on band alignments. These factors work synergistically to decide the interlayer exchange interaction and drive enhanced magnetoelectric coupling. Finally, we show that this magnetoelectric effect is robust in multilayer structures, exhibiting a dependence on the layer number's parity. This research offers promising prospects for discovering enhanced magnetoelectric couplings in hybrid multiferroic van der Waals heterostructures.

ID CAVITATION
AB Muddy marine sediments are elastic materials in which bubbles grow and worms extend their burrows by fracture. Bubble growth and burrowing behavior are dependent on the stiffness and fracture toughness (KIc) of these muds. This article describes a custom laboratory apparatus to measure the fracture toughness of muddy, cohesive sediments using a bubble injection method. The system induces fracture in sediment samples by incrementally injecting air through a needle inserted into the sediment. The increasing pneumatic pressure is monitored until it drops abruptly, indicating bubble formation. Fracture toughness is then calculated from the peak pressure at which fracture occurred, following cavitation rheology methods developed for soft gels. The system has produced measurements that compare well to previous data but with better spatial resolution, allowing for characterization of spatial heterogeneity on small scales.

AB Flexible thermal insulating membranes are ubiquitous in thermal management. Nevertheless, difficulties arise for composite membranes to combine a resilient, robust structural framework with uniform percolation networks purposefully conceived for thermal insulation. Herein, by controlling the microstructure homogeneity, we report flexible, hydrophobic thermal insulating membranes consisting of ceramic fiber and porous silica materials. The resulting nanofibrous membrane composites exhibit a low thermal insulation of 11.4 mW m(-1) K-1, a low density of 0.245 g cm(-3), mechanical flexibility with a bending rigidity of 1.25 cN mm(-1), and hydrophobicity with a water contact angle of 144 degrees. These nanofibrous-reinforced, silica-aerogel-based nanocomposite membranes are potential candidates for advanced thermal management applications.

AB This study examines nanoparticle diffusion in crowded polymer nanocomposites by diffusing small Al2O3 nanoparticles (NPs) in SiO2-loaded P2VP matrices. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS) measures Al2O3 NP diffusion coefficients within a homogeneous PNC background of larger, immobile SiO2 NPs. By developing a geometric model for the average interparticle distance in a system with two NP sizes, we quantify nanocomposite confinement relative to the Al2O3 NP size with a bound layer. At low SiO2 concentrations, Al2O3 NP diffusion aligns with the neat polymer results. In more crowded nanocomposites with higher SiO2 concentrations where the interparticle distance approaches the size of the mobile Al2O3 NP, the 6.5 nm Al2O3 NPs diffuse faster than predicted by both core-shell and vehicular diffusion models. Relative to our previous studies of NPs diffusing into polymers, these findings demonstrate that the local environment in crowded systems significantly complicates NP diffusion behavior and the bound layer lifetimes.

AB Large Computer-Aided Design (CAD) projects usually require collaboration across many different CAD systems as well as applications that interoperate with them for manufacturing, visualization, or simulation. A fundamental barrier to such collaborations is the ability to refer to parts of the geometry (such as a specific face) robustly under geometric and/or topological changes to the model. Persistent referencing schemes are a fundamental aspect of most CAD tools, but models that are shared across systems cannot generally make use of these internal referencing mechanisms, creating a challenge for collaboration. In this work, we address this issue by developing a novel learning-based algorithm that can automatically find correspondences between two CAD models using the standard representation used for sharing models across CAD systems: the Boundary-Representation (B-rep). Because our method works directly on B-reps it can be generalized across different CAD applications enabling collaboration.

AB AWS DeepRacer is a fully autonomous 1/18th scale race car designed to help developers learn and practice reinforcement learning through cloud-based simulations and real-world racing. What drives the reinforcement learning model is the reward function, a way to provide positive or negative feedback to an agent, guiding its learning process in reinforcement learning by assigning numerical values. In the AWS training environment, there are multiple modes in which you can run training simulations and evaluations in. These modes include Time Trial, Object Avoidance, and a relatively new mode: Head to Bot. The research done in this project was primarily focused on testing reward functions in the Head to Bot mode as well as developing a research function that would be suited for training in this new Head to Bot mode. The developed algorithm outperformed the default Centerline reward function, as well as the Object Avoidance reward function.

AB Silent speech interfaces offer an alternative and efficient communication modality for individuals with voice disorders and when the vocalized speech communication is compromised by noisy environments. Despite the recent progress in developing silent speech interfaces, these systems face several challenges that prevent their wide acceptance, such as bulkiness, obtrusiveness, and immobility. Herein, the material optimization, structural design, deep learning algorithm, and system integration of mechanically and visually unobtrusive silent speech interfaces are presented that can realize both speaker identification and speech content identification. Conformal, transparent, and self-adhesive electromyography electrode arrays are designed for capturing speech-relevant muscle activities. Temporal convolutional networks are employed for recognizing speakers and converting sensing signals into spoken content. The resulting silent speech interfaces achieve a 97.5% speaker classification accuracy and 91.5% keyword classification accuracy using four electrodes. The speech interface is further integrated with an optical hand-tracking system and a robotic manipulator for human-robot collaboration in both assembly and disassembly processes. The integrated system achieves the control of the robot manipulator by silent speech and facilitates the hand-over process by hand motion trajectory detection. The developed framework enables natural robot control in noisy environments and lays the ground for collaborative human-robot tasks involving multiple human operators.

AB Infections caused by Mycobacterium spp. are very challenging to treat, and multidrug-resistant strains rapidly spread in human populations. Major contributing factors include the unique physiological features of these bacteria, drug efflux, and the low permeability barrier of their outer membrane. Here, we focus on MmpL3 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, an essential inner membrane transporter of the resistance-nodulation-division superfamily required for the translocation of mycolic acids in the form of trehalose monomycolates (TMM) from the cytoplasm or plasma membrane to the periplasm or outer membrane. The MmpL3-dependent transport of TMM is essential for the growth of M. tuberculosis in vitro, inside macrophages, and in M. tuberculosis-infected mice. MmpL3 is also a validated target for several recently identified anti-mycobacterial agents. In this study, we reconstituted the lipid transport activity of the purified MmpL3 using a two-lipid vesicle system and established the ability of MmpL3 to actively extract phospholipids from the outer leaflet of a lipid bilayer. In contrast, we found that MmpL3 lacks the ability to translocate the same phospholipid substrate across the plasma membrane indicating that it is not an energy-dependent flippase. The lipid extraction activity was modulated by substitutions in critical charged and polar residues of the periplasmic substrate-binding pocket of MmpL3, coupled to the proton transfer activity of MmpL3 and inhibited by a small molecule inhibitor SQ109. Based on the results, we propose a mechanism of allosteric coupling wherein substrate translocation by MmpL3 is coupled to the energy provided by the downhill transfer of protons. The reconstituted activities will facilitate understanding the mechanism of MmpL3-dependent transport of lipids and the discovery of new therapeutic options for Mycobacterium spp. infections.

AB Particle deposition dynamics in a fully developed turbulent channel flow at a friction Reynolds number of Re-tau = 180 for two Stokes numbers (St = 1 and 10) are investigated using the point particle-direct numerical simulation (PP-DNS) method, considering dilute system and thus, one-way coupling. In particular, the interplay between particle size, particle property (density) and deposition at the same Stokes number has been investigated. It turns out that the dimensionless particle relaxation time (the Stokes number) alone does not provide enough information to capture the deposition dynamics, and particle size (diameter) and density need to be considered to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of deposition process. Furthermore, we demonstrate that gravity significantly alter the deposition patterns of particles with different size and density differently, even if the Stokes number does not change, and therefore the results from zero gravity cannot be extrapolated to non -zero gravity settings, even for small particles. Finally, our results suggest that wall -normal particle velocity variance at the wall plays an integral role in the deposition process, as it approaches a finite value (significantly larger than particle mean velocity) at the wall.

AB Supervised machine learning approaches have been increasingly used in accelerating electronic structure prediction as surrogates of first-principle computational methods, such as density functional theory (DFT). While numerous quantum chemistry datasets focus on chemical properties and atomic forces, the ability to achieve accurate and efficient prediction of the Hamiltonian matrix is highly desired, as it is the most important and fundamental physical quantity that determines the quantum states of physical systems and chemical properties. In this work, we generate a new Quantum Hamiltonian dataset, named as QH9, to provide precise Hamiltonian matrices for 999 molecular dynamics trajectories and 130,831 stable molecular geometries, based on the QM9 dataset. By designing benchmark tasks with various molecules, we show that current machine learning models have the capacity to predict Hamiltonian matrices for arbitrary molecules. Both the QH9 dataset and the baseline models are provided to the community through an open-source benchmark, which can be highly valuable for developing machine learning methods and accelerating molecular and materials design for scientific and technological applications. Our benchmark is publicly available at https://github.com/divelab/AIRS/tree/main/OpenDFT/QHBench.

ID FABRICATION; MOVEMENTS
AB Soft actuators hold great promise for applications in biomimetic robots, artificial muscles, and drug delivery systems due to their adaptability in diverse environments. A critical aspect of designing thermally responsive soft actuators is to achieve spatially programmable actuation under a global thermal stimulus. Different local actuation behaviors can be encoded in one actuator to enable complex morphing structures for different tasks. However, it is challenging to achieve programmability beyond one or binary states. This work introduces a new grayscale ultraviolet (UV) light processing method to fabricate soft actuators with spatially tunable Young's modulus, enabling multiple programmable states in one actuator. Together with a liquid crystal elastomer actuation layer and a photothermal heating layer, the LCE programming layer with spatially programmable moduli allows different regions of the soft actuator to bend to controllable extents under a global thermal stimulus. Various shape morphing patterns can be encoded using UV photomasks with spatially controlled grayscales. Additionally, caterpillar-inspired robots capable of bi-directional crawling and octopus-arm-inspired structures for object manipulation are demonstrated. This work represents advancements in the programmability of thermally responsive soft actuators, laying the foundation for their applications in advanced soft robotic systems.

DT Article
ID HIGHER SYMMETRIES; STABILITY
AB We propose that the Fermi surface anomaly of symmetry group G in any dimension is universally classified by G -symmetric interacting fermionic symmetry -protected topological (SPT) phases in (0 + 1) -dimensional spacetime. The argument is based on the perspective that the gapless fermions on the Fermi surface can be viewed as the topological boundary modes of Chern insulators in the phase space (position -momentum space). Given the noncommutative nature of the phase -space coordinates, we show that the momentum space dimensions should be counted as negative dimensions for SPT classification purposes. Therefore, the classification of phase -space Chern insulators (or, more generally fermionic SPT phases) always reduces to a (0 + 1) -dimensional problem, which can then be answered by the cobordism approach. In addition to the codimension-1 Fermi surface case, we also discuss the codimension-p Fermi surface case briefly. We provide concrete examples to demonstrate the validity of our classification scheme, and make connections to the recent development of Fermi surface symmetric mass generation.

AB Cookies play a vital role in our Internet browsing experience, enabling various functions on websites. However, their significance also extends to potential vulnerabilities, especially in the face of cyber-attacks like cross-site scripting. As we interact with websites daily, it remains uncertain how well these platforms protect user data from such attacks or how efficiently they address vulnerabilities. To address these concerns, our research endeavors to conduct a comprehensive measurement study across the entire Internet landscape. Our goal is to shed light on the potential security risks and the extent to which protective measures are deployed on websites. We developed a customized toolkit to scrape a multitude of websites on the Internet, this objective can be assessed by analyzing the security flags of cookies. Through this study on web cookies, we obtained a better understanding of the current state of web security and identified potential areas of improvement.

DE Federated Learning; Data Heterogeneity
AB Dealing with data heterogeneity is a key challenge in the theoretical analysis of federated learning (FL) algorithms. In the literature, gradient divergence is often used as the sole metric for data heterogeneity. However, we observe that the gradient divergence cannot fully characterize the impact of the data heterogeneity in Federated Averaging (FedAvg) even for the quadratic objective functions. This limitation leads to an overestimate of the communication complexity. Motivated by this observation, we propose a new analysis framework based on the difference between the minima of the global objective function and the minima of the local objective functions. Using the new framework, we derive a tighter convergence upper bound for heterogeneous quadratic objective functions. The theoretical results reveal new insights into the impact of the data heterogeneity on the convergence of FedAvg and provide a deeper understanding of the two-stage learning rates. Experimental results using non-IID data partitions validate the theoretical findings.

AB Disulfide-containing polyolefins were synthesized by ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of the 6-membered disulfide-containing cyclic olefin, 3,6-dihydro-1,2-dithiine, which was prepared by ring-closing metathesis of diallyl disulfide. This approach facilitated the production of disulfide-containing unsaturated polyolefins as copolymers with disulfide monomer units embedded within a poly(cyclooctene) or poly(norbornene) framework. The incorporation of disulfides into the polymer backbone imparts redox responsiveness and enables polymer degradation via chemical reduction or thiol-disulfide exchange. This ROMP copolymerization strategy yielded both linear polyolefins, as well as bottlebrush polymers, with degradable segments, thereby broadening the scope of responsive polymer architectures synthesized by ROMP.

TI Machine learning to identify structural motifs in asphaltenes
SO RESULTS IN CHEMISTRY

   Deep learning
AB Asphaltenes are organic compounds that aggregate in crude oil with two dominant molecular architectures: archipelago and continental. Continental architectures possess a single uniform island structure composed of aromatic rings in contrast to archipelago architectures with aromatic cores interconnected through aliphatic chains. The structural composition of asphaltenes varies globally due to geographical differences, posing challenges in their classification due to a lack of uniformity. This study is the first known exploration of using imagebased supervised machine learning, particularly the ResNet-50 neural network, for the binary classification of asphaltenes into continental and archipelago motifs. 255 continental and archipelago models underwent structural augmentations to create a sample size of 1,530 asphaltene structures that is robust enough for accurate results in both the training and testing portions of the machine learning. These augmentations included the repeated addition of carbons until a complete pentane chain was added to a specified carbon on each asphaltene structure. Using Mathematica, supervised ResNet-50 image-based classification was used on both original and augmented structure datasets to classify as either archipelago or continental. The classification was also implemented using topological similarity searching for association between atoms and the distance between them for further molecule identification. This study demonstrates the surprising effectiveness of image-based classification compared to traditional topological feature-based methods. Our results reveal that deep learning techniques, especially image-based approaches, provide novel and insightful ways to differentiate complex molecular structures like asphaltenes, challenging the traditional reliance on topological features alone. This research opens new avenues in chemical analysis and molecular characterization, highlighting the potential of machine learning in complex molecular systems.

AB The strategy of pre-training a large model on a diverse dataset, then fine-tuning for a particular application has yielded impressive results in computer vision, natural language processing, and robotic control. This strategy has vast potential in adaptive control, where it is necessary to rapidly adapt to changing conditions with limited data. Toward concretely understanding the benefit of pre-training for adaptive control, we study the adaptive linear quadratic control problem in the setting where the learner has prior knowledge of a collection of basis matrices for the dynamics. This basis is misspecified in the sense that it cannot perfectly represent the dynamics of the underlying data generating process. We propose an algorithm that uses this prior knowledge, and prove upper bounds on the expected regret after T interactions with the system. In the regime where T is small, the upper bounds are dominated by a term that scales with either poly(log T) or root T, depending on the prior knowledge available to the learner. When T is large, the regret is dominated by a term that grows with delta T, where delta quantifies the level of misspecification. This linear term arises due to the inability to perfectly estimate the underlying dynamics using the misspecified basis, and is therefore unavoidable unless the basis matrices are also adapted online. However, it only dominates for large T, after the sublinear terms arising due to the error in estimating the weights for the basis matrices become negligible. We provide simulations that validate our analysis. Our simulations also show that offline data from a collection of related systems can be used as part of a pre-training stage to estimate a misspecified dynamics basis, which is in turn used by our adaptive controller.

AB The first months of the COVID-19 crisis offer the possibility to observe patterns of innovation in response to a large, unanticipated shock, simultaneously creating severe adversity and new opportunities. Using new survey data on 22,102 small businesses, we study the amounts, types, and determinants of innovation, particularly firm age, size, factor adjustment, and prior capabilities. Results imply high rates of innovation during the pandemic, including new products, processes, and modes of delivery. Regressions show that rates are higher for younger and larger firms, where younger firms show a greater propensity for product innovations and larger firms for process innovations. Innovation is higher for firms that adjust factors (employment) less. Firms with either extensive or zero pre-pandemic capabilities to accommodate social distancing innovated the least in directions that would expand this capability, while firms with some prior capability innovated the most to expand upon process innovations related to social distancing. Young firms are more likely to increase E-sales, while large firms are more likely to adjust the share of teleworkers.

AB Anionic dopants, such as O-atom vacancies, alter the thermochemical and kinetic parameters of proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) at metal oxide surfaces; understanding their impact(s) is essential for informed material design for efficient energy conversion processes. To circumvent challenges associated with studying extended solids, we employ polyoxovanadate-alkoxide clusters as atomically precise models of reducible metal oxide surfaces. In this work, we examine net hydrogen atom (H-atom) uptake to an oxygen deficient vanadium oxide assembly, [V6O6(MeCN)(OCH3)(12)](0). Addition of two H-atom equivalents to [V6O6(MeCN)(OCH3)(12)](0) results in formation of [V6O5(MeCN)(OH2)(OCH3)(12)](0). Assessment of the bond dissociation free energy of the O-H bonds of the resultant aquo moiety reveals that the presence of an O-atom defect weakens the O-H bond strength. Despite a decreased thermodynamic driving force for the reduction of [V6O6(MeCN)(OCH3)(12)](0), kinetic investigations show the rate of H-atom uptake at the cluster surface is similar to 100x faster than its oxidized congener, [V6O7(OCH3)(12)](0). Electron density derived from the O-atom vacancy is shown to play an important role in influencing H-atom uptake at the cluster surface, lowering activation barriers for H-atom transfer.

AB Elasticity is one important feature in modern cloud computing systems and can result in computation failure or significantly increase computing time. Such elasticity means that virtual machines over the cloud can be preempted under a short notice (e.g., hours or minutes) if a high-priority job appears; on the other hand, new virtual machines may become available over time to compensate the computing resources. Coded Storage Elastic Computing (CSEC) introduced by Yang et al. in 2018 is an effective and efficient approach to overcome the elasticity and it costs relatively less storage and computation load. However, one of the limitations of the CSEC is that it may only be applied to certain types of computations (e.g., linear) and may be challenging to be applied to more involved computations because the coded data storage and approximation are often needed. Hence, it may be preferred to use uncoded storage by directly copying data into the virtual machines. In addition, based on our own measurement, virtual machines on Amazon EC2 clusters often have heterogeneous computation speed even if they have exactly the same configurations (e.g., CPU, RAM, I/O cost). In this paper, we introduce a new optimization framework on Uncoded Storage Elastic Computing (USEC) systems with heterogeneous computing speed to minimize the overall computation time. Under this framework, we propose optimal solutions of USEC systems with or without straggler tolerance using different storage placements. Our proposed algorithms are evaluated using power iteration applications on Amazon EC2.

AB Most of existing work on fairness assumes available demographic information in the training set. In practice, due to legal or privacy concerns, when demographic information is not available in the training set, it is crucial to find alternative objectives to ensure fairness. Existing work on fairness without demographics follows Rawlsian Max-Min fairness objectives. However, such constraints could be too strict to improve group fairness, and could lead to a great decrease in accuracy. In light of these limitations, in this paper, we propose to solve the problem from a new perspective, i.e., through knowledge distillation. Our method uses soft label from an overfitted teacher model as an alternative, and we show from preliminary experiments that soft labelling is beneficial for improving fairness. We analyze theoretically the fairness of our method, and we show that our method can be treated as an error-based reweighing. Experimental results on three datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives, with notable improvements in group fairness and with relatively small decrease in accuracy.

AB Spurious correlations arise when irrelevant patterns in input data are mistakenly associated with labels, compromising the generalizability of machine learning models. While these models may be confident during the training stage, they often falter in real-world testing scenarios due to the shift of these misleading correlations. Current solutions to this problem typically involve altering the correlations or regularizing latent representations. However, while these methods show promise in experiments, a rigorous theoretical understanding of their effectiveness and the underlying factors of spurious correlations is lacking. In this work, we provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis, supported by empirical evidence, to understand the intricacies of spurious correlations. Drawing on our proposed theorems, we investigate the behaviors of classifiers when confronted with spurious features, and present our findings on how various factors influence these correlations and their impact on model performances, including the Mahalanobis distance of groups, and training/testing spurious correlation ratios. Additionally, by aligning empirical outcomes with our theoretical discoveries, we highlight the feasibility of assessing the degree of separability of intertwined real-world features. This research paves the way for a nuanced comprehension of spurious correlations, laying a solid theoretical groundwork that promises to steer future endeavors toward crafting more potent mitigation techniques.

AB Secure aggregation, which is a core component of federated learning, aggregates locally trained models from distributed users at a central server, without revealing any other information about the local users' data. This paper follows a recent information theoretic secure aggregation problem with user dropouts, where the objective is to characterize the minimum communication cost from the K users to the server during the model aggregation. All existing secure aggregation protocols let the users share and store coded keys to guarantee security. On the motivation that uncoded groupwise keys are more convenient to be shared and could be used in large range of practical applications, this paper is the first to consider uncoded groupwise keys, where the keys are mutually independent and each key is shared by a group of S users. We show that if S is beyond a threshold, a new secure aggregation protocol with uncoded groupwise keys, referred to as GroupSecAgg, can achieve the same optimal communication cost as the best protocol with coded keys. The experiments on Amazon EC2 show the considerable improvements on the key sharing and model aggregation times compared to the state-of-the art.

AB Camelina ( Camelina sativa), an allohexaploid species, is an emerging aviation biofuel crop that has been the focus of resurgent interest in recent decades. To guide future breeding and crop improvement efforts, the community requires a deeper comprehension of subgenome dominance, often noted in allopolyploid species, "alongside an understanding of the genetic diversity" and population structure of material present within breeding programs. We conducted population genetic analyses of a C. sativa diversity panel, leveraging a new genome, to estimate nucleotide diversity and population structure, and analyzed for patterns of subgenome expression dominance among different organs. Our analyses confirm that C. sativa has relatively low genetic diversity and show that the SG3 subgenome has substantially lower genetic diversity compared to the other two subgenomes. Despite the low genetic diversity, our analyses identified 13 distinct subpopulations including two distinct wild populations and others putatively representing founders in existing breeding populations. When analyzing for subgenome composition of long non-coding RNAs, which are known to play important roles in (a)biotic stress tolerance, we found that the SG3 subgenome contained significantly more lincRNAs compared to other subgenomes. Similarly, transcriptome analyses revealed that expression dominance of SG3 is not as strong as previously reported and may not be universal across all organ types. From a global analysis, SG3 "was only significant higher expressed" in flower, flower bud, and fruit organs, which is an important discovery given that the crop yield is associated with these organs. Collectively, these results will be valuable for guiding future breeding efforts in camelina.

AB We use 23 yr of astrometric and radial velocity data on the orbit of the star S0-2 to constrain a hypothetical intermediate-mass black hole orbiting the massive black hole Sgr A* at the Galactic center. The data place upper limits on variations of the orientation of the stellar orbit at levels between 002 and 007 per year. We use a combination of analytic estimates and full numerical integrations of the orbit of S0-2 in the presence of a black hole binary. For a companion intermediate-mass black hole outside the orbit of S0-2 (1020 au), we find that a companion black hole with mass m(c) between 10(3) and 10(5)M(circle dot) is excluded, with a boundary behaving as a(c)similar to m(c)(1/3). For a companion with a(c) < 1020 au, a black hole with mass between 10(3) and 10(5)M(circle dot) is excluded, with a(c)similar to m(c)(-1/2). These bounds arise from quadrupolar perturbations of the orbit of S0-2. Significantly stronger bounds on an inner companion arise from the fact that the location of S0-2 is measured relative to the bright emission of Sgr A* and that separation is perturbed by the "wobble" of Sgr A* about the center of mass between it and the companion. The result is a set of bounds as small as 400 M-circle dot at 200 au; the numerical simulations suggest a bound from these effects varying as a(c)similar to m(c)(-1). We compare and contrast our results with those from a recent analysis by the GRAVITY collaboration.

AB Contrastive learning is a self-supervised representation learning method that achieves milestone performance in various classification tasks. However, due to its unsupervised fashion, it suffers from the false negative sample problem: randomly drawn negative samples that are assumed to have a different label but actually have the same label as the anchor. This deteriorates the performance of contrastive learning as it contradicts the motivation of contrasting semantically similar and dissimilar pairs. This raised the attention and the importance of finding legitimate negative samples, which should be addressed by distinguishing between 1) true vs. false negatives; 2) easy vs. hard negatives. However, previous works were limited to the statistical approach to handle false negative and hard negative samples with hyperparameters tuning. In this paper, we go beyond the statistical approach and explore the connection between hard negative samples and data bias. We introduce a novel debiased contrastive learning method to explore hard negatives by relative difficulty referencing the bias amplifying counterpart. We propose triplet loss for training a biased encoder that focuses more on easy negative samples. We theoretically show that the triplet loss amplifies the bias in self-supervised representation learning. Finally, we empirically show the proposed method improves downstream classification performance.

AB Fairness has become an important topic in machine learning. Generally, most literature on fairness assumes that the sensitive information, such as gender or race, is present in the training set, and uses this information to mitigate bias. However, due to practical concerns like privacy and regulation, applications of these methods are restricted. Also, although much of the literature studies supervised learning, in many real-world scenarios, we want to utilize the large unlabelled dataset to improve the model's accuracy. Can we improve fair classification without sensitive information and without labels? To tackle the problem, in this paper, we propose a novel reweighing-based contrastive learning method. The goal of our method is to learn a generally fair representation without observing sensitive attributes. Our method assigns weights to training samples per iteration based on their gradient directions relative to the validation samples such that the average top-k validation loss is minimized. Compared with past fairness methods without demographics, our method is built on fully unsupervised training data and requires only a small labelled validation set. We provide rigorous theoretical proof of the convergence of our model. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves better or comparable performance than state-of-the-art methods on three datasets in terms of accuracy and several fairness metrics.

AB There is a resurgent enthusiasm for Indigenous Knowledges (IK) across settler-colonial institutions of research, education, and conservation. But like fitting a square peg in a round hole, IK are being forced into colonial systems, and then only as marginal alternatives. To address this mismatch, the Traditional Ecological Knowledge Section of the Ecological Society of America (ESA) hosted a 2-day workshop-entitled Elevating Indigenous Knowledges in Ecology-at the 2022 ESA Annual Meeting, which was held on Kanien'keh & aacute;ka (Mohawk) and Ho-de-no-sau-nee-ga (Haudenosaunee) territories in Montreal, Canada. This gathering of 21 interdisciplinary Indigenous ecologists included scholars from across the career and professional spectrum. By consensus, workshop participants (including the authors of this article) identified four emergent themes and respective guiding questions as a pathway toward the transformation of settler-colonial institutions into IK-led spaces. We highlight this pathway to support actions toward systemic change, inspire future directions for Indigenous and non-Indigenous ecologists, and nurture stronger relationships between Indigenous communities and the Western sciences, toward actualized decoloniality.

AB Polar topological phases in oxide superlattices attracted significant attention due to their unique properties. Previous work revealed that a polar vortex and polar skyrmions exist in (PTO)/(STO) superlattices under different elastic constraints, i.e., on different substrates. Here, our phase-field simulation demonstrates that manipulating the PTO and STO layers' thickness can control the effective screening provided by STO and the depolarization degree in PTO, thus switching the system among the polar skyrmions, vortex labyrinth, or paraelectric phase without changing elastic constraints. Additionally, reducing the STO thickness creates interlayer coupling among PTO layers, generating the long-range order of topological phases within superlattices. Furthermore, we construct a PTO-STO thickness topological phase diagram. These findings offer insights into the polar topological phases' formation in oxide superlattices, elucidating the roles of ferroelectric and paraelectric layers in their formation.

AB Urban mobility is a critical contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for over 30% of urban carbon emissions in the United States in 2021. Addressing this challenge requires a comprehensive and data-driven approach to transform transportation systems into sustainable networks. This paper presents an integrated framework that leverages artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and life cycle assessment (LCA) to analyze, model, and optimize urban mobility. The framework consists of four key components: AI-powered analysis and models, synthetic urban mobility data generation, LCA for environmental footprint analysis, and data-driven policy interventions. By combining these elements, the framework not only deciphers complex mobility patterns but also quantifies their environmental impacts, providing actionable insights for policy decisions aimed at reducing carbon emissions and promoting sustainable urban transportation. The implications of this approach extend beyond individual cities, offering a blueprint for global sustainable urban mobility.

TI Observatory: Characterizing Embeddings of Relational Tables
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE VLDB ENDOWMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID REPRESENTATION; SEARCH
AB Language models and specialized table embedding models have recently demonstrated strong performance on many tasks over tabular data. Researchers and practitioners are keen to leverage these models in many new application contexts; but limited understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of these models, and the table representations they generate, makes the process of finding a suitable model for a given task reliant on trial and error. There is an urgent need to gain a comprehensive understanding of these models to minimize inefficiency and failures in downstream usage.
   To address this need, we propose Observatory, a formal framework to systematically analyze embedding representations of relational tables. Motivated both by invariants of the relational data model and by statistical considerations regarding data distributions, we define eight primitive properties, and corresponding measures to quantitatively characterize table embeddings for these properties. Based on these properties, we define an extensible framework to evaluate language and table embedding models. We collect and synthesize a suite of datasets and use Observatory to analyze nine such models. Our analysis provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses of learned representations over tables. We find, for example, that some models are sensitive to table structure such as column order, that functional dependencies are rarely reflected in embeddings, and that specialized table embedding models have relatively lower sample fidelity. Such insights help researchers and practitioners better anticipate model behaviors and select appropriate models for their downstream tasks, while guiding researchers in the development of new models.

ID LEAKAGE CURRENT; BREAKDOWN; KV; RECOMBINATION; DEGRADATION
AB Ultra-wide bandgap (UWBG) NiO/beta-Ga2O3 p-n junction has recently emerged as a key building block for emerging electronic and optoelectronic devices. However, the long-term reliability of this bipolar junction remains elusive. Here, the temporal evolution of the transient parametric shift is characterized in this junction under the prolonged forward- and reverse-bias stresses as well as in the post-stress recoveries. The temperature-dependent evolutions reveal the energy level and time constant of the dominant trap. The forward-bias stress is found to induce a negative turn-on voltage (V-ON) shift, the magnitude of which correlates with the stressed current density, while the reverse-bias stress leads to the opposite effect. Such V-ON shift is induced by an electron trap with an activation energy of 0.46 eV, which may originate from native point defects in beta-Ga2O3 near the junction interface. Under a high forward current stress of 1000 A/cm(2), device failure is found to be located at the edge region with the thinnest NiO, which is likely to be caused by the injection of hot electrons that diffuse across the entire NiO layer. Overall, the magnitude of parametric shift is approaching or comparable to those reported in the native SiC and GaN p-n junctions, suggesting that the NiO/beta-Ga2O3-based UWBG devices have good potential to achieve a reliability comparable to their WBG counterparts.

AB Herein, we report the palladium-catalyzed borylation of aryl halides (iodides or bromides) under base-free conditions utilizing a commercially available Lewis acidic mediator, Zn(OTf)2. Under these conditions, an array of electronically and functional-group-diverse aryl iodides and bromides undergo borylation to afford the corresponding aryl boronic esters in <= 82% isolated yields. Mechanistic investigations are consistent with Zn(OTf)2 enabling transmetalation between a cationic Pd(II)-Ar intermediate and B2pin2 via halide abstraction. Furthermore, stabilization of the cationic [ArPdII]+ complex with added [BArF 4]- significantly improves the reaction efficiency with electron-poor arenes.

AB To fluidly engage with the world, our brains must simultaneously represent both the scene in front of us and our memory of the immediate surrounding environment (i.e., local visuospatial context). How does the brain's functional architecture enable sensory and mnemonic representations to closely interface while also avoiding sensory-mnemonic interference? Here, we asked this question using first-person, head-mounted virtual reality and fMRI. Using virtual reality, human participants of both sexes learned a set of immersive, real-world visuospatial environments in which we systematically manipulated the extent of visuospatial context associated with a scene image in memory across three learning conditions, spanning from a sin-gle FOV to a city street. We used individualized, within-subject fMRI to determine which brain areas support memory of the visuospatial context associated with a scene during recall (Experiment 1) and recognition (Experiment 2). Across the whole brain, activity in three patches of cortex was modulated by the amount of known visuospatial context, each located immedi-ately anterior to one of the three scene perception areas of high-level visual cortex. Individual subject analyses revealed that these anterior patches corresponded to three functionally defined place memory areas, which selectively respond when visu-ally recalling personally familiar places. In addition to showing activity levels that were modulated by the amount of visuo-spatial context, multivariate analyses showed that these anterior areas represented the identity of the specific environment being recalled. Together, these results suggest a convergence zone for scene perception and memory of the local visuospatial context at the anterior edge of high-level visual cortex.

AB Polymer-networked nanoparticles are the basis for advanced materials useful for wearable electronics, drug delivery, autonomous computing, and other applications. To characterize and predict the physics and underlying mechanisms of the network connections in two-and three-dimensional engineered nanoparticle arrays, we developed an analogous Potts model of three-state sites. Together with dissipative particle dynamics simulations, we found that the network structures in polymer-linked nanoparticle assemblies are generally dominated by the number of nearest neighbors and not the topology of the lattice. When the E field regulates the network connections, the links along the E-field direction always dominate the overall network structure.

AB Symmetric mass generation (SMG) is a mechanism to give gapless fermions a mass gap by nonperturbative interactions without generating any fermion bilinear condensation. The previous studies of SMG have been limited to Dirac/Weyl/Majorana fermions with zero Fermi volume in the free fermion limit. In this paper, we generalize the concept of SMG to Fermi liquid (FL) with a finite Fermi volume and discuss how to gap out the Fermi surfaces (FSs) by interactions without breaking the U(1) loop group symmetry or developing topological orders. We provide examples of FS SMG in both (1+1)-dimensional [(1+1)D] and (2+1)-dimensional FL systems when several FSs together cancel the FS anomaly. However, the U(1) loop group symmetry in these cases is still restrictive enough to rule out all possible fermion bilinear gapping terms, such that a nonperturbative interaction mechanism is the only way to gap out the FSs. This symmetric FS reconstruction is in contrast to the conventional symmetry-breaking gapping mechanism in the FL. As a side product, our model provides a pristine one-dimensional lattice regularization for the (1+1)D U(1) symmetric chiral fermion model (e.g., the 3-4-5-0 model) by utilizing a lattice translation symmetry as an emergent U(1) symmetry at low energy. This opens up the opportunity for efficient numerical simulations of chiral fermions in their own dimensions without introducing mirror fermions under the domain wall fermion construction.

AB Aphasia is a language disorder that affects the speaking ability of millions of patients. This paper presents a new benchmark for Aphasia speech recognition and detection tasks using state-of-the-art speech recognition techniques with the Aphsia-Bank dataset. Specifically, we introduce two multi-task learning methods based on the CTC/Attention architecture to perform both tasks simultaneously. Our system achieves state-of-the-art speaker-level detection accuracy (97.3%), and a relative WER reduction of 11% for moderate Aphasia patients. In addition, we demonstrate the generalizability of our approach by applying it to another disordered speech database, the Dementia-Bank Pitt corpus. We will make our all-in-one recipes and pre-trained model publicly available to facilitate reproducibility. Our standardized data preprocessing pipeline and open-source recipes enable researchers to compare results directly, promoting progress in disordered speech processing.

AB The computational spectroscopy of water has proven to be a powerful tool for probing the structure and dynamics of chemical systems and for providing atomistic insight into experimental vibrational spectroscopic results. However, such calculations have been limited for biochemical systems due to the lack of empirical vibrational frequency maps for the TIP3P water model, which is used in many popular biomolecular force fields. Here, we develop an empirical map for the TIP3P model and evaluate its efficacy for reproducing the experimental vibrational spectroscopy of water. We observe that the calculated infrared and Raman spectra are blueshifted and narrowed compared to the experimental spectra. Further analysis finds that the blueshift originates from a shifted distribution of frequencies, rather than other dynamical effects, suggesting that the TIP3P model forms a significantly different electrostatic environment than other three-point water models. This is explored further by examining the two-dimensional infrared spectra, which demonstrates that the blueshift is significant for the first two vibrational transitions. Similarly, spectral diffusion timescales, evaluated through both the center line slope and the frequency-frequency time correlation function demonstrate that TIP3P exhibits significantly faster spectral dynamics than other three-point models. Finally, sum-frequency generation spectroscopy calculations suggest that despite these challenges, the TIP3P empirical map can provide phenomenological, qualitative, insight into the behavior of water at the air-water and lipid-water interfaces. As these interfaces are models for hydrophobic and hydrophilic environments observed in biochemical systems, the presently developed empirical map will be useful for future studies of biochemical systems.

TI Plasma nitridation for atomic layer etching of Ni

DT Article
ID NICKEL; OXIDATION; NITROGEN; COPPER
AB Nickel (Ni) and its alloys are important multifunctional materials for the fabrication of integrated circuits, as either the absorber for the extreme ultraviolet lithography masks and/or interconnect metals at the nanometer scale. However, these applications require that Ni to be patterned controllably, selectively, and anisotropically-requirements that can only be met with a plasma based atomic layer etch (ALE) process. In this work, a plasma-thermal ALE approach is developed to pattern Ni, utilizing a nitrogen plasma to form NixN at the surface, formic acid (FA) vapor to selectively remove the NixN layer, and a low-energy Ar+ sputter process to remove carbon residue left by the FA prior to the subsequent nitridation step. This three step ALE process was shown effective to etch Ni with a rate of 1.3 +/- 0.17 nm/cycle while maintaining surface smoothness.

AB Children face increasing privacy risks and the need to navigate complex choices, while privacy education is not sufficient due to limited education scope and family involvement. We advocate for informal learning spaces (ILS) as a pioneering channel for family-based privacy education, given their established role in holistic technology and digital literacy education, which specifically targets family groups. In this paper, we conducted an interview study with five families to understand revealing current approaches to privacy education and engagement with ILS for family-based learning. Our findings highlight ILS's trans-formative potential in family privacy education, considering existing practices and challenges. We discuss the reason for family-based privacy education in ILS and identify potential design opportunities. Additionally, we outline our future work, which involves expanding participant involvement and conducting co-design activities with family groups to create design prototypes.

ID END
AB End-to-end speech summarization has been shown to improve performance over cascade baselines. However, such models are difficult to train on very large inputs (dozens of minutes or hours) owing to computing restrictions and are hence trained with truncated model inputs. Truncation leads to poorer models, and a solution to this problem rests in block-wise modeling, i.e., processing a portion of the input frames at a time. In this paper, we develop a method that allows one to train summarization models on very long sequences in an incremental manner. Speech summarization is realized as a streaming process, where hypothesis summaries are updated every block based on new acoustic information. We devise and test strategies to pass semantic context across the blocks. Experiments on the How2 dataset demonstrate that the proposed block-wise training method improves by 3 points absolute on ROUGE-L over a truncated input baseline.

AB The CALPHAD framework rests on the ability to assign well-defined free energies to all phases, including mechanically unstable ones. Given the experimental difficulties associated with the latter, researchers have turned to computational methods to obtain a theoretically justified definition of the free energy of mechanically unstable phases. Recently, a method called "inflection detection"has been shown to yield free energies that are broadly consistent with the current SGTE (Scientific Group Thermodata Europe) standard for pure elements, which were obtained through an extrapolation of stable solid solutions free energies towards unstable end members. Despite this general agreement, apparent failures for a few elements stand out, notably for the bcc- fcc enthalpy difference for the common element Al. Here we revisit the definition of the bcc Al enthalpy and show that a careful CALPHAD-based analysis of enthalpy trends in five different mechanically stable binary solid solutions in fact does agree very well with the inflection-detection approach.

AB High-electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) employing AlGaN/GaN heterostructures are suitable for high-power and high-frequency applications. To meet target specifications, GaN HEMTs must be designed and optimized by accurately considering the coupling of electrical and thermal characteristics, from the static to the pulsed regimes of operation. Toward this, we implement an electro-thermal modeling and simulation framework for experimentally fabricated GaN on SiC HEMTs and use the framework to predict the high-temperature performance of the technology, up to 448 K. We utilize the transient measurement data at different ambient temperatures to extract the trap characteristics, which are important to understand from the RF dispersion perspective. Our work highlights the significance of the thermal boundary conditions at the source, drain, and gate metal electrodes and the impact of heat dissipation paths on the lattice temperature rise and I-V characteristics. Overall, our work provides a physical insight into the thermal response of GaN HEMTs and can facilitate suitable thermal management strategies of the device over a broad range of DC and transient operating conditions.

AB We propose here a lightweight, reconfigurable graphene-based physical unclonable function (PUF) for wireless identification and authentication applications. Specifically, the PUF-based anti-counterfeiting label consists of a micro-coil antenna and a graphene quantum capacitor, forming an LC oscillator. Natural fluctuations in the Dirac point and residue charge density of graphene enable each graphene oscillator to have a unique radio-frequency (RF) response (i.e., electromagnetic fingerprint), whose uniqueness and entropy can be further enhanced by exploiting the exceptional point (EP)-based (near-field) wireless interrogation system. These randomized and irreproducible RF responses can be properly discretized and digitized to form a binary bitmap of cryptographic keys. Our simulation results show that PUF keys generated by graphene oscillators can exhibit high uniqueness and randomness, large encoding capacity, as well as reconfigurability enabled by electrostatically or chemically tuning the graphene's Fermi energy. The proposed PUF-based wireless anti-counterfeiting labels may open a new pathway for the development of lightweight security protocol for radio-frequency identification (RFID), near-field communications (NFC), wireless access control, and Internet-of-things (IoTs), among other wireless applications.

ID SHEAR VISCOSITY
AB Using classical equilibrium and nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations together with an optimized, many-body embedded atom model EAM potential, the shear viscosity of liquid iron is calculated over the entire range of temperatures within which it is in its liquid phase and over a range of shear rates. The radial distribution function is also calculated for each of these molecular simulation systems. The validity of the results is assessed against computational, experimental, and theoretical observations. The shear viscosity obtained from equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations may not be a sufficient representation of actual values due to the combined effects of temperature and shear rate. Shear dilatant behavior was also observed at higher shear rates and could impact the local structure of liquid iron and the resulting flow dynamics.

AB The stereochemistry of the uncatalyzed chlorolactonization of 4-phenylpent-4-enoic acid at room temperature was examined to probe the reaction's intrinsic diastereoselectivities as a function of chlorenium ion donor, solvent polarity, and reactant concentration ranges. Kinetic studies using Variable Time Normalization Analysis (VTNA) revealed differing reaction orders for the syn and anti alkene addition processes. Aided and illustrated by quantum chemical modeling, this detailed mechanistic analysis of the substrate's intrinsic chlorolactonization reactions points to concerted AdE3-type paths for both syn and anti additions. By illuminating the factors selecting for syn- vs anti-addition paths, the results provide key reference points for future studies of stereocontrol in halofunctionalization reactions.

ID OSMOTIC EFFICIENCY COEFFICIENTS; DIFFUSION
AB Geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) comprising sodium bentonite (NaB) have been shown to exhibit significant membrane behavior, whereby contaminants are restricted from passing through the clay due to electrostatic repulsion, potentially enhancing long-term containment performance. Recent membrane behavior research has focused on evaluating membrane efficiency (omega) of enhanced bentonites (e.g., bentonite polymer composites) and testing under more complex conditions (e.g., elevated temperatures and unsaturated conditions), often drawing comparisons with earlier published data on NaB-GCLs. However, the validity of comparing NaB-GCL results across studies and from earlier work remains unclear. No prior study has evaluated the variability in reported. values for the same type of NaB-GCL manufactured in different years. In this study, multistage membrane behavior tests were performed on specimens of the same NaB-GCL type manufactured at different dates. One specimen (GCL1) was taken from a NaB-GCL roll manufactured in the last five years. Another specimen (GCL2) was taken from a NaB- GCL roll that had been stored in a laboratory since 2005. Values of omega were measured for both specimens and also compared to results reported in 2002 for the same type of NaB-GCL (GCL3). To support interpretation of the results, cation exchange capacity, mass per unit area, and swell index tests also were performed. For the same salt solution concentrations, GCL2 exhibited significantly lower. than GCL1 and GCL3. Lower values of omega corresponded to lower bentonite mass per unit area. The results have important implications regarding limitations in comparing results of current membrane behavior research on enhanced materials and testing conditions to commonly cited literature data.

AB Nyx is a nearby, prograde, and high-eccentricity stellar stream physically contained in the thick disk, but its origin is unknown. Nyx could be the remnant of a disrupted dwarf galaxy, in which case the associated dark matter substructure could affect terrestrial dark matter direct-detection experiments. Alternatively, Nyx could be a signature of the Milky Way's disk formation and evolution. To determine the origin of Nyx, we obtained high-resolution spectroscopy of 34 Nyx stars using Keck/HIRES and Magellan/MIKE. A differential chemical abundance analysis shows that most Nyx stars reside in a metal-rich ([Fe/H] > -1) high-alpha component that is chemically indistinguishable from the thick disk. This rules out the originally suggested scenario that Nyx is the remnant of a single massive dwarf galaxy merger. However, we also identify 5 substantially more metal-poor stars ([Fe/H] similar to -2.0) whose chemical abundances are similar to those of the metal-weak thick disk. It remains unclear how stars that are chemically identical to the thick disk can be on such prograde, high-eccentricity orbits. We suggest two most likely scenarios: that Nyx is the result of an early minor dwarf galaxy merger, or that it is a record of the early spin-up of the Milky Way disk-although neither perfectly reproduces the chemodynamic observations. The most likely formation scenarios suggest that future spectroscopic surveys should find Nyx-like structures outside of the solar neighborhood.

AB Biological signals, such as electroencephalograms (EEG), play a crucial role in numerous clinical applications, exhibiting diverse data formats and quality profiles. Current deep learning models for biosignals (based on CNN, RNN, and Transformers) are typically specialized for specific datasets and clinical settings, limiting their broader applicability. This paper explores the development of a flexible biosignal encoder architecture that can enable pre-training on multiple datasets and fine-tuned on downstream biosignal tasks with different formats.
   To overcome the unique challenges associated with biosignals of various formats, such as mismatched channels, variable sample lengths, and prevalent missing values, we propose Biosignal Transformer (BIOT). The proposed BIOT model can enable cross-data learning with mismatched channels, variable lengths, and missing values by tokenizing different biosignals into unified "sentences" structure. Specifically, we tokenize each channel separately into fixed-length segments containing local signal features and then re-arrange the segments to form a long "sentence". Channel embeddings and relative position embeddings are added to each segment (viewed as "token") to preserve spatio-temporal features.
   The BIOT model is versatile and applicable to various biosignal learning settings across different datasets, including joint pre-training for larger models. Comprehensive evaluations on EEG, electrocardiogram (ECG), and human activity sensory signals demonstrate that BIOT outperforms robust baselines in common settings and facilitates learning across multiple datasets with different formats. Using CHB-MIT seizure detection task as an example, our vanilla BIOT model shows 3% improvement over baselines in balanced accuracy, and the pre-trained BIOT models (optimized from other data sources) can further bring up to 4% improvements.

   Breathing Kagome Materials
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS

AB Multiferroic materials, known for their multiple tunable orders, present an exceptional opportunity to manipulate nonlinear optical responses that are sensitive to symmetry. In this study, we propose leveraging electric and magnetic fields to selectively control and switch specific types of photogalvanic effects in two-dimensional multiferroic breathing kagome materials. Taking monolayer Nb3I8 as an example, we demonstrate that the shift current, characterized by the real-space shift of electrons and holes, is predominantly unaffected by magnetic order. In contrast, injection current, featured by quantum metric dipole in momentum space, is closely related to valley polarization, which can be controlled by a magnetic field. Furthermore, both photocurrents can be reversed by an out-of-plane electric field via lattice breathing. Our findings reveal the potential of multiferroic breathing kagome structures for multifunctional optoelectronic applications and sensors.

AB Analogies are used to make abstract topics meaningful and more easily comprehensible to learners. Incorporating simple analogies into STEM classrooms is a fairly common practice, but the analogies are typically generated and explained by the instructor for the learners. We hypothesize that challenging learners to create complex, extended analogies themselves can promote integration of content knowledge and development of critical thinking skills, which are essential for deep learning, but are challenging to teach. In this qualitative study, college biology students (n = 30) were asked to construct a complex analogy about the flow of genetic information using a familiar item. One week later, participants constructed a second analogy about the same topic, but this time using a more challenging item. Twenty participants worked on the challenging analogy in pairs, while the other 10 worked alone. Analysis of the 50 interviews resulted in a novel-scoring scheme, which measured both content knowledge (understanding of biology terms) and critical thinking (alignment of relationships between elements of the analogy). Most participants improved slightly due to practice, but they improved dramatically when working with a partner. The biggest gains were seen in critical thinking, not content knowledge. Having students construct complex, sophisticated analogies in pairs is a high-impact practice that can help students develop their critical thinking skills, which are crucial in academic and professional settings. The discussion between partners likely requires students to justify their explanations and critique their partner's explanations, which are characteristics of critical thinking.

AB Undoubtedly, quantum computing offers valuable acceleration for solving intricate problems. One of the primary hurdles lies in executing large-scale quantum applications on backend machines. Qubit noise, among other factors, dramatically influences the execution process. Implementing effective scheduling techniques for quantum circuits is crucial for practical quantum computing and preventing excessive waiting times. The quantum realm is distinct from classical computing in terms of optimization, performance, utilization, and waiting periods. Consequently, the parameters and components of quantum circuit scheduling diverge from those of classical computing. This paper presents Quantum Noise Mitigation: Introducing the Robust Quantum Circuit Scheduler for Enhanced Fidelity and Throughput, a straightforward yet effective scheduling framework and policy that enhances noise resilience, throughput, and the fidelity of quantum circuits. Drawing inspiration from classical methods, our scheduling approach incorporates additional constraints tailored for quantum logic. The outcome demonstrates a substantial improvement in fidelity and resource management, which is vital for real-world quantum applications.

AB Herein high-strength composites are prepared from elemental sulfur, sunflower oil, and wastewater sludge. Fats extracted from dissolved air flotation (DAF) solids were reacted with elemental sulfur to yield composite DAFS (10 wt% DAF fats and 90 wt% sulfur). Additional composites were prepared from DAF fat, sunflower oil and sulfur to give SunDAFx (x = wt% sulfur, varied from 85-90%). The composites were characterized by spectroscopic, thermal, and mechanical methods. FT-IR spectra revealed a notable peak at 798 cm-1 indicating a C-S stretch in DAFS, SunDAF90, and SunDAF85 indicating successful crosslinking of polymeric sulfur with olefin units. SEM/EDX analysis revealed homogenous distribution of carbon, oxygen, and sulfur in SunDAF90 and SunDAF85. The percent crystallinity exhibited by DAFS (37%), SunDAF90 (39%), and SunDAF85 (45%) was observed to be slightly lower than that of previous composites prepared from elemental sulfur and fats and oils. DAFS and SunDAFx displayed compressive strengths (26.4-38.7 MPa) of up to 227% above that required (17 MPa) of ordinary Portland cement for residential building foundations. The composite decomposition temperatures ranged from 211 to 219 degrees C, with glass transition temperatures of - 37 degrees C to - 39 degrees C. These composites thus provide a potential route to reclaim wastewater organics for use in value-added structural materials having mechanical properties competitive with those of commercial products.

AB A laboratory experiment has been designed for teaching laboratories aimed at training students in the basics of spectroscopy in junior and senior level undergraduate chemistry courses. Despite the ubiquity of light-based tools in modern science, students often find it difficult to comprehend light and light-matter interactions. A portable spectrometer is utilized to record the fluorescence spectra of various lasers and molecular samples in the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Three different wavelength laser sources are utilized to excite the molecular samples. Students record the experimental emission spectra from the lasers as well as from the provided inorganic and organic samples, and analyze the resulting spectra for fluorescence wavelength, spectral peak widths, and intensity. These experimental results help students understand and appreciate the quantum theory of spectroscopy. Several conceptual and reasoning difficulties among students in relating the emission spectra to energy levels of atoms and molecules are reduced by these laboratory activities and exercises. Furthermore, these laboratory exercises may stimulate research interest in students as they look forward in their careers. Although this experiment is designed for typical laboratory settings, it can be utilized in other laboratories or in outdoor environments due to the portable nature of the instrument which contains mini lasers, a mini spectrometer, and a laptop computer.

AB Recent marine heatwaves in the Gulf of Alaska have had devastating impacts on species from various trophic levels. Due to climate change, total heat exposure in the upper ocean has become longer, more intense, more frequent, and more likely to happen at the same time as other environmental extremes. The combination of multiple environmental extremes can exacerbate the response of sensitive marine organisms. Our hindcast simulation provides the first indication that more than 20% of the bottom water of the Gulf of Alaska continental shelf was exposed to quadruple heat, positive hydrogen ion concentration [H+], negative aragonite saturation state (omega arag), and negative oxygen concentration [O2] compound extreme events during the 2018-2020 marine heat wave. Natural intrusion of deep and acidified water combined with the marine heat wave triggered the first occurrence of these events in 2019. During the 2013-2016 marine heat wave, surface waters were already exposed to widespread marine heat and positive [H+] compound extreme events due to the temperature effect on the [H+]. We introduce a new Gulf of Alaska Downwelling Index (GOADI) with short-term predictive skill, which can serve as indicator of past and near-future positive [H+], negative omega arag, and negative [O2] compound extreme events near the shelf seafloor. Our results suggest that the marine heat waves may have not been the sole environmental stressor that led to the observed ecosystem impacts and warrant a closer look at existing in situ inorganic carbon and other environmental data in combination with biological observations and model output.
   The Gulf of Alaska supports a rich ocean ecosystem and valuable fisheries. Climate change and ocean acidification threaten to disrupt marine life in the region from plankton to fish, marine mammals, and sea birds. The gradual build-up of these environmental pressures can be exacerbated further by short-term extreme events, such as marine heat waves, that can temporarily push ocean conditions beyond physiological and ecological thresholds for some organisms. The problem is worsened by the co-occurrence of extreme events for multiple factors, for example, heat and acidity. Our analysis using a regional ocean model indicates that such compound extreme events have become more frequent and intense with time in the Gulf of Alaska, raising concerns for vulnerable parts of the ecosystem. Improvements in model forecasts and observing systems may help by providing advanced warning of compound extreme events and be useful to fisheries and marine resource managers as they develop climate adaptation strategies.

AB The structure and dynamics of water at charged graphene interfaces fundamentally influence molecular responses to electric fields with implications for applications in energy storage, catalysis, and surface chemistry. Leveraging the realism of the MB-pol data-driven many-body potential and advanced path-integral quantum dynamics, we analyze the vibrational sum frequency generation (vSFG) spectrum of graphene/water interfaces under varying surface charges. Our quantum simulations reveal a distinctive dangling OH peak in the vSFG spectrum at neutral graphene, consistent with recent experimental findings yet markedly different from those of earlier studies. As the graphene surface becomes positively charged, interfacial water molecules reorient, decreasing the intensity of the dangling OH peak as the OH groups turn away from the graphene. In contrast, water molecules orient their OH bonds toward negatively charged graphene, leading to a prominent dangling OH peak in the corresponding vSFG spectrum. This charge-induced reorganization generates a diverse range of hydrogen-bonding topologies at the interface driven by variations in the underlying electrostatic interactions. Importantly, these structural changes extend into deeper water layers, creating an unequal distribution of molecules with OH bonds pointing toward and away from the graphene sheet. This imbalance amplifies bulk spectral features, underscoring the complexity of many-body interactions that shape the molecular structure of water at charged graphene interfaces.

AB The MPET2 model couples the multi-network poroelastic theory (MPET) with solute transport equations and provides predictions of the material deformation, fluid dynamics, and solute transport in different compartments of a deformable multiple-porosity medium. MPET2 offers a comprehensive framework for understanding complex porous media across multiple disciplines. Examples of its applications include studying rock formations, soil mechanics and subsurface reservoirs, investigating biological tissues, modeling groundwater flow and contaminant transport, and optimizing the design of porous materials. Despite the wide range of applications of the model, its numerical discretization has received little attention. Here we propose a stabilized formulation of the MPET2 model. To address the unique challenges posed by the discretization of the MPET2 model, we use multiple techniques including the Fluid Pressure Laplacian stabilization, Streamline Upwind Petrov- Galerkin stabilization, and discontinuity capturing. Our spatial discretization is based on Isogeometric Analysis with higher-order continuity basis functions. The fully discretized governing equations are solved simultaneously with a monolithic algorithm. We perform a convergence study of the proposed formulation. Then, we conduct a series of simulations of subcutaneous injection of monoclonal antibodies under different injection conditions. Our simulations show that the stabilized MPET2 formulation can provide oscillation-free solutions for tissue deformation, fluid flow in the interstitial tissue, blood vessels, and lymphatic vessels, drug absorption in blood vessels and lymphatic vessels, as well as drug transport in each compartment. We also study the effects of different injection conditions on drug absorption, showing the potential of the proposed model and algorithm in the future optimization of injection strategy.

AB The everlasting fight between security researchers and ransomware authors, including cyber criminals who leverage ransomware to cripple organizations worldwide, has continued to evolve as novel techniques are used to evade ransomware detection. The victim not only endures paramount financial loss from business downtime for several days and/or paying ransom to regain control of their environment but also becomes at risk of being exposed to the stolen digital assets out on the Internet. To tackle these threats against ransomware, our research project aims to identify (1) structural similarities among 2,436 cryptographic Windows ransomware samples per calendar year between 2017 and 2021 and (2) structural dissimilarities against 3,014 benign applications using machine learning classifiers. We base our analysis on PE metadata for similarity analysis and binary classification tasks. With the Cosine Index, we capture 71% - 87.80% and 66% - 82.30% of similarities based on imports and function names feature spaces, respectively. On the other hand, after designing four experimental settings, Random Forest outperforms other applied classifiers by achieving 91.75%, 91.99%, 90.47%, and 91.05% at best for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores, respectively, for ransomware detection.

AB Transparent ultrasound transducers (TUTs) have gained significant traction in the fields of photoacoustic (PA) and ultrasound (US) applications. TUTs possess the unique capability to transmit and receive ultrasound waves while maintaining optical transparency. As a result, TUTs simplify the PA imaging process and facilitate seamless integration with other optical imaging modalities. However, the limited sensitivity of TUTs has been a primary challenge hampering their widespread adoption in PA setups. One often overlooked factor contributing to this limitation is the electrical impedance mismatch between the transducer and the data acquisition system. Here, we designed and studied the utilization of a filter-based electrical impedance matching (EIM) circuits to enhance the sensitivity of lithium niobate-based TUTs. In our approach, the fabricated TUTs incorporate a quarter-wavelength Parylene-C matching layer and epoxy as a backing layer. Our results demonstrate that the integration of the EIM circuit yields substantial improvements in the sensitivity, bandwidth and axial resolution of both pulse-echo US signals and PA signals. PA imaging of leaf phantoms were compared with and without EIMs to further showcase the performance enhancements that can be achieved by integrating EIM with TUTs. Overall, these results demonstrate that EIM circuits can be employed to improve the performance of TUTs.

AB Asphaltenes, a distinct class of molecules found in crude oil, exhibit insolubility in nonpolar solvents like n-heptane but are soluble in aromatic solvents such as toluene and benzene. Understanding asphaltenes is crucial in the petroleum industry due to their detrimental effects on oil processing, resulting in significant economic losses and production disruptions. While no singular structure defines asphaltenes, two major molecular architectures, namely archipelago and continental models, have gained wide acceptance for their consistency with various experimental investigations and subsequent use in computational studies. The archipelago model comprises two or more polyaromatic hydrocarbon entities interconnected via aliphatic side chains. In contrast, the island or continental model features a unified polyaromatic hydrocarbon moiety with 4 to 10 fused aromatic rings, averaging around 7 rings. To establish a comprehensive collection, we meticulously curated over 250 asphaltene structures derived from previous experimental and computational studies in this field. Our curation process involved an extensive literature survey, conversion of figures from publications into molecular structure files, careful verification of conversion accuracy, and structure editing to ensure alignment with molecular formulas. Our database pro-vides digital structure files and optimized geometries for both predominant structural motifs. The optimization procedure commenced with the PM6 semi-empirical method, followed by further optimization utilizing density functional theory employing the B3LYP functional and the 6-31 +G(d,p) basis set. Furthermore, we compiled a range of structural and electronic features for these molecules, serving as a valuable foundation for employing machine learning algorithms to investigate asphaltenes. This work provides a ready to use structural database of asphaltenes and sets the stage for future research endeavours in this domain.(c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Accurate service demand forecasts at critical facilities are fundamental for efficiently managing resources and promptly providing essential services to people and community. However, it has received little attention in the literature, mainly due to the unavailability of granular data and the lack of sophisticated forecasting methods. To address this gap, we provide a new perspective on sensing service demands at critical facilities leveraging fine-grained human mobility data, and propose a novel data-driven framework to forecast mobility patterns at the neighborhood level. Specifically, we develop a two-stage forecasting scheme to manage large-scale and complex human movement information. The first stage is to decompose the large-scale mobility data into spatial and temporal patterns, whereas the second stage is to model complex temporal dynamics using multivariate time series analysis. The proposed framework is implemented using real human mobility data obtained from mobile phone users. The results show that our model demonstrates the best predictive performance for varying forecast horizons, when compared to multiple benchmark methods including traditionally-used statistical and deep learning models. We also performed model robustness checks, showing that the proposed model is robust in making short-term and long-term forecasts. The proposed predictive framework could help businesses and local governments accurately forecast service demands for critical facilities for better allocating their resources.

AB We report the development and testing of new integrated cyberinfrastructure for performing free energy simulations with generalized hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) and machine learning potentials (MLPs) in Amber. The Sander molecular dynamics program has been extended to leverage fast, density-functional tight-binding models implemented in the DFTB+ and xTB packages, and an interface to the DeePMD-kit software enables the use of MLPs. The software is integrated through application program interfaces that circumvent the need to perform "system calls" and enable the incorporation of long-range Ewald electrostatics into the external software's self-consistent field procedure. The infrastructure provides access to QM/MM models that may serve as the foundation for QM/MM-Delta MLP potentials, which supplement the semiempirical QM/MM model with a MLP correction trained to reproduce ab initio QM/MM energies and forces. Efficient optimization of minimum free energy pathways is enabled through a new surface-accelerated finite-temperature string method implemented in the FE-ToolKit package. Furthermore, we interfaced Sander with the i-PI software by implementing the socket communication protocol used in the i-PI client-server model. The new interface with i-PI allows for the treatment of nuclear quantum effects with semiempirical QM/MM-Delta MLP models. The modular interoperable software is demonstrated on proton transfer reactions in guanine-thymine mispairs in a B-form deoxyribonucleic acid helix. The current work represents a considerable advance in the development of modular software for performing free energy simulations of chemical reactions that are important in a wide range of applications.

AB Using the 1D Majda-McLaughlin-Tabak model as an example, we develop numerical experiments to study the validity of the wave kinetic equation (WKE) at the kinetic limit (i.e., small nonlinearity and large domain). We show that the dynamics converge to the WKE prediction, in terms of the closure model and energy flux, when the kinetic limit is approached. When the kinetic limit is combined with a process of widening the inertial range, the theoretical Kolmogorov constant can be recovered numerically to a very high precision.

AB We explore the crystal structure and ionic conductivity of unfilled and cellulose nanowhisker-filled polymer electrolytes, based on high molecular weight PEO and LiClO4 at a concentration EO:Li = 6:1 (EO = ether oxygen). At this concentration, the polymer electrolyte forms crystalline PEO6 (PEOy-the crystal structure co-crystallizes "y" PEO ether oxygens to one Li-anion pair). While the diffraction patterns for PEO3 and PEO6 with LiClO4 are available, their structures are not. Thus, we optimize these structures using density functional theory and show agreement between simulated and experimental diffraction patterns. The PEO6 crystal shows insufficient Li-ion conductivity due to a lack of percolated conduction paths, and the crystal structure is unstable following 2 months after annealing. Cellulose nanowhiskers, with their patterned surface -OH groups, extend the length of PEO6 tunnels, stabilize these tunnels for as long as a year, and result in the percolation of crystals. Although the EO:Li = 6:1 stoichiometry should not favor PEO3 formation, we observe this crystal phase in some unfilled samples. But, with the addition of nanowhiskers, the patterned surface templates PEO6 formation rather than PEO3. Despite these advantages, nanowhiskers do not improve ionic conductivity as hypothesized. The tools developed in this work allow further mechanistic exploration of conduction through crystalline domains.

TI Secretary Problems with Biased Evaluations Using Partial Ordinal

SO MANAGEMENT SCIENCE

DT Article
DE secretary problem; bias; online selection; affirmative action
ID STEREOTYPE THREAT
AB The k-secretary problem deals with online selection of at most k numerically scored applicants, where selection decisions are immediate upon their arrival and irrevocable, with the goal of maximizing total score. There is, however, wide prevalence of bias in evaluations of applicants from different demographic groups (e.g., gender, age, race), and the assumption of an algorithm observing their true score is unreasonable in practice. In this work, we propose the poset secretary problem, where selection decisions must be made by observing a partial order over the applicants. This partial order is constructed to account for uncertainty and biases in applicant scores. We assume that each applicant has a fixed score, which is not visible to the algorithm and is consistent with the partial order. Using a random partitioning technique from the matroid secretary literature, we provide order-optimal competitive algorithms for the poset secretary problem and provide matching lower bounds. Further, we develop the theory of thresholding in posets to provide a tight, adaptive-thresholding algorithm under regimes where k grows quickly enough, thus matching the adaptiveness to k shown for the classical k-secretary problem. We then study a special case, in which applicants belong tog disjoint demographic groups and the bias is group specific. We provide competitive algorithms for adversarial and stochastic variants of this special case, including a framework, Gap, for parallelizing any vanilla k-secretary algorithm to the group setting. Finally, we perform a case study on real-world data to demonstrate the responsiveness of our algorithms to data and their impact on selection rates.

AB Given two strings of length n over alphabet Sigma, and an upper bound k on their edit distance, the algorithm of Myers (Algorithmica86) and Landau and Vishkin (JCSS88) from almost forty years back computes the unweighted string edit distance in O(n+k(2)) time. To date, it remains the fastest algorithm for exact edit distance computation, and it is optimal under the Strong Exponential Hypothesis (Backurs and Indyk; STOC15). Over the years, this result has inspired many developments, including fast approximation algorithms for string edit distance as well as similar (O) over tilde (n+poly(k))-time algorithms for generalizations to tree and Dyck edit distances. Surprisingly, all these results hold only for unweighted instances.
   While unweighted edit distance is theoretically fundamental, almost all real-world applications require weighted edit distance, where different weights are assigned to different edit operations (insertions, deletions, and substitutions), and the weights may vary with the characters being edited. Given a weight function w : Sigma boolean OR{epsilon} x Sigma boolean OR{epsilon} -> R->= 0 (such that w(a,a) = 0 and w(a,b) >= 1 for all a, b is an element of Sigma boolean OR{epsilon} with a not equal b ), the goal is to find an alignment that minimizes the total weight of edits. Except for the vanilla O(n(2))-time dynamic-programming algorithm and its almost trivial O(nk)-time implementation (k being an upper bound on the sought total weight), none of the aforementioned developments on the unweighted edit distance applies to the weighted variant. In this paper, we propose the first O(n+poly(k))-time algorithm that computes the weighted string edit distance exactly, thus bridging a fundamental decades-old gap between our understanding of unweighted and weighted edit distance. We then generalize this result to the weighted tree and Dyck edit distances, bringing in several new techniques, which lead to a deterministic algorithm that improves upon the previous work even for unweighted tree edit distance. Given how fundamental weighted edit distance is, we believe our O(n+poly(k))-time algorithm will be instrumental for further significant developments in the area.

ID FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; ANOMALY DETECTION
AB Conformal inference provides a general distribution-free method to rigorously calibrate the output of any machine learning algorithm for novelty detection. While this approach has many strengths, it has the limitation of being randomized, in the sense that it may lead to different results when analyzing twice the same data, and this can hinder the interpretation of any findings. We propose to make conformal inferences more stable by leveraging suitable conformal e-values instead of p-values to quantify statistical significance. This solution allows the evidence gathered from multiple analyses of the same data to be aggregated effectively while provably controlling the false discovery rate. Further, we show that the proposed method can reduce randomness without much loss of power compared to standard conformal inference, partly thanks to an innovative way of weighting conformal e-values based on additional side information carefully extracted from the same data. Simulations with synthetic and real data confirm this solution can be effective at eliminating random noise in the inferences obtained with state-of-the-art alternative techniques, sometimes also leading to higher power.

AB The increase of disinformation in scientific news across a variety of domains has generated an urgency for a robust and generalizable approach to automated scientific claim verification (SCV). Available methods of SCV are limited in either domain adaptability or scalability. To facilitate building and evaluating more robust models on SCV we propose MSVEC, a multidomain dataset containing 200 pairs of verified scientific news claims with evidence research papers. To understand the capability of large language models on the SCV task, we evaluated GPT-3.5 against MSVEC. While methods of fact-checking exist for specific domains (e.g., political and health), the use of large language models exhibits better generalizability across multiple domains and is potentially compared with state-of-the-art models based on word embeddings. The data and software used and developed for this project are available at https://github.com/lamps-lab/msvec.

DT Review
DE bias; face perception; machine learning; methods
AB Advances in computer science-specifically in the development and use of generative machine learning-have provided powerful new tools for psychologists to create synthetic human faces as stimuli, which ultimately provide high-quality photorealistic face images that have many advantages, including reducing typical ethical and privacy concerns and generating face images from minoritized communities that are typically underrepresented in existing face databases. However, there are a number of ways that using machine learning-based face generation and manipulation software can introduce bias into the research process, thus threatening the validity of studies. The present article provides a summary of how one class of recently popular algorithms for generating faces-generative adversarial networks (GANs)-works, how we control GANs, and where biases (with a particular focus on racial biases) emerge throughout these processes. We discuss recommendations for mitigating these biases, as well as how these concepts manifest in similar modern text-to-image algorithms.

TI Optimum surface-passivation schemes for near-surface spin defects in

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS
LA English
DT Article
ID VACANCY; CENTERS
AB Spin-active defects in silicon carbide (SiC) are promising quantum light sources for realizing scalable quantum technologies. In different applications, these photoluminescent defects are often placed in a nanostructured host or close to surfaces in order to enhance the signal from the defects. However, proximity to the surface not only modifies the frequencies of the quantum emission from the defect, but also adversely affects their photostability, resulting in blinking and/or photobleaching of the defect. These effects can be ameliorated by passivating surfaces with optimal adsorbates. In this work, we explore different passivation schemes using density-functional-theory-based calculations. We show that a uniform surface passivation with either hydrogen or with mixed hydrogen/hydroxyl groups completely removes surface states from the SiC band gap, restoring the optical properties of the defects.

AB The development of visual computing workflows for clients of the Advanced Visualization Lab (AVL) at Indiana University is challenged by ever larger client datasets. In particular, the varied computational infrastructure for client labs is frequently insufficient to analyze and process this data. The central research infrastructure at Indiana University (IU) is still largely focused on batch processing on clusters, with limited support for virtual desktops without GPU support. This has limited what the AVL can offer in the way of suggested strategies for working with such data. Jetstream 2 is a cloud-based infrastructure that is transforming our ability to provide support for powerful, interactive, visual computing to researchers at IU.

AB Extensive three-dimensional boundary-integral simulations are presented for the steady-state, low-Reynolds-number motion of a non-wetting deformable drop in another liquid on an inclined solid wall. The drop remains separated from the wall by a lubricating film. The boundary-integral formulation is based on the half-space Green function. The focus is on the challenging case of small tilt angles theta combined with high drop-to-medium viscosity ratios lambda, when the drop travels with strong hydrodynamical interaction very close to the wall. Simulations to steady state have required ultrahigh drop surface resolutions (to 3x10(5) boundary elements) achieved through multipole acceleration and combined with novel regularization to fully eliminate near-singular behaviour of the double-layer integrals due to small clearance. Non-dimensional drop speed U is presented for theta >= 7.5(degrees), lambda <= 300 and in a broad range of Bond numbers B, covering from nearly spherical to strongly pancaked drops. The results are consistent with published experiments on liquid-liquid systems. At small theta and lambda >> 1, U is a strong, decreasing function of B; the asymptotic regime U -> 0 at B -> 0 is not observed in the simulated range. For small B, the dimpled thin-film geometry is insensitive to lambda=1-300. For pancaked drops, the lubrication film is much thicker for lambda=1 than for lambda >> 1 drops. Approximate thin-film uniformity in the drop motion direction is confirmed for pancaked, but not for B << 1, drops. Kinematics of drop motion shows that neither perfect tank treading, nor perfect rolling can be approached for liquid-liquid systems in the purely hydrodynamical formulation. The methodology is applicable to other problems and can allow for direct inclusion of short-range colloidal forces in three-dimensional boundary-integral simulations.

AB A high-performance sulfur (S) cathode is essential for advanced lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Issues such as shuttle effect of polysulfides and low conductivity of S need to be resolved. Here, we report a S-cathode prepared via constructing unique decoupled ion-transport network formed from soy protein-based ionic conductor with well-dispersed graphene, leading to mitigated shuttle effect and excellent dual-conductive capabilities, i.e., high electronic and ionic conductivities. The decoupled ion-transport mechanism, which is unconventional in polymeric systems, is enabled by appropriately maintaining the denatured soy protein structure during the cathode preparation, facilitating polysulfide trapping and providing high adhesion for the S cathode, confirmed by the experiment and simulation results. Consequently, the Li-S battery with the protein-based S cathode demonstrates excellent rate performance and long cycling stability. In specific, the Li-S battery with the protein-based S cathode shows similar to 70 % capacity retention (similar to 504 mAh g(-1)) after 600 cycles under the current density of 0.5 A g(-1). This work will initiate new scientific studies on introducing an unconventional ion-transport mechanism into electrodes for producing high-performance batteries.

TI Dual Anchoring Mechanism of Protein-Based Binder for Lithium-Sulfur
   Batteries
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
LA English
DT Article
ID CATHODE
AB The development of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries has attracted significant attention, but their applications have been greatly hindered by the large volume change of sulfur (S) and the shuttle effect of soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). Recently, protein-based binder materials have been introduced on the S cathode and have demonstrated great potential in improving the battery performance. Here, we systematically investigate the binding mechanisms of LiPSs with different protein side chains through both first-principles density functional theory calculations and experiments. Our results show that peptides with positively charged side chains, such as Arg, have significantly higher binding energies with LiPSs compared to other types of peptides due to a dual anchoring mechanism. The dual anchoring mechanism significantly improved the binding energies of protein-based binders with LiPSs, but it was still within the stability limit. The findings are consistent with our experiments, where adding Arg amino acids into the protein-based S cathodes significantly improved the battery performance. The results and insights presented in this work will provide guidance on the design and optimization of protein-based binders for next-generation Li-S batteries.

AB The present study explores the mechanical behavior of tungsten (W) gyroid Triply Periodic Minimal Surface (gTPMS) lattice structures through atomistic simulations, focusing on models with varying lattice thickness or simply volume fractions. It examines the mechanical behavior of these structures under both tensile and compressive loads. The research demonstrates that strength and ductility in g-TPMS can be adjusted through design, showcasing unique behaviors not found in bulk materials. A relationship between elastic modulus and volume fraction is established, providing coefficients for multi-scale modeling and simulation. W g-TPMS structures with higher volume fractions exhibit increased tensile strength, peaking at approximately 7.6 GPa for structures with a 59 % volume fraction. The study further reveals that temperature variations significantly affect the mechanical response, with tensile strength decreasing from 4.5 GPa at 300 K to below 2.0 GPa at 3000 K. Additionally, helium embrittlement is shown to markedly reduce tensile strength, with a 15 % helium interstitial concentration leading to a 60 % reduction in peak stress. These findings emphasize the potential of tailored W gTPMS materials for advanced applications like nuclear fusion reactors.

AB Messenger RNA (mRNA)-based therapeutic agents have demonstrated significant potential in recent times, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. As a promising prophylactic and therapeutic strategy, polypeptide-based mRNA delivery systems attract significant interest because of their low cost, simple preparation, tuneable sizes and morphology, convenient large-scale production, biocompatibility, and biodegradability. In this review, we begin with a brief discussion of the synthesis of polypeptides, followed by a review of commonly used polypeptides in mRNA delivery, including classical polypeptides and cell-penetrating peptides. Then, the challenges against mRNA delivery, including extracellular, intracellular, and clinical barriers, are discussed in detail. Finally, we highlight a range of strategies for polypeptide-based mRNA delivery, offering valuable insights into the advancement of polypeptide-based mRNA carrier development.
   As a promising prophylactic and therapeutic strategy, polypeptide-based mRNA delivery systems attract significant interest because of their low cost, simple preparation, tuneable sizes and morphology, biocompatibility, and biodegradability.

AB We present a comprehensive study of generalized Wigner crystals across various filling factors for system sizes up to 162 holes employing Hartree-Fock theory and explicitly correlated wave function approaches. While we find broad agreement with the behavior observed in experiments and classical Monte Carlo simulations, we highlight the fact that the Hartree-Fock energy landscape appears to be remarkably complex, exhibiting many competing states, both ordered and disordered, separated by energies of a fraction of approximate to 1 meV/hole. We demonstrate which of the located states are metastable by performing a stability analysis at the Hartree-Fock level. Correlated wave function methods furthermore reveal small correlation energies that are nevertheless large enough to tip the balance of state ordering found within Hartree-Fock theory.

AB The explosion of AI across all facets of society has given rise to the need for AI education across domains and levels. AI literacy has become an important concept in the current technological landscape, emphasizing the need for individuals to acquire the necessary knowledge and skills to engage with AI systems. This systematic review examined 47 articles published between 2019 and 2023, focusing on recent work to capture new insights and initiatives given the burgeoning of the literature on this topic. In the initial stage, we explored the dataset to identify the themes covered by the selected papers and the target population for AI literacy efforts. We identified that the articles broadly contributed to one of the following themes: a) conceptualizing AI literacy, b) prompting AI literacy efforts, and c) developing AI literacy assessment instruments. We also found that a range of populations, from pre -K students to adults in the workforce, were targeted. In the second stage, we conducted a thorough content analysis to synthesize six key constructs of AI literacy: Recognize, Know and Understand, Use and Apply, Evaluate, Create, and Navigate Ethically. We then applied this framework to categorize a range of empirical studies and identify the prevalence of each construct across the studies. We subsequently review assessment instruments developed for AI literacy and discuss them. The findings of this systematic review are relevant for formal education and workforce preparation and advancement, empowering individuals to leverage AI and drive innovation.

AB Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are potential alternatives for common antibiotics because of their greater activity and efficiency against a broad range of viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites. In this project, two antimicrobial peptides including magainin 2 and protegrin 1 with alpha-helix and beta-sheet secondary structures were selected to investigate their interactions with different lipid bilayers such as 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine (POPS), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (POPG), and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE), POPC/POPG (7:3), POPC/POPS (7:3), POPG/POPE(1:3), and POPG/POPE(3:1). The obtained structures of the AMPs illustrated that protegrin 1 cannot maintain its secondary structure in the solution phase in contrast to magainin 2. The head groups of the lipid units play a key role in the stability of the lipid bilayers. The head parts of the lipid membranes by increasing the internal H-bond contribute to membrane compactness. The POPG and POPS units inside the POPC/POPG and POPC/POPS membranes increase the order of the POPC units. The cationic residues of the AMPs form remarkable electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged membrane surfaces, which play a key role in the stabilization process of the peptide secondary structures. The Arg residues of protegrin 1 and the Gly1, Lys4, Lys10, Lys11, Lys14, and Glu19 of the magainin 2 have the most important roles in the complexation process. The values of Gibbs binding energies (Delta G) indicate that the complexation process between AMPs and different bacterial membranes is favorable from the thermodynamic viewpoint and AMPs could form stable complexes with the lipid bilayers. As a result of Delta G values, protegrin 1 forms a more stable complex with POPG/POPE(3:1), while the alpha-helix has more affinity to the POPG/POPE(1:3) bacterial membranes. Therefore, it can be considered that beta-sheet and alpha-helix AMPs are more effective against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, respectively. The results of this study can provide useful details about the antimicrobial peptide interactions with the bacterial cell, which can be employed for designing new antimicrobial materials with greater efficiency.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

AB Gender biases are known to exist within large-scale visual datasets and can be reflected or even amplified in downstream models. Many prior works have proposed methods for mitigating gender biases, often by attempting to remove gender expression information from images. To understand the feasibility and practicality of these approaches, we investigate what "gender artifacts" exist in large-scale visual datasets. We define a "gender artifact" as a visual cue correlated with gender, focusing specifically on cues that are learnable by a modern image classifier and have an interpretable human corollary. Through our analyses, we find that gender artifacts are ubiquitous in the COCO and OpenImages datasets, occurring everywhere from low-level information (e.g., the mean value of the color channels) to higher-level image composition (e.g., pose and location of people). Further, bias mitigation methods that attempt to remove gender actually remove more information from the scene than the person. Given the prevalence of gender artifacts, we claim that attempts to remove these artifacts from such datasets are largely infeasible as certain removed artifacts may be necessary for the downstream task of object recognition. Instead, the responsibility lies with researchers and practitioners to be aware that the distribution of images within datasets is highly gendered and hence develop fairness-aware methods which are robust to these distributional shifts across groups.

AB Many reinforcement learning (RL) applications have combinatorial action spaces, where each action is a composition of sub-actions. A standard RL approach ignores this inherent factorization structure, resulting in a potential failure to make meaningful inferences about rarely observed sub-action combinations; this is particularly problematic for offline settings, where data may be limited. In this work, we propose a form of linear Q-function decomposition induced by factored action spaces. We study the theoretical properties of our approach, identifying scenarios where it is guaranteed to lead to zero bias when used to approximate the Q-function. Outside the regimes with theoretical guarantees, we show that our approach can still be useful because it leads to better sample efficiency without necessarily sacrificing policy optimality, allowing us to achieve a better bias-variance trade-off. Across several offline RL problems using simulators and real-world datasets motivated by healthcare, we demonstrate that incorporating factored action spaces into value-based RL can result in better-performing policies. Our approach can help an agent make more accurate inferences within underexplored regions of the state-action space when applying RL to observational datasets.

AB Commercialization of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries as a promising energy storage system, is primarily impeded by polysulfide shuttling and uncontrollable lithium dendrite growth. To address the issues for improving the performance of Li-S batteries, we decorate the separator with zein (corn protein) via a simple soaking process. Owing to strong zein-polysulfide interactions, the zein-soaked separator effectively enhances the polysulfidetrapping capability. Moreover, abundant functional groups of zein also stabilize Li-ion deposition, and thus suppresses the growth of Li dendrites. As a result, the resulting Li-S batteries exhibited enhanced electrochemical performance in terms of cycling stability, capacity retention, and rate capability. The soaking method used for coating zein on pristine separator offers a scalable solution for generating multifunctional separators toward commercialization.

AB Surface electromyography (sEMG) and high-density sEMG (HD-sEMG) biosignals have been extensively investigated for myoelectric control of prosthetic devices, neurorobotics, and more recently human-computer interfaces because of their capability for hand gesture recognition/prediction in a wearable and non-invasive manner. High intraday (same-day) performance has been reported. However, the interday performance (separating training and testing days) is substantially degraded due to the poor generalizability of conventional approaches over time, hindering the application of such techniques in real-life practices. There are limited recent studies on the feasibility of multi-day hand gesture recognition. The existing studies face a major challenge: the need for long sEMG epochs makes the corresponding neural interfaces impractical due to the induced delay in myoelectric control. This paper proposes a compact ViT-based network for multi-day dynamic hand gesture prediction. We tackle the main challenge as the proposed model only relies on very short HD-sEMG signal windows (i.e., 50 ms, accounting for only one-sixth of the convention for real-time myoelectric implementation), boosting agility and responsiveness. Our proposed model can predict 11 dynamic gestures for 20 subjects with an average accuracy of over 71% on the testing day, 3-25 days after training. Moreover, when calibrated on just a small portion of data from the testing day, the proposed model can achieve over 92% accuracy by retraining less than 10% of the parameters for computational efficiency.

AB We present the concept and design of physically unclonable function (PUF)-based cryptographic key generation, which exploits the uniqueness of electromagnetic signatures of radio frequency (RF)-transponder tags derived from random physical variations during manufacturing. When the RF tag is inductively coupled to a designated readout circuitry, forming the higher-order parity-time (PT) symmetry, high sensitivity, and high entropy near the system's divergent exceptional point (DEP) can maximize the difference in temporal/spectral responses among tags. Our results show that due to the DEP singularity, PUF keys generated by converting the temporal response into binary sequences can exhibit excellent encryption performance in terms of randomness, uniqueness, encoding capacity, and resilience to machine learning (ML)-based modeling attacks. This RF PUF technique may pave the way toward ultra-lightweight, low-cost, and efficient hardware security solutions for wireless identification and authentication in various applications, including but not limited to the security of near-field connectivity and telematics infrastructure, wireless access control, authentication protocols for Internet-of-Things (IoTs), and anti-counterfeiting labels for goods, foods, and drugs.

AB Carbon nanotube-encapsulated nickel selenide composite nanostructures were used as nonenzymatic electrochemical sensors for dopamine detection. These composite nanostructures were synthesized through a simple, one-step, and environmentally friendly chemical vapor deposition method, wherein the CNTs were formed in situ from pyrolysis of a carbon-rich metallo-organic precursor. The composition and morphology of these hybrid NiSe2-filled carbon nanostructures were confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction, Raman, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy images. Electrochemical tests demonstrated that the as-synthesized hybrid nanostructures exhibited outstanding electrocatalytic performance toward dopamine oxidation, with a high sensitivity of 19.62 mu A mu M-1 cm(-2), low detection limit, broad linear range of 5 nM-640 mu M, and high selectivity. The synergistic effects of enhanced electrochemical activity of nickel selenide along with the enhanced conductivity of carbon nanotubes led to the high electrocatalytic efficiency for these nanostructured composites. The high sensitivity and selectivity of this nanostructured composite could be exploited to develop simple, selective, and sensitive electrochemical sensors to detect and quantify dopamine in human tear samples with high reliability. This nanotube-encapsulated sensor, hence, paves the way for discoveries in the development of dopamine sensors with low cost and high stability, which can be used for noninvasive dopamine detection in peripheral bodily fluids.

AB The thermal oligomerization of ethylene is an intriguing reaction for the production of fuel-range products. Often viewed as a detrimental reaction leading to polymeric deposits in pipelines, recent work suggests that it can be exploited to convert ethylene to higher hydrocarbons in the C5-C12 range. Despite the long history surrounding this reaction, quantum chemical simulations have not been fully deployed to provide full mechanistic understanding, and kinetic models to optimize reaction conditions are lacking. In this work, a microkinetic model based on quantum chemical calculations was developed to unravel the primary drivers of initiation and understand the formation of a variety of products of different carbon number, including odd-numbered products. Through flux analysis, the main driver of initiation was identified to be hydrogen abstraction from ethylene by a 1,4-butyl diradical produced from the reaction of two ethylene molecules. As conversion increased, the primary initiation mode switched to hydrogen abstraction by a butene diradical as 1-butene began to be produced in high quantities. Odd-numbered carbon species were seen to originate from the beta-scission of C8 radical species, with the radical position varied due to intramolecular hydrogen shift reactions from terminal radicals formed via radical addition reactions. The significant quantity of linear terminal olefins in the experimental product distribution was identified to originate from the formation of vinyl radicals through hydrogen abstraction reactions involving ethylene that were then propagated via radical addition reactions to ethylene. The insights from this work can aid in the development of intensified reactor systems to valorize ethane streams from shale gas production, converting waste streams directly to usable fuel products.
   Microkinetic model quantitatively captures conditions under which thermal oligomerization of ethylene leads to broad product distribution of linear alkenes with both even and odd carbon numbers.

AB This paper proposes a novel simulation-based hybrid approach coupled with time-dependent Bayesian network analysis to model multi-infrastructure vulnerability over time under physical, spatial, and informational uncertainties while considering cascading failures within and across infrastructure networks. Unlike existing studies that unrealistically assume that infrastructure managers have full knowledge of all the infrastructure systems, the proposed approach considers a realistic scenario where complete information about the infrastructure network topology or the supply-demand flow characteristics is not available while estimating multi-infrastructure vulnerability. A novel heuristic algorithm is proposed to construct a dynamic fault tree to abstract the network topology of any infrastructure. In addition, to account for the unavailability of exact supply-demand flow characteristics, the proposed approach constructs the interdependence links across infrastructure network systems using different simulated parameters considering the physical, logical, and geographical dependencies. Finally, using parameters for geographical proximity, infrastructure managers' risk perception, and the relative importance of one infrastructure on another, the multi-infrastructure vulnerability over time is estimated. Results from the numerical experiment show that for an opportunistic risk perception, the interdependencies attribute to redundancies, and with an increase in redundancy, the vulnerability decreases. On the other hand, from a conservative risk perspective, the interdependencies attribute to deficiencies/liabilities, and the vulnerability increases with an increase in the number of such interdependencies.

AB Glacial retreat due to global warming is exposing large tracts of barren glacial sediments that are quickly colonized by CO2-fixing microbial communities that can constitute the climax community in many high-Arctic, alpine, and Antarctic environments. Despite the potential importance of these processes, little is known about microbial community successional dynamics and rates of carbon (C) sequestration in environments where higher plants are slow or unable to establish. We analyzed microbial community succession and C and N accumulation in newly exposed sediments along an Antarctic glacial chronosequence where moss and microbial autotrophs are the dominant primary producers. During the first 4 years of succession (0 to 40 m from the glacier) algae (including diatoms) were the most relatively abundant eukaryotes, but by the second phase studied (8 to 12 years) moss amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) dominated. The rise in moss coincided with a significant buildup of C and N in the sediments. The final two phases of the successional sequence (16 to 20 and 26 to 30 years) were marked by declines in microbial species richness and moss relative abundance, that coincided with significant decreases in both total C and N. These retrogressive declines coincided with a large increase in relative abundance of predatory Vampyrellidae suggesting a possible mechanism for retrogression in this and perhaps other terrestrial ecosystems at the edge of the cryosphere. These findings have implications for understanding CO2 sequestration and ecosystem succession in microbial-dominated regions of the cryobiosphere where large tracts of land are currently undergoing deglaciation.

AB The potential-dependent negative fractional reaction orders with respect to the CO partial pressures were measured for CO2 electroreduction (CO2R) on Au under mass-transfer-controlled conditions using a rotating ring-disk electrode setup. At high overpotentials, the CO reaction order approaches -1 due to enhanced CO adsorption on Au, which is supported by kinetic analysis and density functional theory (DFT) simulations. This work illustrates that the CO site-blocking effect cannot be ignored, even on a weak CO-binding metal such as Au in the electrochemical environment. The CO site-blocking effect can greatly hamper the activity and the selectivity of the CO2R to CO. This observation enriches the current mechanistic understanding of the CO2R and could have significant implications not only in the theoretical modeling of the CO2R but also in the evaluation of intrinsic CO2R activity at practical current density and high conversion conditions.

AB Introduction Student parents, both undergraduate and graduate, face the difficult task of balancing their studies and raising children, and they are a population often neglected or forgotten by higher education administration. The COVID-19 pandemic enhanced already present issues student parents face through the implementation of virtual schooling, increased daycare costs and closings, staying home with sick children, and a lack of local support system, among others. Further, many student parents are graduate students who are performing research that requires physical campus space and equipment to fulfill their educational requirements, and their research progress come to a halt when the country locked down.Methods This study explored the struggles student parents faced prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, what issues the pandemic exacerbated, and what new problems have since arisen. Participants completed surveys assessing the consequences of being a student parent during the pandemic, coping resources available to them, the effect of being a student parent during the pandemic on their mental health, and demographic information.Results Prevalent themes include substantial declines in mental health, feelings of inadequacy in regards to both their parenting and academic abilities compared to their non-student parent peers, and a striking lack of resources or acknowledgement from their institution.Discussion The survey results are framed within the social-ecological model to better understand the systemic implications of student parent conditions. Finally, we formulate a set of recommendations to higher education administrations to inform them about the unique struggles student parents face and suggest strategies for mitigation.

AB Compute Express Link (CXL) is a promising technology providing connectivity between host processors and peripheral devices like accelerators or memory modules. Compute nodes are usually connected through a high-speed network like Ethernet or Infiniband. CXL provides another way for connectivity by having compute nodes connected through CXL switches. CXL devices can connect to the switches, granting resource pooling and sharing across nodes. Access latency to CXL memory is similar to 10x smaller than access to the memory of another node through network operations. This enables a more efficient way to communicate between nodes. Currently, no existing Message Passing Interface (MPI) libraries utilize CXL for inter-node communication. In this paper, we propose the usage of CXL memory devices to enhance message-passing communication across nodes. To demonstrate the benefit of CXL, we extend OSU Micro-Benchmark (OMB), a well-known MPI benchmark suite, to evaluate point-to-point communication going over CXL; the extended OMB is named OMB-CXL. As CXL technology is evolving and still under development, the availability of a CXL system with switches and memory devices is limited. We describe how to set up an emulated CXL system using QEMU, a virtualization software, for early experience. The experimental results show that communication over CXL is 15x better for small messages and 4x for larger ones in latency and bandwidth than over the network on average.

AB Electron attachment to pyridine results in electronic resonances, metastable states that can decay through electronic or nuclear degrees of freedom. This study uses orbital stabilization techniques combined with bound electronic structure methods, based on equation of motion coupled cluster or multi-reference methods, to calculate positions and widths of electronic resonances in pyridine that exist below 10 eV. We report four B-2(1) and four (2)A(2) resonances, including one B-2(1) not previously reported experimentally and two (2)A(2) resonances not reported at all in the literature. The two lower energy resonances are one-particle shape resonances, while the remaining are mixed or primarily core-excited resonances. Multi-reference perturbation theory provides the best description of these resonances, especially when their character is mixed. We describe the character of these resonances qualitatively and calculate Dyson orbitals, which provide information about their decay channels.

AB The photoATRP of methyl acrylate (MA) is investigated using riboflavin (RF) and CuBr2/Me6TREN as a dual catalyst system under green LED irradiation (lambda approximate to 525 nm). Both RF and CuBr2/Me6TREN enhanced oxygen tolerance, enabling effective ATRP in the presence of residual oxygen. High molar mass polymers (up to Mn approximate to 129 000 g<middle dot>mol-1) with low dispersity (& Dstrok; <= 1.16) are prepared, and chain-end fidelity is confirmed through successful chain extension. The molecular masses of the obtained polymer increased linearly with conversion and showed high initiation efficiency. Mechanistic studies by laser flash photolysis reveal that the predominant activator generation mechanism is reductive quenching of RF by Me6TREN (83%, under [CuBr2]/[Me6TREN] = 1/3 condition), supported by polymerization kinetics and thermodynamic calculations.
   PhotoATRP of methyl acrylate with riboflavin (RF) and CuBr2/Me6TREN as a dual catalytic system is successfully carried out under a green LED light. The process demonstrated high chain-end fidelity, efficient oxygen tolerance, and controlled polymerization kinetics, driven primarily by reductive quenching of RF. It offers a sustainable approach to well-defined polymers. image

AB The separation of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) comonomers produced from the chemical recycling and depolymerization of PET is a critical step in realizing polyester material circularity. Various grades of PET (e.g., fiber, bottle, tire-cord) each require precise degrees of crystallinity which is controlled by the introduction of isomeric phthalates, comonomers which then contaminate secondary monomer streams. The use of supramolecular interactions as a method of extracting and separating these comonomers is herein described. The binding constants (Kb) between various-sized cyclodextrins with dimethyl terephthalate/dimethyl isophthalate and bis-2-hydroxyethyl terephthalate/bis-2-hydroxyethyl isophthalate are measured by fluorescence quenching and titration measurements. It is shown that beta-cyclodextrins most favorably bind the monomers (Kb up to 830 M-1) and that methyl ester comonomers bind more strongly than the glycolysis products. Competitive binding measurements between isomeric aromatic esters indicate alpha cyclodextrin binds dimethyl terephthalate (Kb = 328 M-1) 6-times more strongly than the dimethyl isophthalate isomer (Kb = 55 M-1). Crosslinking of the cyclodextrins with diisocyanate or perfluorinated bis-cyanobenzene moieties resulted in particles that could effectively remove the monomers from depolymerization solutions (up to 0.6 mmol of monomer per gram of particle). The results suggest supramolecular extraction and separation may be a scalable means of improving the purity and atom recovery of secondary recycled polyester feedstocks.
   The separation and recovery of PET monomers from chemical recycling is demonstrated with the use of supramolecular binding.

AB In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has reshaped various facets of our day-to-day lives. To evaluate both hardware and software deployment of Machine Learning (ML) applications, it is necessary to measure system-wide performance and accuracy. MLPerf, a Machine Learning Benchmark from MLCommons, provides a standard for measuring Machine Learning Performance on hardware. To our knowledge, there is little known public effort on porting and optimizing these inference benchmark models on AMD GPUs. This paper focuses on the effort to port MLPerf BERT, one of the MLPerf Inference Benchmarks, to run on AMD Instinct MI210 and MI250 Accelerators. We describe the challenges encountered, solutions applied, and the successful porting of the benchmark resulting in submission of the code to the MLPerf community codebase. This paper derives from unpublished work completed as part of the 2023 Student Cluster Competition (SCC23). We present the first unofficial results for running the MLPerf BERT Inference Benchmark using our optimization strategies on AMD accelerators, specifically the MI250 and MI210. Additionally, as a result of this effort, the CM Automation framework now supports AMD ROCm for PyTorch and ONNX Runtime platforms.

AB Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed to compute the lattice constants, formation energies and vacancy formation energies of transition metal nitrides (TMNs) for transition metals (TM) ranging from 3d-5d series. The results obtained using six different DFT exchange and correlation potentials (LDA, AM05, BLYP, PBE, rPBE, and PBEsol) show that the experimental lattice constants are best predicted by rPBE, while the values obtained using AM05, PBE, rPBE and PBEsol lie between the LDA and BLYP calculated values. A linear relationship is observed between the lattice constants and formation energies with the mean radii of TM and the difference in the electronegativity of TM and N in TMNs, respectively. Our calculated vacancy formation energies, in general, show that N-vacancies are more favorable than TM-vacancies in most TMNs. We observe that N-vacancy formation energies are linearly correlated with the calculated bulk formation energies indicating that TMNs with large negative formation energies are less susceptible to the formation of N-vacancies. Thus, our results from this extensive DFT study not only provide a systematic comparison of various DFT functionals in calculating the properties of TMNs but also serve as reference data for the computation-driven experimental design of materials.

AB Modulation in the temporal pattern of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), such as Pulse width modulated (PWM), has been considered a new dimension in pain and neurorehabilitation therapy. Recently, the potentials of PWM TENS have been studied on sensory profiles and corticospinal activity. However, the underlying mechanism of PWM TENS on cortical network which might lead to pain alleviation is not yet investigated. Therefore, we recorded cortical activity using electroencephalography (EEG) from 12 healthy subjects and assessed the alternation of the functional connectivity at the cortex level up to an hour following the PWM TENS and compared that with the effect of conventional TENS. The connectivity between eight brain regions involved in sensory and pain processing was calculated based on phase lag index and spearman correlation. The alteration in segregation and integration of information in the network were investigated using graph theory. The proposed analysis discovered several statistically significant network changes between PWM TENS and conventional TENS, such as increased local strength and efficiency of the network in high gamma-band in primary and secondary somatosensory sources one hour following stimulation. Our findings regarding the long-lasting desired effects of PWM TENS support its potential as a therapeutic intervention in clinical research.

AB Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are highly regarded as leading contenders to traditional lithium-ion batteries owing to their impressive energy density and low cost. Unfortunately, the serious issues such as shuttle effect of polysulfides and lithium dendrite growth hinder the practical application of Li-S batteries. Our previous investigation has demonstrated that natural protein exhibits considerable capability in improving of Li-S battery performance. Herein, zein (corn protein) and polyvinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene (PVDF) are combined to create an interpenetrating structure (zein@PVDF) that works as an interlayer on a commercial separator. The results indicate that the zein@PVDF interlayer effectively enhances thermal stability, wettability, and polysulfide-trapping capability of the separator. Consequently, Li-S batteries equipped with the zein@PVDF-modified separator exhibit enhanced rate performance and extended cycle life. In particular, after 500 cycles, the battery with zein@PVDF-modified separator demonstrates a higher capacity retention rate (similar to 450 mAh g(-1), similar to 62 %) in comparison with that of Li-S cells with the commercial separator (similar to 150 mAh g(-1), 16 %). This work provides a new pathway in the design of effective modifications of the separator for improving of performance Li-S batteries.

AB Projected changes in atmospheric blocking and associated extreme weather are marked by considerable uncertainties. While paleoclimate records could help reduce these uncertainties, their low temporal resolution makes extracting synoptic-scale signals challenging. Here, a deep learning model is developed to infer summertime blocking frequency from tree-ring-based gridded reconstructions of Northern Hemisphere surface temperature over the Last Millennium. The model, despite not directly incorporating paleoclimate proxies or their locations, is implicitly constrained by them. The reconstructions highlight the tropical Pacific's strong influence on blocking variability at interannual-to-centennial time scales. A weakened tropical Pacific zonal temperature gradient during the Little Ice Age correlates with a hemispherically reduced -yet more variable interannually- blocking frequency and altered regional patterns. This deep learning approach offers a pathway for extracting paleoweather signals from paleoclimate records that enables improved understanding of blocking response to external forcing and constraining of model projections of blocking under climate change scenarios.
   The tropical Pacific's weakened zonal temperature gradient during the Little Ice Age significantly impacted blocking variability, resulting in reduced blocking frequency and altered regional patterns, according to a deep learning model for extracting paleoweather signals from paleoclimate records in the Northern Hemisphere.

AB College science courses continue to transition from traditional lecture to active learning, which has been shown to have both alleviating and exacerbating effects on undergraduate mental health. Notably, existing studies have primarily examined the relationship between active learning and anxiety, and no studies have specifically assessed the relationship between active learning and depression. To address this gap, we conducted hourlong exploratory interviews with 29 undergraduates from six institutions who identify as having depression and who had been enrolled in at least one active-learning college science course. We probed how undergraduates' depression affects their experiences in active learning, and in turn, what aspects of active-learning practices exacerbate or alleviate students' depressive symptoms. Students described that their depression negatively impacted their cognitive domains, which could make learning and social interactions challenging. Additionally, we found that the underlying aspects of active-learning practices that impact students' depression fall into four overarching categories: opportunities to compare oneself with others, socializing with others while learning, frequent formative evaluation, and engagement in learning. Each of these aspects of active learning could alleviate and/ or exacerbate depressive symptoms. This work supports recommendations to create more inclusive active-learning courses for students with depression.

ID PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS; GENE; DATABASE; BIOLOGY
AB Comparative genomics approaches seek to associate molecular evolution with the evolution of phenotypes across a phylogeny. Many of these methods lack the ability to analyze non-ordinal categorical traits with more than two categories. To address this limitation, we introduce an expansion to RERconverge that associates shifts in evolutionary rates with the convergent evolution of categorical traits. The categorical RERconverge expansion includes methods for performing categorical ancestral state reconstruction, statistical tests for associating relative evolutionary rates with categorical variables, and a new method for performing phylogeny-aware permutations, "permulations", on categorical traits. We demonstrate our new method on a three-category diet phenotype, and we compare its performance to binary RERconverge analyses and two existing methods for comparative genomic analyses of categorical traits: phylogenetic simulations and a phylogenetic signal based method. We present an analysis of how the categorical permulations scale with the number of species and the number of categories included in the analysis. Our results show that our new categorical method outperforms phylogenetic simulations at identifying genes and enriched pathways significantly associated with the diet phenotypes and that the categorical ancestral state reconstruction drives an improvement in our ability to capture diet-related enriched pathways compared to binary RERconverge when implemented without user input on phenotype evolution. The categorical expansion to RERconverge will provide a strong foundation for applying the comparative method to categorical traits on larger data sets with more species and more complex trait evolution than have previously been analyzed.

AB Anthropogenic climate change has increased the frequency and intensity of marine heatwaves that may broadly impact the health of marine invertebrates. Rising ocean temperatures lead to increases in disease prevalence in marine organisms; it is therefore critical to understand how marine heatwaves impact immune system development. The purple sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) is an ecologically important, broadcast-spawning, omnivore that primarily inhabits kelp forests in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The S. purpuratus life cycle includes a relatively long-lived (similar to 2 months) planktotrophic larval stage. Larvae have a well-characterized cellular immune system that is mediated, in part, by a subset of mesenchymal cells known as pigment cells. To assess the role of environmental temperature on the development of larval immune cells, embryos were generated from adult sea urchins conditioned at 14 degrees C. Embryos were then cultured in either ambient (14 degrees C) or elevated (18 degrees C) seawater. Results indicate that larvae raised in an elevated temperature were slightly larger and had more pigment cells than those raised at ambient temperature. Further, the larval phenotypes varied significantly among genetic crosses, which highlights the importance of genotype in structuring how the immune system develops in the context of the environment. Overall, these results indicate that larvae are phenotypically plastic in modulating their immune cells and body length in response to adverse developmental conditions.

AB Creativity has long been thought to involve associative processes in memory: connecting concepts to form ideas, inventions, and artworks. However, associa-tive thinking has been difficult to study due to limitations in modeling memory structure and retrieval processes. Recent advances in computational models of semantic memory allow researchers to examine how people navigate a se-mantic space of concepts when forming associations, revealing key search strat-egies associated with creativity. Here, we synthesize cognitive, computational, and neuroscience research on creativity and associative thinking. This Review highlights distinctions between free-and goal-directed association, illustrates the role of associative thinking in the arts, and links associative thinking to brain systems supporting both semantic and episodic memory - offering a new perspective on a longstanding creativity theory.

AB Most passive droplet transport strategies rely on spatial variations of material properties to drive droplet motion, leading to gradient-based mechanisms with intrinsic length scales that limit the droplet velocity or the transport distance. Here, we propose droplet fibrotaxis, a novel mechanism that leverages an anisotropic fiber-reinforced deformable solid to achieve spontaneous and gradient-free droplet transport. Using high-fidelity simulations, we identify the fluid wettability, fiber orientation, anisotropy strength and elastocapillary number as critical parameters that enable controllable droplet velocity and long-range droplet transport. Our results highlight the potential of fibrotaxis as a droplet transport mechanism that can have a strong impact on self-cleaning surfaces, water harvesting and medical diagnostics.

AB Sports media outlets often report on whether professional teams have clinched a playoff berth or, conversely, have been eliminated from one. Although the U.S. media have reported such results for years, particularly for Major League Baseball, no such equivalent outlets backed by rigorous mathematical models exist in South Korea. Motivated by the hiatus in most international professional sports (with a notable exception being Korean baseball) during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, we derive inspiration for the generation of so-called magic numbers by modifying an existing set of integerprogramming optimization models that had been developed for U.S. Major League Baseball; the modifications tailor these models to the Korean Baseball Organization League by considering unique rules such as the fact that a game can end in a draw. Our results, which are new to Korean media, have generated interest among Korean baseball fans curious about up-todate, precise information regarding whether their team still has a chance of qualifying for postseason play or whether they have been eliminated.

AB In drug discovery, it is vital to confirm the predictions of pharmaceutical properties from computational models using costly wet-lab experiments. Hence, obtaining reliable uncertainty estimates is crucial for prioritizing drug molecules for subsequent experimental validation. Conformal Prediction (CP) is a promising tool for creating such prediction sets for molecular properties with a coverage guarantee. However, the exchangeability assumption of CP is often challenged with covariate shift in drug discovery tasks: Most datasets contain limited labeled data, which may not be representative of the vast chemical space from which molecules are drawn. To address this limitation, we propose a method called CoDrug that employs an energy-based model leveraging both training data and unlabelled data, and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to assess the densities of a molecule set. The estimated densities are then used to weigh the molecule samples while building prediction sets and rectifying for distribution shift. In extensive experiments involving realistic distribution drifts in various small-molecule drug discovery tasks, we demonstrate the ability of CoDrug to provide valid prediction sets and its utility in addressing the distribution shift arising from de novo drug design models. On average, using CoDrug can reduce the coverage gap by over 35% when compared to conformal prediction sets not adjusted for covariate shift.

TI Strain rate controls alignment in growing bacterial monolayers
SO SOFT MATTER

DT Article
ID TOPOLOGICAL DEFECTS; DYNAMICS; ORDER
AB Growing monolayers of rod-shaped bacteria exhibit local alignment similarly to extensile active nematics. When confined in a channel or growing inward from a ring, the local nematic order of these monolayers changes to a global ordering with cells throughout the monolayer orienting in the same direction. The mechanism behind this phenomenon is so far unclear, as previously proposed mechanisms fail to predict the correct alignment direction in one or more confinement geometries. We present a strain-based model relating net deformation of the growing monolayer to the cell-level deformation resulting from single-cell growth and rotation, producing predictions of cell orientation behavior based on the velocity field in the monolayer. This model correctly predicts the direction of preferential alignment in channel-confined, inward growing, and unconfined colonies. The model also quantitatively predicts orientational order when the velocity field has no net negative strain rate in any direction. We further test our model in simulations of expanding colonies confined to spherical surfaces. Our model and simulations agree that cells away from the origin cell orient radially relative to the colony's center. Additionally, our model's quantitative prediction of the orientational order agrees with the simulation results in the top half of the sphere but fails in the lower half where there is a net negative strain rate. The success of our model bridges the gap between previous works on cell alignment in disparate confinement geometries and provides insight into the underlying physical effects responsible for large-scale alignment.

AB Many physical and chemical processes in a condensed phase environment exhibit non-Markovian quantum dynamics. As such simulations are challenging on classical computers, we developed a variational quantum algorithm that is capable of simulating non-Markovian dynamics on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. We used a quantum system linearly coupled to its harmonic bath as the model Hamiltonian. The non-Markovianity is captured by introducing auxiliary variables from the bath trajectories. With Monte Carlo sampling of the bath degrees of freedom, finite temperature dynamics is produced. We validated the algorithm on a simulator and demonstrated its performance on an IBM quantum device. The framework developed naturally adapts to any anharmonic bath with non-linear coupling to the system, and is also well suited for simulating spin chain dynamics in a dissipative environment.
   A variational quantum algorithm is developed for non-Markovian quantum dynamics simulations on a NISQ device.

AB Herein we report a method to convert primary amines, ubiquitous motifs found in pharmaceutical libraries, to either imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines or 7-alkyl azaindoles in two steps from known compounds. Using halomucononitrile reagents, we can directly access 5-bromo-6-imino-1-alkyl-1,6-dihydropyridine-2-carbonitriles (pyridinimines) in a single step from primary amines (25-93% yield) through the cyclization of transient aminomucononitrile intermediates. We then demonstrate that these compounds can be readily converted to 7-alkylazaindoles using Sonogashira cross-coupling conditions (13 examples, up to 91% yield). Under oxidative conditions, the pyridinimines serve as directing groups for C-H functionalization reactions to afford imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines. We also studied the mechanism of the cyclization event using DFT calculations and propose that this takes place via sequential base-mediated E/Z isomerization and cyclization steps.

AB Many complex crystals show a flat or even increasing lattice thermal conductivity at high temperatures, which deviates from the traditional 1/T decay trend given by conventional phonon theory. In this paper, we predict the thermal conductivity of Al2O3 that matches with experimental data from room temperature to near melting point (2200 K). The lattice thermal conductivity is found to be composed of contributions of phonon, diffuson, and radiation. Phonon particle thermal conductivity decays approximately as similar to T -1 center dot 14 after considering four-phonon (4ph) scattering as well as finite-temperature corrections to the lattice constant and harmonic and anharmonic force constants (AFCs). Diffuson (interband tunneling) thermal conductivity increases roughly as similar to T 0 center dot 43. Radiation thermal conductivity increases as similar to T 2 center dot 51, being slightly smaller than similar to T 3 due to the increase of phonon linewidth with temperature, which increases photon extinction coefficient and reduces photon mean free path (MFP). At room temperature, phonon, diffuson, and radiation contribute similar to 99, 1, and 0%, respectively. At 2200 K, their contributions change to 61, 20, and 19%, respectively. 4ph scattering is important at ultrahigh temperatures, decreasing the phonon thermal conductivity by a maximum of 24%. The finite-temperature softening effects of the harmonic and AFCs increase the phonon thermal conductivity by a maximum of 36% at ultrahigh temperatures. We also verify that Green-Kubo molecular dynamics can capture both the particle and wave nature of phonons, like the Wigner formalism. At ultrahigh temperatures, the photon MFP is found to be on the order of 100 nm, which should be considered for experimental measurement of thin films. In this paper, we aim to enhance the understanding of lattice thermal conductivity in complex crystals at ultrahigh temperatures, potentially spurring further exploration of materials suitable for such extreme conditions.

TI A mathematical model of visceral leishmaniasis transmission and control:
   Impact of ITNs on VL prevention and elimination in the Indian
   subcontinent
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID VACCINATION; INFECTION
AB Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) is a deadly, vector-borne, parasitic, neglected tropical disease, particularly prevalent on the Indian subcontinent. Sleeping under the long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) was considered an effective VL prevention and control measures, until KalaNet, a large trial in Nepal and India, did not show enough supporting evidence. In this paper, we adapt a biologically accurate, yet relatively simple compartmental ordinary differential equations (ODE) model of VL transmission and explicitly model the use of ITNs and their role in VL prevention and elimination. We also include a game-theoretic analysis in order to determine an optimal use of ITNs from the individuals' perspective. In agreement with the previous more detailed and complex model, we show that the ITNs coverage amongst the susceptible population has to be unrealistically high (over 96%) in order for VL to be eliminated. However, we also show that if the whole population, including symptomatic and asymptomatic VL cases adopt about 90% ITN usage, then VL can be eliminated. Our model also suggests that ITN usage should be accompanied with other interventions such as vector control.

TI Subtle signals: Video-based detection of infant non-nutritive sucking as
   a neurodevelopmental cue
SO COMPUTER VISION AND IMAGE UNDERSTANDING
LA English
DT Article
DE Infant development; Non-nutritive sucking; Optical flow; Vision-based
   algorithms
AB Non-nutritive sucking (NNS), which refers to the act of sucking on a pacifier, finger, or similar object without nutrient intake, plays a crucial role in assessing healthy early development. In the case of preterm infants, NNS behavior is a key component in determining their readiness for feeding. In older infants, the characteristics of NNS behavior offer valuable insights into neural and motor development. Additionally, NNS activity has been proposed as a potential safeguard against sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). However, the clinical application of NNS assessment is currently hindered by labor-intensive and subjective finger-in-mouth evaluations. Consequently, researchers often resort to expensive pressure transducers for objective NNS signal measurement. To enhance the accessibility and reliability of NNS signal monitoring for both clinicians and researchers, we introduce a vision-based algorithm designed for non-contact detection of NNS activity using baby monitor footage in natural settings. Our approach involves a comprehensive exploration of optical flow and temporal convolutional networks, enabling the detection and amplification of subtle infant-sucking signals. We successfully classify short video clips of uniform length into NNS and non-NNS periods. Furthermore, we investigate manual and learning-based techniques to piece together local classification results, facilitating the segmentation of longer mixed-activity videos into NNS and non-NNS segments of varying duration. Our research introduces two novel datasets of annotated infant videos, including one sourced from our clinical study featuring 18 infant subjects and 183 h of overnight baby monitor footage. Additionally, we incorporate a second, shorter dataset obtained from publicly available YouTube videos. Our NNS action recognition algorithm achieves an impressive 95.8% accuracy in binary classification, based on 960 2.5-s balanced NNS versus nonNNS clips from our clinical dataset. We also present results for a subset of clips featuring challenging video conditions. Moreover, our NNS action segmentation algorithm achieves an average precision of 93.5% and an average recall of 92.9% across 30 heterogeneous 60-s clips from our clinical dataset.

AB During his time at Royal Institute of Technology (Kungliga Tekniska h & ouml;gskolan) in Sweden, the present author learned nonequilibrium thermodynamics from Mats Hillert. The key concepts are the separation of internal and external variables of a system and the definitions of potentials and molar quantities. In equilibrium thermodynamics derived by Gibbs, the internal variables are not independent and can be fully evaluated from given external variables. While irreversible thermodynamics led by Onsager focuses on internal variables though often mixed with external variables. Hillert integrated them together by first emphasizing their differences and then examining their connections. His philosophy was reflected by the title of his book "Phase Equilibria, Phase Diagrams and Phase Transformations" that puts equilibrium, nonequilibrium, and internal processes on equal footing. In the present paper honoring Hillert, the present author reflects his experiences with Hillert and his work in last 40 years and expresses his gratitude for all the wisdom and support from him in terms of "Hillert nonequilibrium thermodynamics" and discusses some recent topics that the present author has been working on.

AB The texture of meat is one of the most important features to mimic when developing meat analogs. Both protein source and processing method impact the texture of the final product. We can distinguish three types of mechanical tests to quantify the textural differences between meat and meat analogs: puncture type, rheological torsion tests, and classical mechanical tests of tension, compression, and bending. Here, we compile the shear force and stiffness values of whole and comminuted meats and meat analogs from the two most popular tests for meat, the Warner-Bratzler shear test and the double-compression texture profile analysis. Our results suggest that, with the right fine-tuning, today's meat analogs are well capable of mimicking the mechanics of real meat. While Warner-Bratzler shear tests and texture profile analysis provide valuable information about the tenderness and sensory perception of meat, both tests suffer from a lack of standardization, which limits cross-study comparisons. Here, we provide guidelines to standardize meat testing and report meat stiffness as the single most informative mechanical parameter. Collecting big standardized data and sharing them with the community at large could empower researchers to harness the power of generative artificial intelligence to inform the systematic development of meat analogs with desired mechanical properties and functions, taste, and sensory perception.

AB Electrolysis of bicarbonate-containing CO2 capture solutions is a promising approach towards achieving low-cost carbon-neutral chemicals production. However, the parasitic bicarbonate-mediated hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and electrode instability in the presence of trace impurities remain major obstacles to overcome. This work demonstrates that the combined use of titanium dioxide (TiO2) overlayers with the chelating agent ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) significantly enhances the selectivity and stability of Ag-based electrocatalysts for bicarbonate electrolysis. The amorphous TiO2 overlayers suppress the HER by over 50 % at potentials more negative than -0.7 V vs. RHE, increasing the CO faradaic efficiency (FE) by 33 % (relative). In situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) measurements reveal the absence of near-surface bicarbonate species and an abundance of CO2 reduction intermediates at the Ag|TiO2 buried interface, suggesting that the overlayers suppress HER by blocking bicarbonate ions from reaching the buried active sites. In accelerated degradation tests with 5 ppm of Fe(III) impurity, the addition of EDTA allows stable CO production with >47 % FE, while the electrodes rapidly deactivate in the absence of EDTA. This work highlights the use of TiO2 overlayers for enhancing the CO : H2 ratio while simultaneously protecting electrocatalysts from impurities likely to be present in "open" carbon capture systems.

AB Owing to the dramatic increase in IT power density and energy consumption, the data center (DC) sector has started adopting thermally-and energy-efficient liquid cooling methods. This study examines a single-phase direct-to-chip liquid cooling approach for three high-heat-density racks, utilizing two liquid-to-air (L2A) cooled coolant distribution units (CDUs) and a combined total heat load of 128 kW. An experimental setup was developed to test different types of CDUs, cooling loops, and thermal testing vehicles (TTVs) for different operating conditions. IR images and the collected data were used to investigate the effect of air recirculation between cold and hot aisle containments on the CDU's performance and stability of supply air temperature (SAT). Three different types of cooling loops (X, Y, and Z) were characterized thermally and hydraulically. Results show that Type Y has the lowest cold plate thermal resistance and pressure drop, among others. In a later test that included a single rack at a heat load of 53 kW and a single CDU, the heat capture ratio for fluid was found to be 94%. Experiments show that using blanking panels on the back of the racks limits hot air recircu-lation and maintains a steady SAT in the cold aisle. Finally, the CDU performance was evaluated at a high heat load for the three racks at 128 kW, and the average cooling capacity of the units is 58.6 kW, and the effectiveness values for CDU 1 and CDU 2 are 0.83 and 0.82, respectively.

AB Motion graphics videos are widely used in Web design, digital advertising, animated logos and film title sequences, to capture a viewer's attention. But editing such video is challenging because the video provides a low-level sequence of pixels and frames rather than higher-level structure such as the objects in the video with their corresponding motions and occlusions. We present a motion vectorization pipeline for converting motion graphics video into an SVG motion program that provides such structure. The resulting SVG program can be rendered using any SVG renderer (e.g. most Web browsers) and edited using any SVG editor. We also introduce a program transformation API that facilitates editing of a SVG motion program to create variations that adjust the timing, motions and/or appearances of objects. We show how the API can be used to create a variety of effects including retiming object motion to match a music beat, adding motion textures to objects, and collision preserving appearance changes.

AB The open circuit potential (OCP) of a semiconductor electrode can be used to quantify the transient photopotential (E-p), which represents wavelength-dependent charge accumulation and relaxation kinetics of a photoelectrode. Here OCP responses of a plasmonic Au@TiO2 nanorods (NRs) photoelectrode can be quantified without causing electrochemical corrosion of Au. The photogenerated charge accumulation kinetics data based on the wavelength-dependent growth rates of |E-p| can resolve the plasmonic effects on photoelectrochemistry (PEC) of Au@TiO2 NRs. Data fitting with Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts (KWW) stretched exponential kinetics model illustrates the complex charge relaxations at the Au/TiO2 Schottky contact, from which long relaxation lifetimes with broad lifetime distributions can be obtained. This is attributed to the abundant deep defects in the nanostructure TiO2, which has been strongly confirmed by reducing the oxygen vacancies using a post-thermal annealing treatment. Single-particle dark-field scattering (DFS) spectrum is measured with a tunable wavelength light source to support visible light activities of PEC characteristics of Au@TiO2 NRs. Light scattering spectra of >200 single Au@TiO2 NRs particles are collected to compare directly with PEC responses of OCP of the ensemble Au@TiO2 NRs.

ID X-RAY-EMISSION; ABSOLUTE-CONFIGURATION; DYNAMICS; IONIZATION; H-3(+)
AB Fragmentation dynamics in the Coulomb explosion of hydrocarbons, specifically methane, ethane, propane, and butane, are investigated using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) simulations. The goal of this work is to elucidate the distribution of fragments generated under laser-driven Coulomb explosion conditions. Detailed analysis reveals the types of fragments formed, their respective charge states, and the optimal laser intensities required for achieving various fragmentations. Our results indicate distinct fragmentation patterns for each hydrocarbon, correlating with the molecular structure and ionization potential. Additionally, we identify the laser parameters that maximize fragmentation efficiency, providing valuable insights for experimental setups. This research advances our understanding of Coulomb explosion mechanisms and offers a foundation for further studies in controlled molecular fragmentation.

TI Learning Hierarchical Task Structures for Few-shot Graph Classification
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY FROM DATA
LA English
DT Article
DE Few-shot learning; graph classification; data mining; graph neural
   networks
AB The problem of few-shot graph classification targets at assigning class labels for graph samples, where only limited labeled graphs are provided for each class. To solve the problem brought by label scarcity, recent studies have proposed to adopt the prevalent few-shot learning framework to achieve fast adaptations to graph classes with limited labeled graphs. In particular, these studies typically propose to accumulate meta-knowledge across a large number of meta-training tasks, and then generalize such meta-knowledge to meta-test tasks sampled from a disjoint class set. Nevertheless, existing studies generally ignore the crucial task correlations among meta-training tasks and treat them independently. In fact, such task correlations can help promote the model generalization to meta-test tasks and result in better classification performance. On the other hand, it remains challenging to capture and utilize task correlations due to the complex components and interactions in meta-training tasks. To deal with this, we propose a novel few-shot graph classification framework FAITH to capture task correlations via learning a hierarchical task structure at different granularities. We further propose a task-specific classifier to incorporate the learned task correlations into the few-shot graph classification process. Moreover, we derive FAITH+, a variant of FAITH that can improve the sampling process for the hierarchical task structure. The extensive experiments on four prevalent graph datasets further demonstrate the superiority of FAITH and FAITH+ over other state-of-the-art baselines.

AB In this paper, we investigate the employment of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) into vehicle platoons, functioning in tandem with a base station (BS) in support of the high-precision location tracking. In particular, the use of a RIS imposes additional structured sparsity that, when paired with the initial sparse line-of-sight (LoS) channels of the BS, facilitates beneficial group sparsity. The resultant group sparsity significantly enriches the energies of the original direct-only channel, enabling a greater concentration of the LoS channel energies emanated from the same vehicle location index. Furthermore, the burst sparsity is exposed by representing the non-line-of-sight (NLoS) channels as their sparse copies. This thus constitutes the philosophy of the diverse sparsities of interest. Then, a diverse dynamic layered structured sparsity (DiLuS) framework is customized for capturing different priors for this pair of sparsities, based upon which the location tracking problem is formulated as a maximum a posterior (MAP) estimate of the location. Nevertheless, the tracking issue is highly intractable due to the ill-conditioned sensing matrix, intricately coupled latent variables associated with the BS and RIS, and the spatial-temporal correlations among the vehicle platoon. To circumvent these hurdles, we propose an efficient algorithm, namely DiLuS enabled spatial-temporal platoon localization (DiLuS-STPL), which incorporates both variational Bayesian inference (VBI) and message passing techniques for recursively achieving parameter updates in a turbo-like way. Finally, we demonstrate through extensive simulation results that the localization relying exclusively upon a BS and a RIS may achieve the comparable precision performance obtained by the two individual BSs, along with the robustness and superiority of our proposed algorithm as compared to various benchmark schemes.

ID VERIFICATION
AB We present 5GCVerif, a model-based testing framework designed to formally analyze the access control framework of the 5G Core. With its modular design, 5GCVerif employs various abstraction techniques to craft an abstract model that captures the intricate details of the 5G Core's access control mechanism. This approach offers customizability and extensibility in constructing the abstract model and addresses the state explosion problem in model checking. 5GCVerif also sidesteps the challenge of exhaustively generating models for all possible core network configurations by restricting the model checker to explore policy violations only within the valid network configurations. Using 5GCVerif, we evaluated 55 security properties, leading to the discovery of five new vulnerabilities in 5G Core's access control mechanism. The uncovered vulnerabilities can result in multiple attacks including unauthorized entry to sensitive information, illegitimate access to services, and denial-of-services.

AB Distributed energy resource aggregators (DERAs) must share the distribution network together with the distribution utility in order to participate in the wholesale electricity markets that are operated by independent system operators (ISOs). We propose a forward auction that a distribution system operator (DSO) can utilize to allocate distribution network access limits to DERAs. As long as the DERAs operate within their acquired limits, these limits define operating envelopes that guarantee distribution network security, thus defining a mechanism that requires no real-time intervention from the DSOs for DERAs to participate in the wholesale markets. Our auctions take the form of robust and risk-sensitive markets with bids/offers from DERAs and utility's operational costs. Properties of the proposed auction, e.g., resulting surpluses of DSO and the DERAs, and the auction prices, along with empirical performance studies, are presented.

AB Tri-axial tactile sensors that provide real-time information on both normal and shear forces are enabling technologies for tactile perception, which open up new possibilities in robotics, human-machine interfaces, environmental sensing, and health monitoring. Among tri-axial tactile sensors based on different mechanisms, inductive sensors possess good robustness against environmental contamination. Their low sensitivity to normal and shear loads, however, is a critical barrier. This work presents the rational design of soft inductive tri-axial tactile sensors that are capable of distinguishing static or dynamic normal and shear loads, with exceptional tactile sensitivity. Dual mechanisms of Biot-Savart law and Eddy current effect are explored to overcome the longstanding sensitivity issue. In addition, a hybrid coil with non-uniform spacing is designed to generate uniform magnetic fields, addressing the limitations of traditional uniform coils and significantly improving the sensor's tactile sensitivity. The picosecond pulsed laser scribing technique makes it possible to pattern silver nanowires into inductive coils with high fidelity. A porous compressible layer is adopted to enable adjustable sensitivity and sensing range to meet diverse application demands. Finally, the sensor is integrated between the user's leg and the orthosis, showcasing the sensor's capability for real-time monitoring of tri-axial forces and its robustness against environmental objects.

AB Recently, research on photocatalysis has become indispensable in tackling the key global environmental issues caused by rapid urbanization and industrialization. In the present work, novel Sn-doped ZnS@CuO composites were designed for visible light driven wastewater remediation and explored the optimum concentration of CuO with enhanced photocatalytic efficiency. The study aimed to tailor the optical response of the photocatalysts to utilize the visible spectrum with enhanced performance against organic pollutants. For the development of Sndoped ZnS@CuO composites, CuO flowers were prepared via a simple hydrothermal technique, whereas a chemical co-precipitation procedure was used to create Sn-doped ZnS nanoparticles (NPs). The X-ray diffraction confirmed the monoclinic phase of CuO, whilst ZnS crystallized in a wurtzite structure. The diffraction patterns of the Sn-doped ZnS@CuO composites comprised of Sn-doped ZnS and CuO co-existing phases. The crystallite sizes were determined to be in the range between 8 and 28 nm. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy further confirmed the elemental information of the photocatalysts. The FESEM images demonstrated a flower-like morphology for CuO, while Sn-doped ZnS revealed agglomeration of NPs. Furthermore, the optical response of Sn-doped ZnS@CuO composites was significantly improved towards the visible region with the addition of CuO. Particularly, the Sn-doped ZnS@CuO composites with a 75 % CuO ratio (marked as W1) revealed an outstanding methylene blue (MB) removal efficiency of 96 %. The current work suggests that the novel Sn-doped ZnS@CuO composites can be utilized for the degradation of toxic pollutants from the aquatic environment.

AB Receptor-mediated endocytosis (RME) is a highly complex process carried out by bioparticles, such as viruses and drug carriers, to enter cells. The discovery of both clathrin-dependent and clathrin-free pathways makes the RME process even more intriguing. Numerical models have been developed to facilitate the exploration of the process. However, the impacts of the receptor properties on RME have been less studied partially due to the oversimplifications of the receptor models. In this paper, we implement a stochastic model to systematically investigate the effects of mechanical (receptor flexure), geometrical (receptor length) and biochemical (ligand-receptor cutoff) properties of receptors, on RME with and without the existence of clathrin. Our simulation results show that the receptor's flexural rigidity plays an important role in RME with clathrin. There is a threshold beyond which particle internalization will not occur. Without clathrin, it is very difficult to achieve complete endocytosis with ligand-receptor interactions alone. A shorter receptor length and longer ligand-receptor reaction cutoff promote the formation of ligand-receptor bonds and facilitate particle internalization. Complete internalization can only be obtained with an extremely short receptor length and long reaction cutoff. Therefore, there are most likely some additional mechanisms to drive the membrane deformation in clathrin-free RME. Our results yield important fundamental insights into RME and provide crucial guidance when correlating the simulation results with experimental observations.

AB Structure elucidation plays a critical role across the landscape of medicinal chemistry, including medicinal inorganic chemistry. Herein, we discuss the importance of structure elucidation in drug development and then provide three vignettes that capture key instances of its relevance in the development of biologically active inorganic compounds. In the first, we describe the exploration of the biological activity of the trinuclear Ru compound called ruthenium red and the realization that this activity derived from a dinuclear impurity. We next explore the development of Au-based antitubercular and antiarthritic drugs, which features a key step whereby ligands were discovered to bind to Au through S atoms. The third exposition traces the development of As-based antiparasitic drugs, a key step of which was the realization that the reaction of arsenic acid and aniline does not produce an anilide of arsenic acid, as originally thought, but rather an amino arsonic acid. These case studies provide the motivation for an outlook in which the development of Sb-based antiparasitic drugs is described. Although antileishmanial pentavalent antimonial drugs remain in widespread use to this day, their chemical structures remain unknown.
   The importance of molecular structure elucidation in medicinal inorganic chemistry drug development is discussed and illustrated using three vignettes on Ru-, Au-, and As-based drugs. An outlook on Sb-based drugs is provided. The development of three classes of medicinal inorganic compounds is reviewed, highlighting the important role of structure elucidation. The progress of Ru-, Au-, and As-based compounds provide a justification for working to understand the structures of clinically used Sb-containing antiparasitic drugs. image

AB Interaction of three-dimensional magnetic fields, turbulence, and self-gravity in the molecular cloud is crucial in understanding star formation but has not been addressed so far. In this work, we target the low-mass star-forming region L1688 and use the spectral emissions of (CO)-C-12, (CO)-C-13, (CO)-O-18, and H I, as well as polarized dust emissions. To obtain the 3D direction of the magnetic field, we employ the novel polarization fraction analysis. In combining with the plane-of-the-sky (POS) magnetic field strength derived from the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi (DCF) method and the new differential measure analysis (DMA) technique, we present the first measurement of L1688's three-dimensional magnetic field, including its orientation and strength. We find that L1688's magnetic field has two statistically different inclination angles. The low-intensity tail has an inclination angle approximate to 55 degrees. on average, while that of the central dense clump is approximate to 30 degrees. We find the global mean value of total magnetic field strength is B-tot approximate to 135 mu G from DCF and B-tot approximate to 75 mu G from DMA. We use the velocity gradient technique (VGT) to separate the magnetic fields' POS orientation associated with L1688 and its foreground/background. The magnetic fields' orientations are statistically coherent. The probability density function of H 2 column density and VGT reveal that L1688 is potentially undergoing gravitational contraction at large scale approximate to 1.0 pc and gravitational collapse at small scale approximate to 0.2 pc. The gravitational contraction mainly along the magnetic field resulting in an approximate power-law relation B-tot alpha n(H)(1/2) H when volume density n(H) is less than approximately 6.0 x10(3) cm(-3).

AB EmrE is a bacterial efflux protein in the small multidrug-resistant (SMR) family present in Escherichia coli. Due to its small size, 110 residues in each dimer subunit, it is an ideal model system to study ligand-protein-membrane interactions. Here in our work, we have calculated the free energy landscape of benzyltrimetylammonium (BTMA) and tetraphenyl phosphonium (TPP) binding to EmrE using the enhanced sampling method-multiple walker metadynamics. We estimate that the free energy of BTMA binding to EmrE is -21.2 +/- 3.3 kJ/mol and for TPP is -43.6 +/- 3.8 kJ/mol. BTMA passes through two metastable states to reach the binding pocket, while TPP has a more complex binding landscape with four metastable states and one main binding site. Our simulations show that the ligands interact with the membrane lipids at a distance 1 nm away from the binding site which forms a broad local minimum, consistent for both BTMA and TPP. This site can be an alternate entry point for ligands to partition from the membrane into the protein, especially for bulky and/or branched ligands. We also observed the membrane lipid and C-terminal 110HisA form salt-bridge interactions with the helix-1 residue 22LysB. Our free energy estimates and clusters are in close agreement with experimental data and give us an atomistic view of the ligand-protein-lipid interactions. Understanding the binding pathway of these ligands can guide us in future design of ligands that can alter or halt the function of EmrE.

AB The energy gaps, spin-orbit coupling (SOC), and admixture coefficients over a series of the configurations are evaluated by the SA-CASSCF/6-31G, SA-CASSCF/6-31G*, SA-CASSCF/ANO-RCC-VDZP, and MS-CASPT2/ANO-RCC-VDZP to reveal the extent of the inaccuracy of the SA-CASSCF. By comparing the mean absolute errors for the energy gaps and the admixture coefficient magnitudes (ACMs) measured between the SA-CASSCF/6-31G, SA-CASSCF/6-31G*, or SA-CASSCF/ANO-RCC-VDZP and the MS-CASPT2/ANO-RCC-VDZP, the SA-CASSCF/6-31G is selected as the electronic structure method in the nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulation. The major components of the ACMs of the SA-CASSCF/6-31G and MS-CASPT2/ANO-RCC-VDZP are identified and compared; we find that the ACMs are underestimated by the SA-CASSCF/6-31G, which is verified by the reasonable triplet quantum yield simulated by the trajectory surface hopping and the calibrated SA-CASSCF/6-31G. The magnitude of the singlet-triplet mixing positively correlates to the hopping probability between the mixed singlet and triplet states, which is confirmed by the computed S-T transition probability.

TI Dependence of the asymptotic energy dissipation on third-order velocity

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW FLUIDS

ID TURBULENCE; ONSAGER; 4/5-LAW; LAW
AB The asymptotic energy dissipation is connected to the third-order scaling of the longi-tudinal velocity increment magnitude in three-dimensional turbulence via the Kolmogorov 4/5 law. It is shown that the third-order longitudinal absolute velocity increment scaling should not exceed unity for anomalous dissipation to occur, that is for nonvanishing average dissipation in the inviscid limit-also known as the "zeroth law" of turbulence. Conversely, if the third-order longitudinal absolute velocity increment scaling exceeds unity, then the average dissipation must asymptotically vanish and the velocity increment field will becomes symmetric at least at the level of its skewness. This Letter highlights the importance of the third-order absolute velocity increment scaling in assessing the status of the zeroth law of turbulence.

AB Direct imaging of single molecules at nanostructured interfaces is a grand challenge with potential to enable new, precise material architectures and technologies. Of particular interest are the structural morphology and spectroscopic signatures of the adsorbed molecule, where modern probes are only now being developed with the necessary spatial and energetic resolution to provide detailed information at the molecule-surface interface. Here, we directly characterize the adsorption of individual m-terphenyl isocyanide ligands on a reconstructed Au(111) surface through scanning tunneling microscopy and inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy. The site-dependent steric pressure of the various surface features alters the vibrational fingerprints of the m-terphenyl isocyanides, which are characterized with single-molecule precision through joint experimental and theoretical approaches. This study provides molecular-level insights into the steric-pressure-enabled surface binding selectivity as well as its effect on the chemical properties of individual surface-binding ligands.

AB Armour has been present in vertebrates for millions of years and has evolved independently several times in the ray finned fishes. While armour is typically considered defensive, it is a multifunctional trait with many plausible alternative functions. We explore the hydrodynamic function of armour in nine species of poachers (Agonidae) by visualizing flow to assess drag reduction. We used microcomputed tomography scans to categorize armour morphology into morphotypes, and compared the rugosity (surface roughness) across these morphotypes. We then used digital particle image velocimetry to visualize boundary layer separation along 3D-printed whole-body models made using the scans. Poacher armour comprises eight rows that, some distance behind the second dorsal fin, merge into six. We found four morphotypes, with higher rugosity observed for the prominent spine morphotype and the lowest rugosity in the no-spine morphotype. Principal component analysis revealed that much of the variation in armour morphology is driven by plate shape, spine size, and protrusion. The boundary layer was retained longer in species with larger spines. Overall, the presence of a spine increased boundary layer retention, decreasing the drag, which is advantageous for these benthic fish.

AB Extreme stratospheric wave activity has been linked to surface cold extremes over North America, but little is known whether the Quasi-biennial Oscillation (QBO) plays a role in this linkage. Here, by comparing strong stratospheric wave events during the westerly phase (wQBO) with those during the easterly phase (eQBO), we show that the cooling signature following strong wave events depends on the QBO phase in observations. During wQBO, strong wave events are followed by an increased risk of North American cold extremes and a vertical structure shift from a westward phase tilt to an eastward tilt. However, strong wave events under eQBO do not change the cold risk nor alter the vertical tilt. We further examine this dependence on QBO in QBO-resolving climate models, finding that the cooling signature of strong wave events in models is largely insensitive to QBO phases. This insensitivity is suggested to be linked to model biases in the stratospheric wave representation.

TI A region of suppressed recombination misleads neoavian phylogenomics

AB Genomes are typically mosaics of regions with different evolutionary histories. When speciation events are closely spaced in time, recombination makes the regions sharing the same history small, and the evolutionary history changes rapidly as we move along the genome. When examining rapid radiations such as the early diversification of Neoaves 66 Mya, typically no consistent history is observed across segments exceeding kilobases of the genome. Here, we report an exception. We found that a 21-Mb region in avian genomes, mapped to chicken chromosome 4, shows an extremely strong and discordance-free signal for a history different from that of the inferred species tree. Such a strong discordance-free signal, indicative of suppressed recombination across many millions of base pairs, is not observed elsewhere in the genome for any deep avian relationships. Although long regions with suppressed recombination have been documented in recently diverged species, our results pertain to relationships dating circa 65 Mya. We provide evidence that this strong signal may be due to an ancient rearrangement that blocked recombination and remained polymorphic for several million years prior to fixation. We show that the presence of this region has misled previous phylogenomic efforts with lower taxon sampling, showing the interplay between taxon and locus sampling. We predict that similar ancient rearrangements may confound phylogenetic analyses in other clades, pointing to a need for new analytical models that incorporate the possibility of such events.

ID PROTEIN-STRUCTURE ALIGNMENT; FUNCTION PREDICTION
AB Background: lthough mmCIF is the current official format for deposition of protein and nucleic acid structures to the protein data bank (PDB) database, the legacy PDB format is still the primary supported format for many structural bioinformatics tools. Therefore, reliable software to convert mmCIF structure files to PDB files is needed. Unfortunately, existing conversion programs fail to correctly convert many mmCIF files, especially those with many atoms and/or long chain identifies.Results: his study proposed BeEM, which converts any mmCIF format structure files to PDB format. BeEM conversion faithfully retains all atomic and chain information, including chain IDs with more than 2 characters, which are not supported by any existing mmCIF to PDB converters. The conversion speed of BeEM is at least ten times faster than existing converters such as MAXIT and Phenix. Part of the reason for the speed improvement is the avoidance of conversion between numerical values and text strings.Conclusion: BeEM is a fast and accurate tool for mmCIF-to-PDB format conversion, which is a common procedure in structural biology.

AB Legionella pneumophila is a major cause of waterborne disease in the United States, but little is known about its prevalence in rural homes supplied by domestic well water. With a citizen science campaign involving 57 such homes in Illinois, conclusive results from 39 homes showed intact L. pneumophila in 31% and 28% of warm and hot water samples, respectively. We conducted a quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) for L. pneumophila infection risk using L. pneumophila data from three studies (ours, another on rural homes in North Carolina, and another on a public water supply). The risk of illness was non-negligible in all cases and sometimes exceeded the 10-4 target annual risk. The L. pneumophila concentration and exposure time had the greatest impact on the risk of illness due to a one-time exposure. Aerosol concentration had the greatest impact on the annual risk of illness. A maximum L. pneumophila concentration of 6 x 10-3 copies/mL was needed to achieve the 10-4 target. This study showed that L. pneumophila risk could be present in homes supplied by private wells, like those studied here, but can be mitigated by reducing L. pneumophila concentration, reducing exposure time, and careful consideration of fixtures that produce high concentrations of respirable aerosols.

DE Interplanetary Mission; Multidisciplinary Design and Optimization;

ID ALGORITHM
AB This paper develops a control co-design (CCD) framework to simultaneously optimize the spacecraft's trajectory and onboard system (rocket engine) and quantify its benefit. An open-loop optimal control problem (two-finite burn Mars missions) is used as the benchmark, and the engine design considers the combustion equilibrium and nozzle geometry. The objective function is the fuel burn. The design variables are the trajectory control parameters (such as burn times, burn directions, and time of flight), initial fuel mass, and engine design parameters (such as throat area, mixture ratio, and chamber pressure). The constraints include the final velocities and positions of spacecraft. Single-point optimizations are conducted for three departure dates in May, July, and September 2020. A multipoint optimization is also performed to balance the engine performance for these dates with 49 design variables and 20 constraints. It is found that the CCD optimizations exhibit 22-28% more fuel burn reduction than the trajectory-only optimization with fixed engine parameters and 16-20% more fuel burn reduction than the decoupled trajectory-engine optimization. The proposed CCD optimization framework can be extended to more spacecraft trajectory control parameters and onboard systems and has the potential to design more efficient spacecraft missions.

AB Grid-forming inverters, such as the virtual synchronous generator (VSG), can emulate constant or time-varying inertia to mitigate frequency stability issues. This paper proposes a data-driven variational Bayesian adaptive unscented Kalman filter (VBAUKF) to estimate the VSG-based inverter inertia and damping factor using its terminal measurements. By adopting the Thevenin equivalent idea, the virtual frequency of VSG is estimated first. Utilizing the estimated virtual frequency and considering the effects of the inverter current limiter, the time-varying inertia and damping factor estimation problem is reformulated into the state-space model-based dynamic state estimation framework. The measurements include the obtained virtual frequency, inverter terminal real, and reactive power while the unknowns are inverter inertia, damping factor, internal virtual rotor speed, and angle. To this end, an innovative VBAUKF is proposed with the advantages of dealing with unknown and time-varying models and measurement uncertainties. Numerical results on the modified IEEE 39-bus system and IEEE 118-bus power system demonstrate that the proposed estimator significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches under various scenarios.

AB Additive manufacturing (AM) is now widely used for research and industrial production. The benchmark data for mechanical properties of additively manufactured specimens is very useful for many communities. This data article presents a tensile testing dataset of ASTM D638 size specimens without and with embedded internal geometrical features printed using polylactic acid (PLA) in a Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) additive manufacturing process. The added features can mimic defects of various shapes and sizes. This work is a supplement to the published research article Assisted defect detection by in-process monitoring of additive manufacturing using optical imaging and infrared thermography (Additive Manufacturing, 2023, 103483). The printed specimens were tensile tested. Stress-strain graphs were developed and used to calculate the mechanical properties such as ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and strain at UTS. The mechanical properties, the correlations between mechanical properties and size, shape and location of geometrical features (defects), and the trends in mechanical properties can be useful in benchmarking the results of other researchers.

AB Motivated by humans' ability to adapt skills in the learning of new ones, this paper presents AdaptNet, an approach for modifying the latent space of existing policies to allow new behaviors to be quickly learned from like tasks in comparison to learning from scratch. Building on top of a given reinforcement learning controller, AdaptNet uses a two-tier hierarchy that augments the original state embedding to support modest changes in a behavior and further modifies the policy network layers to make more substantive changes. The technique is shown to be effective for adapting existing physics-based controllers to a wide range of new styles for locomotion, new task targets, changes in character morphology and extensive changes in environment. Furthermore, it exhibits significant increase in learning efficiency, as indicated by greatly reduced training times when compared to training from scratch or using other approaches that modify existing policies. Code is available at https://motion-lab.github.io/AdaptNet.

TI Investigation of strong isothermal stratification effects on multi-mode
   compressible Rayleigh-Taylor instability
SO PHYSICS OF FLUIDS
LA English
DT Article
ID ADAPTIVE MESH REFINEMENT; BOUNDARY-CONDITIONS; SIMULATIONS; LAYER; FLOW
AB Rayleigh-Taylor instability, RTI, occurs at the interface separating two fluids subjected to acceleration when the density gradient and the acceleration are in opposite directions. Previous scientific research primarily considered RTI under the incompressible assumption, which may not be valid in many high-energy-density engineering applications and astrophysical phenomena. In this study, the compressibility effects of the background isothermal stratification strength on multi-mode two-dimensional RTI are explored using fully compressible multi-species direct numerical simulations. Cases under three different isothermal Mach numbers - M a = 0.15 , 0.3 , and 0.45 - are investigated to explore weakly, moderately, and strongly stratified compressible RTI, respectively, at an Atwood number of 0.04. Unlike incompressible RTI, an increase in the flow compressibility through the strength of the background stratification can suppress the RTI growth and can lead to a termination of the RTI mixing layer growth with a highly molecularly mixed state. Our findings suggest that even at the chosen relatively low Atwood number, the variable-density effects can be significantly enhanced due to an increase in the background stratification for the compressible RTI as different spatial profiles become noticeably asymmetric across the mixing layer for the strongly stratified case. In addition, this study compares the chaotic behavior of the cases by studying the transport of the turbulent kinetic energy as well as the vortex dynamics. The Reynolds number dependence of the results is also examined with three different Reynolds numbers, and the findings for the large-scale mixing and flow quantities of interest are shown to be universal in the range of the Reynolds numbers studied.

AB State-of-charge (SoC) dependent bidding allows merchant storage participants to incorporate SoC-dependent operation and opportunity costs in a bid-based market clearing process. However, such a bid results in a non-convex cost function in the multi-interval economic dispatch and market clearing, limiting its implementation in practice. We show that a simple restriction on the bidding format removes the non-convexity, making the multi-interval dispatch of SoC-dependent bids a standard convex piece-wise linear program.

AB We critically reexamine the question of whether volcanic eruptions cause surface warming over Eurasia in winter, in the light of recent modeling studies that have suggested internal variability may overwhelm any forced volcanic response, even for the very largest eruptions during the Common Era. Focusing on the last millennium, we combine model output, instrumental observations, tree-ring records, and ice cores to build a new temperature reconstruction that specifi- fi- cally targets the boreal winter season. We focus on 20 eruptions over the last millennium with volcanic stratospheric sulfur injections (VSSIs) larger than the 1991 Pinatubo eruption. We fi nd that only 7 of these 20 large events are followed by warm surface temperature anomalies over Eurasia in the fi rst posteruption winter. Examining the 13 events that show cold posteruption anomalies, we fi nd no correlation between the amplitude of winter cooling and VSSI mass. We also fi nd no evidence that the North Atlantic Oscillation is correlated with VSSI in winter, a key element of the proposed mechanism through which large, low-latitude eruptions might cause winter warming over Eurasia. Furthermore, by inspecting individual eruptions rather than combining events into a superposed epoch analysis, we are able to reconcile our fi ndings with those of previous studies. Analysis of two additional paleoclimatic datasets corroborates the lack of posteruption Eurasian winter warming. Our fi ndings, covering the entire last millennium, confirm fi rm the fi ndings of most recent modeling studies and offer important new evidence that large, low-latitude eruptions are not, in general, followed by significant fi cant surface wintertime warming over Eurasia.

AB We address the challenge of getting efficient yet accurate recognition systems with limited labels. While recognition models improve with model size and amount of data, many specialized applications of computer vision have severe resource constraints both during training and inference. Transfer learning is an effective solution for training with few labels, however often at the expense of a computationally costly fine-tuning of large base models. We propose to mitigate this unpleasant trade-off between compute and accuracy via semi-supervised cross-domain distillation from a set of diverse source models. Initially, we show how to use task similarity metrics to select a single suitable source model to distill from, and that a good selection process is imperative for good downstream performance of a target model. We dub this approach DISTILLNEAREST. Though effective, DISTILLNEAREST assumes a single source model matches the target task, which is not always the case. To alleviate this, we propose a weighted multi-source distillation method to distill multiple source models trained on different domains weighted by their relevance for the target task into a single efficient model (named DISTILLWEIGHTED). Our methods need no access to source data and merely need features and pseudo-labels of the source models. When the goal is accurate recognition under computational constraints, both DISTILLNEAREST and DISTILLWEIGHTED approaches outperform both transfer learning from strong ImageNet initializations as well as state-of-the-art semi-supervised techniques such as FixMatch. Averaged over 8 diverse target tasks our multi-source method outperforms the baselines by 5.6%-points and 4.5%-points, respectively. Code: github.com/Kennethborup/DistillWeighted

AB Photocatalysts integrated with surface plasmon metals serve as an interesting platform for fully understanding how energy harvesting and storage are managed through physical and chemical enhancement processes. Nanoelectrode with a single plasmon metal nanoparticle (NP) provides unique features capable of resolving complex enhancement processes which otherwise cannot be achievable through conventional ensemble averaging methods. Preliminary theoretical results are presented here to illustrate both electrochemical and optical field enhancement characteristics of a single NP when interacting with a semiconductor surface. Potential methodologies to construct single plasmon nanoelectrodes and challenges are discussed in this opinion.

AB Using big data, distributed computing systems such as Apache Hadoop requires processing massive amount of data to support business and research applications. Thus, it is critical to ensure the cyber security of such systems. To better defend from advanced cyber attacks that pose threats to even well-protected enterprises, system-auditing based techniques have been adopted for monitoring system activities and assisting attack investigation. In this demo, we are building a system that collects system auditing logs from a big data system and performs data analysis to understand how system auditing can be used more effectively to assist attack investigation on big systems. We also built a demo application that detects unexpected file deletion and presents root causes for the deletion.

AB Severe convective storms and tornadoes rank among nature's most hazardous phenomena, inflicting significant property damage and casualties. Near-surface weather conditions are closely governed by large-scale synoptic patterns. It is crucial to delve into the involved multiscale associations to understand tornado potential in response to climate change. Using clustering analysis, this study unveils that leading synoptic patterns driving tornadic storms and associated spatial trends are distinguishable across geographic regions in the U.S. Synoptic patterns with intense forcing featured by intense upper-level eddy kinetic energy and a dense distribution of Z500 fields dominate the increasing trend in tornado frequency in the southeast U.S., generating more tornadoes per event. Conversely, the decreasing trend noted in certain regions of the central Great Plains is associated with weak upper-level synoptic forcing. These findings offer an explanation of observational changes in tornado occurrences, suggesting that the physical mechanisms driving those changes differ across regions.

AB The printing of Inconel 625 via wire-fed laser directed energy deposition is required for the near net shape fabrication of large scale components. In this study, an array of processing parameters was tested to identify a defect-free low-travel-speed and high-travel speed parameter for wire-fed laser directed energy deposition of Inconel 625. Samples printed using these parameters were subject to characterization in terms of grain morphology and tensile properties. Results showed that the high-travel-speed parameter had a refined columnar+equiaxed grain structure, whereas the low-travel-speed parameter had a columnar grain structure. The experimentally observed microstructure is correlated to the processing parameters by calculation of the solidification rate and thermal gradient. When tested perpendicular to the build direction, both parameters exhibited a similar yield strength. When tested parallel to the build direction, the high-travel-speed parameter exhibited a higher yield strength than the low-travel-speed parameter. For both parameters, samples pulled parallel to the build-direction showed a lower yield strength than samples pulled perpendicular to the build direction. The differences in yield strength for differing parameters and orientation are attributed primarily to dislocation strengthening.

AB Phenanthracene nanotubes with arylene-ethynylene-butadiynylene rims and phenanthracene walls are synthesized in a modular bottom-up approach. One of the rims carries hexadecyloxy side chains, mediating the affinity to highly oriented pyrolytic graphite. Molecular dynamics simulations show that the nanotubes are much more flexible than their structural formulas suggest: In 1(2), the phenanthracene units act as hinges that flip the two macrocycles relative to each other to one of two possible sites, as quantum mechanical models suggest and scanning tunneling microscopy investigations prove. Unexpectedly, both theory and experiment show for 1(3) that the three phenanthracene hinges are deflected from the upright position, accompanied by a deformation of both macrocycles from their idealized sturdy macroporous geometry. This flexibility together with their affinity to carbon-rich substrates allows for an efficient host-guest chemistry at the solid/gas interface opening the potential for applications in single-walled carbon nanotube-based sensing, and the applicability to build new sensors for the detection of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene via nitroaromatic markers is shown.

AB Mixed europium-barium titanate perovskites, EuxBa1-xTiO3, were investigated as nanocatalysts for the photodetoxification of a mustard gas surrogate, 2-chloroethylethyl sulfide, CEES. EuxBa1-xTiO3 nanoparticles were prepared using an enhanced sol-gel method, resulting in 10-25 nm particles. A lanthanide valence and nanostructure was altered by applying a heat treatment in either oxidizing or reducing atmospheres. The results demonstrated a high adsorption capacity and improved catalytic decomposition activity in comparison to a set of previously explored transition metal oxide photocatalysts, including barium titanate. Analysis of the decomposition products indicated hydrolysis as the predominant reactive detoxification mechanism in the dark. Upon light irradiation, radicals were formed and contributed to the degradation and oxidation of CEES, especially in the sample rich in Eu(III) and oxygen, with a more developed porosity. The results suggested photogenerated electrons and holes, influenced by the presence of Eu, contributed to the free radical formation and oxidation reactions, respectively, increasing both the weight uptake and efficiency of catalytic decomposition.

AB Liquid infiltration is one of the commonly adapted flow mechanisms in microscale/nanoscale heat-transfer applications. The theoretical modeling of dynamic infiltration profile in the microscale/nanoscale requires a deep study, because the acting forces are entirely different from those of a large-scale system. Herein, a model equation is developed from the fundamental force balance at the microscale/nanoscale level, to capture the dynamic infiltration flow profile. Molecular kinetic theory (MKT) is used to predict the dynamic contact angle. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are performed to study the capillary infiltration in two different geometries. The infiltration length is computed from the simulation results. The model is also evaluated over surfaces having different surface wettability. The generated model provides a better estimation of the infiltration length, compared to the well-established models. The developed model is expected to aid in the designing of microscale/nanoscale devices where liquid infiltration plays a key role.

AB Finding correspondences between images is a fundamental problem in computer vision. In this paper, we show that correspondence emerges in image diffusion models without any explicit supervision. We propose a simple strategy to extract this implicit knowledge out of diffusion networks as image features, namely DIffusion FeaTures (DIFT), and use them to establish correspondences between real images. Without any additional fine-tuning or supervision on the task-specific data or annotations, DIFT is able to outperform both weakly-supervised methods and competitive off-the-shelf features in identifying semantic, geometric, and temporal correspondences. Particularly for semantic correspondence, DIFT from Stable Diffusion is able to outperform DINO and OpenCLIP by 19 and 14 accuracy points respectively on the challenging SPair-71k benchmark. It even outperforms the state-of-the-art supervised methods on 9 out of 18 categories while remaining on par for the overall performance. Project page: https://diffusionfeatures. github.io.

AB Employment scams are a growing and serious issue, increasingly targeting job seekers and exploiting vulnerabilities in the online recruitment process. Current employment scam studies focus primarily on virtual spaces during job searches, neglecting the impact of hybrid spaces (physical and virtual spaces combined) on cyber victimization. This study, leveraging advancements in artificial intelligence, assessed victimization and developed mechanisms to help job seekers reduce their risk of employment scams, considering the physical locations in the real world, as well as the virtual locations described in the job postings. The results show that the consistency of geographic information in the hybrid space of fake job postings is lower than that of legitimate job postings, and there is spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of the physical locations of fake job postings. This consistency, as well as detailed physical location, contributes significantly to the identification and classification of genuine and fake postings. Integrating multiple disciplines, this research enhances understanding of the prevalence, impact, contributing factors, and mitigation strategies associated with cyber victimization during employment. It also contributes to the development of novel methodologies and approaches for detecting, mitigating, and preventing cybercrime.

AB Pretrained Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), developed from extensive datasets to integrate multifaceted knowledge, are increasingly recognized as valuable intellectual property (IP). To safeguard these models against IP infringement, strategies for ownership verification and usage authorization have emerged. Unlike most existing IP protection strategies that concentrate on restricting direct access to the model, our study addresses an extended DNN IP issue: applicability authorization, aiming to prevent the misuse of learned knowledge, particularly in unauthorized transfer learning scenarios. We propose Non-Transferable Pruning (NTP), a novel IP protection method that leverages model pruning to control a pretrained DNN's transferability to unauthorized data domains. Selective pruning can deliberately diminish a model's suitability on unauthorized domains, even with full fine-tuning. Specifically, our framework employs the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for optimizing both the model sparsity and an innovative non-transferable learning loss, augmented with fisher space discriminative regularization, to constrain the model's generalizability to the target dataset. We also propose a novel effective metric to measure the model non-transferability: Area Under the Sample-wise Learning Curve (SLC-AUC). This metric facilitates consideration of full fine-tuning across various sample sizes. Experimental results demonstrate that NTP significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art non-transferable learning methods, with an average SLC-AUC at -0.54 across diverse pairs of source and target domains, indicating that models trained with NTP do not suit for transfer learning to unauthorized target domains. The efficacy of NTP is validated in both supervised and self-supervised learning contexts, confirming its applicability in real-world scenarios. Git Repo

TI Photoresponsive hydrogel friction
SO SOFT MATTER
LA English
DT Article
AB Photoresponsive hydrogels are an emerging class of stimuli-responsive materials that exhibit changes in physical or chemical properties in response to light. Previous investigations have leveraged photothermal mechanisms to achieve reversible changes in hydrogel friction, although few have focused on photochemical means. To date, the tribological properties of photoswitchable hydrogels (e.g., friction and lubrication) have remained underexplored. In this work, we incorporated photoresponsive methoxy-spiropyran-methacrylate monomers (methoxy-SP-MA) into a hydrogel network to form a copolymerized system of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid-co-methoxy-spiropyran-methacrylate) (p(NIPAAm-co-AMPS-co-SP)). We demonstrated repeatable photoresponsive changes to swelling, friction, and stiffness over three light cycles. Our findings suggest that volume changes driven by the decreased hydrophilicity of the methoxy-SP-MA upon light irradiation are responsible for differences in the mechanical and tribological properties of our photoresponsive hydrogels. Our results could inform future designs of photoswitchable hydrogels for applications ranging from biomedical applications to soft robotics.
   Photoresponsive hydrogels exhibit changes in their tribological, mechanical, and swelling behavior in response to light.

TI Gaussian Process Regression with Soft Equality Constraints
SO MATHEMATICS
LA English
DT Article
DE Gaussian process regression; quantum-inspired Hamiltonian Monte Carlo;
   equality constraints
AB This study introduces a novel Gaussian process (GP) regression framework that probabilistically enforces physical constraints, with a particular focus on equality conditions. The GP model is trained using the quantum-inspired Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (QHMC) algorithm, which efficiently samples from a wide range of distributions by allowing a particle's mass matrix to vary according to a probability distribution. By integrating QHMC into the GP regression with probabilistic handling of the constraints, this approach balances the computational cost and accuracy in the resulting GP model, as the probabilistic nature of the method contributes to shorter execution times compared with existing GP-based approaches. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive learning algorithm to optimize the selection of constraint locations to further enhance the flexibility of the method. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithm on synthetic examples, including 2-dimensional and 10-dimensional GP models under noisy conditions, as well as a practical application involving the reconstruction of a sparsely observed steady-state heat transport problem. The proposed approach reduces the posterior variance in the resulting model, achieving stable and accurate sampling results across all test cases while maintaining computational efficiency.

AB The study of spreading processes on complex networks has gained significant attention recently. For example, bond percolation models considering population heterogeneity have been used to provide insights into disease spread and misinformation control. However, most of these studies focus on single-layer contact networks. In our work, we examine how the spreading process is impacted by the existence of multiple contact network layers, considering layer-dependent population heterogeneity from a principled, mathematical perspective. Using SIR dynamics, we derive expressions for three key epidemiological measures: the probability of emergence, the epidemic threshold, and the expected epidemic size. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that our analytical results match the numerical results near-perfectly in the finite node regime. These findings reveal the interplay among the multi-layer network structures, transmission dynamics, and population heterogeneity in determining the final outcome of the spreading process. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of layer-dependent population heterogeneity and identify important factors for developing effective and economical layer-oriented spreading control strategies. Overall, our work provides insights into developing and analyzing mitigation and control strategies for disease spread and information diffusion across multi-layer complex networks.

AB Hydrogels are explored for applications in agriculture, water purification, and biomedicine, leveraging softness, elasticity, and high water uptake. However, hydrogels are notoriously brittle, especially at high water content. This shortcoming puts the improvement of hydrogel mechanics at the forefront of current research. Yet modern strategies for enhancing gel resilience come at the expense of softness and swelling. This problem is addressed using bottlebrush networks with disentangled strands and hidden length reservoirs, which synergistically enhance gel swelling and robustness while maintaining their softness. Implementing a facile one-pot synthesis of single-stranded bottlebrush networks with a relatively hydrophobic poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA) backbone and hydrophilic poly(2-methyl-2-oxazoline) (PMOx) side chains, hydrogels are prepared with a modulus below <1 kPa and swelling ratios up to 125 that can withstand up to 10-fold extension.

AB This study presents the Br-rich in situ synthesis of blue-emitting 2D CsPbBr3 nanoplatelets (NPLs) with various Br/Pb ratios using ZnBr2 as a Br precursor to enhance Br ion adsorption significantly. This leads to effective passivation of surface defects, particularly Pb-Br bonds, by increasing the positive charge density around Pb atoms, thus creating a stable bonding environment and reducing defect formation. Consequently, the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) improves from 31.15% for a Br/Pb ratio of 2 to 87.2% for a ratio of 6. NPLs with a Br/Pb ratio of 6 also exhibit longer lifetimes (16.69 ns) and slower bleach recovery dynamics, indicating fewer non-radiative recombination pathways and effective exciton dynamics. Additionally, NPLs with the Br/Pb ratio of 6 demonstrated better thermal stability, with an activation energy of 124.3 meV, indicating stronger exciton binding. These NPLs also exhibited enhanced stability, with UV tolerance at 43.9% and water resistance at 23.8%, making them suitable for displays and lighting. Furthermore, Br-passivated CsPbBr3 NPLs are used as blue emitters in prototype white LEDs, achieving a wide color gamut, 126.6% of the National Television Standards Committee and 94.5% of Rec. 2020, demonstrating their potential for high-quality lighting and advanced display technologies.

AB Discrete mesoscale network models, in which explicitly modeled polymer chains are replaced by implicit pairwise potentials, are capable of predicting the macroscale mechanical response of polymeric materials such as elastomers and gels, while offering greater insight into microstructural phenomena than constitutive theory or macroscale experiments alone. However, whether such mesoscale models accurately represent the molecular structures of polymer networks requires investigation during their development, particularly in the case of dynamic polymers that restructure in time. We here introduce and compare the topological and mechanical predictions of an idealized, reduced-order mesoscale approach in which only tethered dynamic bonding sites and crosslinks in a polymer's backbone are explicitly modeled, to those of molecular theory and a Kremer-Grest, coarse-grained molecular dynamics approach. We find that for short chain networks (similar to 12 Kuhn lengths per chain segment) at intermediate polymer packing fractions, undergoing relatively slow loading rates (compared to the monomer diffusion rate), the mesoscale approach reasonably reproduces the chain conformations, bond kinetic rates, and ensemble stress responses predicted by molecular theory and the bead-spring model. Further, it does so with a 90% reduction in computational cost. These savings grant the mesoscale model access to larger spatiotemporal domains than conventional molecular dynamics, enabling simulation of large deformations as well as durations approaching experimental timescales (e.g., those utilized in dynamic mechanical analysis). While the model investigated is for monodisperse polymer networks in theta-solvent, without entanglement, charge interactions, long-range dynamic bond interactions, or other confounding physical effects, this work highlights the utility of these models and lays a foundational groundwork for the incorporation of such phenomena moving forward.

AB The interactions between the electronic magnetic moment and the nuclear spin moment, i.e., magnetic hyperfine (HF) interactions, play an important role in understanding electronic properties of magnetic systems and in realizing platforms for quantum information science applications. We investigate the HF interactions for atomic systems and small molecules, including Ti or Mn, by using Fermi-L & ouml;wdin orbital (FLO) based self-interaction corrected (SIC) density-functional theory. We calculate the Fermi contact (FC) and spin-dipole terms for the systems within the local density approximation (LDA) in the FLO-SIC method and compare them with the corresponding values without SIC within the LDA and generalized-gradient approximation (GGA), as well as experimental data. For the moderately heavy atomic systems (atomic number Z <= 25), we find that the mean absolute error of the FLO-SIC FC term is about 27 MHz (percentage error is 6.4%), while that of the LDA and GGA results is almost double that. Therefore, in this case, the FLO-SIC results are in better agreement with the experimental data. For the non-transition-metal molecules, the FLO-SIC FC term has the mean absolute error of 68 MHz, which is comparable to both the LDA and GGA results without SIC. For the seven transition-metal-based molecules, the FLO-SIC mean absolute error is 59 MHz, whereas the corresponding LDA and GGA errors are 101 and 82 MHz, respectively. Therefore, for the transition-metal-based molecules, the FLO-SIC FC term agrees better with experiment than the LDA and GGA results. We observe that the FC term from the FLO-SIC calculation is not necessarily larger than that from the LDA or GGA for all the considered systems due to the core spin polarization, in contrast to the expectation that SIC would increase the spin density near atomic nuclei, leading to larger FC terms.

AB A high-performance solid electrolyte is critical for all-solid-state Li metal batteries which possess good safety and high energy densities. In this study, inspired by the unique ionic transport function and excellent adhesive properties of natural proteins, we successfully generated a novel solid electrolyte by applying soy protein as a dual-functional bridge to enable additional ion-conduction pathways and improve mechanical performance. The solid electrolyte with soy protein that interacts with both SiO2 nanofabrics and polypolyethylene oxide (PEO) exhibits high ionic conductivity of 10(-5) S cm(-1) (vs. 10(-6) S cm(-1) of SiO2/PEO), improved Li+ transference number of 0.550 (vs. 0.446 of SiO2/PEO), high Young's modulus of 1.862 MPa (vs. 0.356 MPa of SiO2/PEO) and excellent flexibility. As a result, the solid-state batteries with LiFePO4 as cathode demonstrate a stable discharge capacity. This work provides a new strategy to advance the performance of solid electrolytes for achieving long-lifespan all-solid-state batteries.

ID DEPRESSION; HEALTH
AB Individuals such as medical interns who work in high-stress environments often face mental health challenges including depression and anxiety. These challenges are exacerbated by the limited access to traditional mental health services due to demanding work schedules. In this context, mobile health interventions such as push notifications targeting behavioral modification to improve mental health outcomes could deliver much needed support. In this work, we study the effectiveness of these interventions on subgroups, by studying the conditional average causal effect of these interventions. We design a two step approach for estimating the conditional average causal effect of interventions and identifying specific subgroups of the population who respond positively or negatively to the interventions. The first step of our approach follows existing causal effect estimation approaches, while the second step involves a novel tree-based approach to identify subgroups who respond to the treatment. The novelty in the second step stems from a pruning approach that deploys hypothesis testing to identify subgroups experiencing a statistically significant positive or negative causal effect. Using a semi-simulated dataset, we show that our approach retrieves affected subpopulations with a higher precision than alternatives while maintaining the same recall and accuracy. Using a real dataset with randomized push interventions among the medical intern population at a large hospital, we show how our approach can be used to identify subgroups who might benefit the most from interventions.

AB A striking example of the need to accurately capture states of double-excitation character in molecules is seen in predicting photoinduced dynamics in small polyenes. Due to the coupling of electronic and nuclear motions, the dark 21Ag state, known to have double-excitation character, can be reached after an initial photoexcitation to the bright 11Bu state via crossings of their potential energy surfaces. However, the shapes of the surfaces are so poorly captured by most electronic structure methods, that the crossing is missed or substantially mis-located. We demonstrate that the frequency-dependent kernel of dressed TDDFT beyond Tamm-Dancoff successfully captures the curve-crossing, providing an energy surface close to the highly accurate but more expensive delta-CR-EOMCC(2,3) benchmark reference. This, along with its accurate prediction of the excitation character of the state makes dressed TDDFT a practical and accurate route to electronic structure quantities needed in modeling ultrafast dynamics in molecules.

AB Shear-recoverable hydrogels based on block copolypeptides with rapid self-recovery hold potential in extrudable and injectable 3D-printing applications. In this work, a series of 3-arm star-shaped block copolypeptides composed of an inner hydrophilic poly(l-glutamate) domain and an outer & beta;-sheet forming domain is synthesized with varying side chains and block lengths. By changing the & beta;-sheet forming domains, hydrogels with diverse microstructures and mechanical properties are prepared and structure-function relationships are determined using scattering and rheological techniques. Differences in the properties of these materials are amplified during direct-ink writing with a strong correlation observed between printability and material chemistry. Significantly, it is observed that non-canonical & beta;-sheet blocks based on phenyl glycine form more stable networks with superior mechanical properties and writability compared to widely used natural amino acid counterparts. The versatile design available through block copolypeptide materials provides a robust platform to access tunable material properties based solely on molecular design. These systems can be exploited in extrusion-based applications such as 3D-printing without the need for additives.

AB Atmospheric Solids Analysis Probe (ASAP) mass spectrometry is a versatile technique allowing direct sampling of solid and liquid samples, but its adoption is limited due to the high cost of commercial ASAP systems. To address this, we present OpenASAP, an open-source ASAP system for mass spectrometers that can be fabricated for $20 or less using 3D-printing. Our design is readily adaptable to instruments from different manufacturers and can be produced with a variety of additive manufacturing techniques on consumer-grade 3D-printers. The probe allows for rapid sampling of solid and liquid samples without sample preparation, making it useful for high throughput screening, investigating spatial localization and function of analytes in biological samples, and incorporating mass spectrometry in instructional settings. We demonstrate its effectiveness by obtaining mass spectra of three natural product standards at levels as low as 10 ng/ml in liquid samples, and detecting these metabolites in microbial cultures that are difficult to analyze due to complex sample matrices or analyte properties. Furthermore, we demonstrate direct sampling of thin layer chromatography (TLC) spots of these cultures.

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY

   low-power wireless networks
ID LAYER SECURITY; WIRELESS
AB Illegal intelligent reflecting surfaces (I-IRSs), i.e., the illegal deployment and utilization of IRSs, impose serious harmful impacts on wireless networks. The existing I-IRS-based illegal jammer (IJ) requires channel state information (CSI) or extra power or both, and therefore, the I-IRS-based IJ seems to be difficult to implement in practical wireless networks. To raise concerns about significant potential threats posed by I-IRSs, we propose an alternative method to jam legitimate users (LUs) without relying on the CSI. By using an I-IRS to actively change wireless channels, the orthogonality of multi-user beamforming vectors and the co-user channels is destroyed, and significant inter-user interference is then caused, which is referred to as active channel aging. Such a fully-passive jammer (FPJ) can launch jamming attacks on multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) systems via inter-user interference caused by active channel aging, where the IJ requires no additional transmit power and instantaneous CSI. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed FPJ scheme. Moreover, we also investigate how the transmit power and the number of quantization phase shift bits influence the jamming performance.

TI Physics-aware differentiable design of magnetically actuated kirigami
   for shape morphing
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
AB Shape morphing that transforms morphologies in response to stimuli is crucial for future multifunctional systems. While kirigami holds great promise in enhancing shape-morphing, existing designs primarily focus on kinematics and overlook the underlying physics. This study introduces a differentiable inverse design framework that considers the physical interplay between geometry, materials, and stimuli of active kirigami, made by soft material embedded with magnetic particles, to realize target shape-morphing upon magnetic excitation. We achieve this by combining differentiable kinematics and energy models into a constrained optimization, simultaneously designing the cuts and magnetization orientations to ensure kinematic and physical feasibility. Complex kirigami designs are obtained automatically with unparalleled efficiency, which can be remotely controlled to morph into intricate target shapes and even multiple states. The proposed framework can be extended to accommodate various active systems, bridging geometry and physics to push the frontiers in shape-morphing applications, like flexible electronics and minimally invasive surgery.
   A differentiable design framework that integrates both geometrical and magnetomechanical analyses to inversely program the shape morphing in magnetically actuated kirigami is proposed, achieving intricate shapes and multistate transitions.

AB The influence of aqueous solutions of 2-(tetrafluoro(trifluoromethyl)-lambda 6-sulfanyl-ethan-1-ol (CF3SF4-ethanol) and 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE) on the secondary structure of melittin was studied using circular dichroism (CD) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In water, melittin transitions into a random coil. However, upon addition of even as little as 1% by volume of CF3SF4-ethanol, the secondary structure of melittin stabilizes as a helix. Contrarily, the addition of 40% by volume of TFE is required for the greatest helicity. Fluoroalcohols stabilize melittin's hydrophobic side chain residues, thereby enhancing the helical structure. Locally alcohol concentrations approach nearly 70-90% in the near vicinity of the hydrophobic side chains increasing hydrophobic interactions and reducing water-peptide hydrogen bonding. Using the molecular mechanics-Poisson Boltzmann surface area method (MMPBSA), the free energy of binding between the peptide and fluoroalcohols highlighted the role of nonpolar residues in stabilizing the secondary structure. Secondary structure content analysis (SESCA) validated the simulation results, confirming CF3SF4-ethanol as an effective, eco-friendly enhancer of helicity at low concentrations. The far UV circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of melittin in solutions containing TFE corroborates previous findings and likewise affirms that the addition of CF3SF4-ethanol to an aqueous solution can enhance helicity. The agreement between the experimental and calculated helicities highlights the potential of CF3SF4-ethanol. This study offers insights into peptide stabilization by fluoroalcohols, with implications for peptide-based therapeutic design.

AB Drylands are unique among terrestrial ecosystems in that they have a significant proportion of primary production facilitated by non-vascular plants such as colonial cyanobacteria, moss, and lichens, i.e., biocrusts, which occur on and in the surface soil. Biocrusts inhabit all continents, including Antarctica, an increasingly dynamic continent on the precipice of change. Here, we describe in-situ field surveying and sampling, remote sensing, and modeling approaches to assess the habitat suitability of biocrusts in the Lake Fryxell basin of Taylor Valley, Antarctica, which is the main site of the McMurdo Dry Valleys Long-Term Ecological Research Program. Soils suitable for the development of biocrusts are typically wetter, less alkaline, and less saline compared to unvegetated soils. Using random forest models, we show that gravimetric water content, electrical conductivity, and snow frequency are the top predictors of biocrust presence and biomass. Areas most suitable for the growth of dense biocrusts are soils associated with seasonal snow patches. Using geospatial data to extrapolate our habitat suitability model to the whole basin predicts that biocrusts are present in 2.7 x 105 m2 and contain 11-72 Mg of aboveground carbon, based on the 90% probability of occurrence. Our study illustrates the synergistic effect of combining field and remote sensing data for understanding the distribution and biomass of biocrusts, a foundational community in the carbon balance of this region. Extreme weather events and changing climate conditions in this region, especially those influencing snow accumulation and persistence, could have significant effects on the future distribution and abundance of biocrusts and therefore soil organic carbon storage in the McMurdo Dry Valleys.
   Biocrusts are dominant primary producer communities inhabiting the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica. We found that gravimetric water content, electrical conductivity, and snow frequency are the top predictors of biocrust presence and biomass. We predict that biocrusts are present in 2.7 x 105 m2 and contain 11-72 Mg of aboveground carbon in the Lake Fryxell basin, often occurring on soils associated with seasonal snow patches. Our study illustrates the synergistic effect of combining field and remote sensing data for understanding and predicting ecological dynamics in the context of a changing climate.image

AB Dynamic Theater explores the use of augmented reality (AR) in immersive theater as a platform for digital dance performances. The project presents a locomotion-based experience that allows for full spatial exploration. A large indoor AR theater space was designed to allow users to freely explore the augmented environment. The curated wide-area experience employs various guidance mechanisms to direct users to the main content zones. Results from our 20-person user study show how users experience the performance piece while using a guidance system. The importance of stage layout, guidance system, and dancer placement in immersive theater experiences are highlighted as they cater to user preferences while enhancing the overall reception of digital content in wide-area AR. Observations after working with dancers and choreographers, as well as their experience and feedback are also discussed.

In such applications, a major concern is that these models sometimes discriminate against certain demographic groups such as individuals with certain race, gender, or age. Another major concern in these applications is the violation of the privacy of users. While fair learning algorithms have been developed to mitigate discrimination issues, these algorithms can still leak sensitive information, such as individuals' health or financial records. Utilizing the notion of differential privacy (DP), prior works aimed at developing learning algorithms that are both private and fair. However, existing algorithms for DP fair learning are either not guaranteed to converge or require full batch of data in each iteration of the algorithm to converge. In this paper, we provide the first stochastic differentially private algorithm for fair learning that is guaranteed to converge. Here, the term "stochastic" refers to the fact that our proposed algorithm converges even when minibatches of data are used at each iteration (i.e. stochastic optimization). Our framework is flexible enough to permit different fairness notions, including demographic parity and equalized odds. In addition, our algorithm can be applied to non-binary classification tasks with multiple (non-binary) sensitive attributes. As a byproduct of our convergence analysis, we provide the first utility guarantee for a DP algorithm for solving nonconvex-strongly concave min-max problems. Our numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithm consistently offers significant performance gains over the state-of-the-art baselines, and can be applied to larger scale problems with non-binary target/sensitive attributes.

AB This work presents a systematic strategy for selecting an "optimal" predictive computational model among a set of possible mechanistic models of a physical system. To this end, the Occam-Plausibility Algorithm (Farrell-Maupin et al., 2015) is extended by introducing a method for the design of model-specific validation experiments to provide data that portray the features of the prediction quantities of interest. Leveraging Bayesian inference and model plausibility, the framework adaptively balances the trade-off between complexity and validity of the models while taking into account the uncertainty in data, model parameters, and the choice of the model itself for making reliable computational predictions. An application of this framework is demonstrated in discrete-continuum multiscale modeling of size-dependent plasticity in polycrystalline materials, involving dislocation dynamics simulations and strain gradient plasticity models.This study suggests that the effectiveness of validation experiments relies upon the choice of the model; thus, a validation data set that adequately informs a predictive computational model may not be effective for validating other models. Additionally, the multiscale modeling results show that, given the discrete dislocation dynamics data, the optimal strain gradient plasticity model for predicting the deformation of a microelectromechanical system is obtained by excluding the isotropic hardening mechanism.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB The negative environmental impacts of the current linear system of textile and apparel production are well-documented and require urgent action. The sector lacks an effective recycling system, resulting in massive waste and environmental pollution. This paper presents the results of qualitative research involving textile and apparel industry stakeholders, including representatives from brands and retailers, waste collectors, recyclers, non-profit organizations, academic institutions, and government agencies. Our research focused on stakeholder perceptions of the significance and importance of textile circularity, the challenges that exist for transitioning the textile and apparel industry from a linear system to a circular economy (CE), and resources that exist to support this transition. The results of this study call attention to the following urgent requirements: a consistent definition of CE to promote transparency and accountability and prevent greenwashing; improved systems for materials identification, sorting, and pre-processing of post-consumer textile waste to enable recycling; innovations in mechanical recycling technologies to maintain the value of recycled materials; and new, materials-driven approaches to design and manufacturing that are responsive to feedstock variability and diverse consumer needs. The research findings also suggest the need for flexible, regional CEs that are rooted in community partnerships.

AB There are many factors in the current phase of the COVID-19 pandemic that signal the need for new modeling ideas. In fact, most traditional infectious disease models do not address adequately the waning immunity, in particular as new emerging variants have been able to break the immune shield acquired either by previous infection by a different strain of the virus, or by inoculation of vaccines not effective for the current variant. Furthermore, in a post-pandemic landscape in which reporting is no longer a default, it is impossible to have reliable quantitative data at the population level. Our contribution to COVID-19 post-pandemic modeling is a simple mathematical predictive model along the age-distributed population framework, that can take into account the waning immunity in a transparent and easily controllable manner. Numerical simulations show that under static conditions, the model produces periodic solutions that are qualitatively similar to the reported data, with the period determined by the immunity waning profile. Evidence from the mathematical model indicates that the immunity dynamics is the main factor in the recurrence of infection spikes, however, irregular perturbation of the transmission rate, due to either mutations of the pathogen or human behavior, may result in suppression of recurrent spikes, and irregular time intervals between consecutive peaks. The spike amplitudes are sensitive to the transmission rate and vaccination strategies, but also to the skewness of the profile describing the waning immunity, suggesting that these factors should be taken into consideration when making predictions about future outbreaks.

AB The AMX Zintl compound CaAgSb was recently identified as a promising thermoelectric material with high hole mobility and low lattice thermal conductivity. The single parabolic band model predicts that a zT of similar to 1 can be achieved if the carrier concentration can be tuned to similar to 1019 cm-3. However, the high inherent p-type carrier concentration of similar to 1020 cm-3 in CaAgSb has limited further optimization of zT in p-type samples and has prevented n-type doping. In this work, we use a combination of computational and experimental tools to study the Fermi-level tunability of CaAgSb. Defect calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) reveal that acceptor-type defects, in particular Ag-vacancies, are the dominant defect across the full chemical potential space. This pins the Fermi energy within the valence band, leading to predicted p-type carrier concentrations that fluctuate within a narrow range. Crystal Orbital Hamilton Population (COHP) analysis shows that the Ag-Sb antibonding orbitals lie below the Fermi energy, which may explain the low Ag-vacancy formation energy in CaAgSb. Experimentally, we used a phase boundary mapping approach to explore the defect chemistry under different synthesis conditions. Samples were synthesized in the Ca-rich, Ag-rich, and Sb-rich regions of the phase diagram, and all were found to have high p-type carrier concentrations, ranging from 6.0 x 1019 to 1.8 x 1020 cm-3, and therefore similar thermal and electronic properties, consistent with the defect calculations. Taken together, our results confirm that Ag vacancies act as killer defects in CaAgSb, posing the primary challenge for further improvement of thermoelectric performance.

AB JWST has revealed a population of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei at z > 4 in compact, red hosts (the "Little Red Dots," or LRDs), which are largely undetected in X-rays. We investigate this phenomenon using General Relativistic Radiation Magnetohydrodynamics simulations of super-Eddington accretion onto a supermassive black hole (SMBH) with M-center dot = 10(7)M(circle dot) at z similar to 6, representing the median population; the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) that we obtain are intrinsically X-ray weak. The highest levels of X-ray weakness occur in SMBHs accreting at mildly super-Eddington rates (1.4 < f(Edd) < 4) with zero spin, viewed at angles >30 degrees from the pole. X-ray bolometric corrections in the observed 2-10 keV band reach similar to 10(4) at z = 6, similar to 5 times higher than the highest constraint from X-ray stacking. Most SEDs are extraordinarily steep and soft in the X-rays (median photon index Gamma = 3.1, mode of Gamma = 4.4). SEDs strong in the X-rays have harder spectra with a high-energy bump when viewed near the hot (>10(8) K) and highly relativistic jet, whereas X-ray weak SEDs lack this feature. Viewing an SMBH within 10 degrees of its pole, where beaming enhances the X-ray emission, has a similar to 1.5% probability, matching the LRD X-ray detection rate. Next-generation observatories like AXIS will detect X-ray-weak LRDs at z similar to 6 from any viewing angle. Although many SMBHs in the LRDs are already estimated to accrete at super-Eddington rates, our model explains 50% of their population by requiring that their masses are overestimated by a mere factor of similar to 3. In summary, we suggest that LRDs host slowly spinning SMBHs accreting at mildly super-Eddington rates, with large covering factors and broad emission lines enhanced by strong winds, providing a self-consistent explanation for their X-ray weakness and complementing other models.

AB The structural and chemical properties of metal nanoparticles are often dictated by their interactions with molecular ligand shells. These interactions are highly material-specific and can vary significantly even among elements within the same group or materials with similar crystal structure. In this study, we surveyed the heterogeneous interactions between an m-terphenyl isocyanide ligand and Au and Ag nanoparticles (NPs) at the single-molecule limit. Specifically, we found that the ligation behavior with this molecule differs significantly between that of Au and AgNPs. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy measurements revealed unique enhancement factors for two molecular vibrational modes between two metal surfaces, indicating different ligand binding geometries. Molecular-level characterization using scanning tunneling microscopy allowed us to directly visualize these variations between Ag and Au surfaces, which we assign as two distinct binding mechanisms. This molecular-scale visualization provides clear insights into the different ligand-metal interactions as well as the chemical behavior and spectroscopic characteristics of isocyanide-functionalized NPs.

AB In engineering design, global sensitivity analysis (GSA) is used for analyzing the effects of inputs on the system response and is commonly studied with analytical or surrogate models. However, such models fail to capture nonlinear behaviors in complex systems and involve several modeling assumptions. Besides model-focused methods, a data-driven GSA approach, rooted in interpretable machine learning, would also identify the relationships between system components. Moreover, a special need in engineering design extends beyond performing GSA for input variables individually, but instead evaluating the contributions of variable groups on the system response. In this article, we introduce a flexible, interpretable artificial neural network model to uncover individual as well as grouped global sensitivity indices for understanding complex physical interactions in engineering design problems. The proposed model allows the investigation of the main effects and second-order effects in GSA according to functional analysis of variance (FANOVA) decomposition. To draw a higher-level understanding, we further use the subset decomposition method to analyze the significance of the groups of input variables. Using the design of a programmable material system (PMS) as an example, we demonstrate the use of our approach for examining the impact of material, architecture, and stimulus variables as well as their interactions. This information lays the foundation for managing design space complexity, summarizing the relationships between system components, and deriving design guidelines for PMS development.

ID DECOMPOSITION
AB Belgium exhibits a rather constant level of income inequality during the last decades, contrary to Germany, the United States and some Nordic countries, which have all faced substantial increases in inequality. We use the available income surveys from 1985 to 2020 to describe the evolution of income inequality by means of the Gini index. Earnings inequality has slightly decreased in the last two decades, at least if one takes into account the impact of the substantial increase in employment of, especially, older people and women. Though the education gap in earnings is widening, the rapid increase in (mostly female) education may have a dampening effect on earnings inequality. The income surveys largely underestimate financial capital incomes. Moreover, by definition, these do not cover undistributed profits of the corporate sector. When correcting for this, it turns out that pre-tax factor income inequality increased substantially between 2009 and 2016. The redistributive role of the welfare state through taxes has increased, while redistribution through the social security system exhibited a more irregular course. While there has been an increase in assortative matching in the last two decades, its impact on the evolution of income inequality is unclear.

AB Observations in various applications are frequently represented as a time series of multidimensional arrays, called tensor time series, preserving the inherent multidimensional structure. In this paper, we present a factor model approach, in a form similar to tensor CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition, to the analysis of high-dimensional dynamic tensor time series. As the loading vectors are uniquely defined but not necessarily orthogonal, it is significantly different from the existing tensor factor models based on Tucker-type tensor decomposition. The model structure allows for a set of uncorrelated one-dimensional latent dynamic factor processes, making it much more convenient to study the underlying dynamics of the time series. A new high-order projection estimator is proposed for such a factor model, utilizing the special structure and the idea of the higher order orthogonal iteration procedures commonly used in Tucker-type tensor factor model and general tensor CP decomposition procedures. Theoretical investigation provides statistical error bounds for the proposed methods, which shows the significant advantage of utilizing the special model structure. Simulation study is conducted to further demonstrate the finite sample properties of the estimators. Real data application is used to illustrate the model and its interpretations.

AB The hippocampus is a crucial brain structure involved in memory formation, spatial navigation, emotional regulation, and learning. An accurate MRI image segmentation of the human hippocampus plays an important role in multiple neuro-imaging research and clinical practice, such as diagnosing neurological diseases and guiding surgical interventions. While most hippocampus segmentation studies focus on using T1-weighted or T2-weighted MRI scans, we explore the use of diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI), which offers unique insights into the microstructural properties of the hippocampus. Particularly, we utilize various anisotropy measures derived from diffusion MRI (dMRI), including fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity, for a multi-contrast deep learning approach to hippocampus segmentation. To exploit the unique benefits offered by various contrasts in dMRI images for accurate hippocampus segmentation, we introduce an innovative multimodal deep learning architecture integrating cross-attention mechanisms. Our proposed framework comprises a multi-head encoder designed to transform each contrast of dMRI images into distinct latent spaces, generating separate image feature maps. Subsequently, we employ a gated cross-attention unit following the encoder, which facilitates the creation of attention maps between every pair of image contrasts. These attention maps serve to enrich the feature maps, thereby enhancing their effectiveness for the segmentation task. In the final stage, a decoder is employed to produce segmentation predictions utilizing the attention-enhanced feature maps. The experimental outcomes demonstrate the efficacy of our framework in hippocampus segmentation and highlight the benefits of using multi-contrast images over single-contrast images in diffusion MRI image segmentation.

AB The thermal decomposition mechanism of hydroxyacetone from 850 to 1390 K was examined by using flash pyrolysis vacuum ultraviolet photoionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry combined with density functional theory calculation. The results showed that keto-enol tautomerisms could occur prior to the thermal decomposition of hydroxyacetone. The decomposition pathways of hydroxyacetone and its isomer, 2-hydroxypropanal were characterized. The thermal decomposition reactions started at about 950 K. The homolysis reactions related to the cleavage of the C-CO-C-COH bond of hydroxyacetone and 2-hydroxypropanal, as well as CH3 loss of hydroxyacetone, dominated the initial decomposition reactions. The subsequent decompositions of the radical intermediates generated by the initial homolysis decompositions were the major secondary decomposition reactions. The formation pathways of small molecules, such as H-2, CH4, H2O, and HCHO, were proposed to proceed via molecular elimination reactions facilitated by the active alpha-H atoms. These elimination reactions were not negligible at high temperatures above 1230 K.

AB Recent studies have demonstrated the ability to switch weakly coupled interlayer magnetic orders by using electric polarization in insulating van der Waals heterostructures. However, controlling strongly coupled intralayer magnetic orders remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose that frustrated multiferroic heterostructures can exhibit enhanced intralayer magnetoelectric coupling. Through first-principles calculations, we have investigated a heterostructure composed of MnBr2 and Nb3I8, wherein there is a competition between frustrated intralayer magnetic orders within the MnBr2 and interlayer magnetic coupling via a unique spin-local field effect. As a result, manipulating the vertical electric polarization of the Nb3I8 layer successfully controls the ground-state intralayer magnetic order in the frustrated MnBr2 layer, inducing transitions between zigzag antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic orders. Our findings offer a novel approach to controlling intralayer spin structures, paving the way for advancements in spintronic applications in a single atomic layer, which cannot be achieved by interlayer magnetoelectric coupling.

AB Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), that consist of two ferromagnetic electrodes separated by an insulating barrier layer, have non-trivial fundamental properties associated with spin-dependent tunneling. Especially interesting are fully crystalline MTJs where spin-dependent tunneling is controlled by the symmetry group of wave vector. In this work, using first-principles quantum-transport calculations, we explore spin-dependent tunneling in fully crystalline SrRuO3/SrTiO3/SrRuO3 (001) MTJs and predict tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) of nearly 3000%. We demonstrate that this giant TMR effect is driven by symmetry matching (mismatching) of the incoming and outcoming Bloch states in the SrRuO3 (001) electrodes and evanescent states in the SrTiO3 (001) barrier. We argue that under the conditions of symmetry-controlled transport, spin polarization, whatever definition is used, is not a relevant measure of spin-dependent tunneling. In the presence of diffuse scattering, however, e.g. due to localized states in the band gap of the tunnel barrier, symmetry matching is no longer valid and TMR in SrRuO3/SrTiO3/SrRuO3 (001) MTJs is strongly reduced. Under these conditions, the spin polarization of the interface transmission function becomes a valid measure of TMR. These results provide an important insight into understanding and optimizing TMR in all-oxide MTJs.

AB Friction and wear collectively account for nearly a quarter of the world's energy consumption, resulting in over eight Gigatons of CO2 emissions annually. With increasing mobility and industrial activity, the adverse effects of friction and wear on energy, the environment, the global economy, and sustainability will undoubtedly intensify. Unless we reverse this unsustainable trend, our planet could face a major ecological and environmental catastrophe. Fortunately, significant strides have been made in reducing friction to almost undetectable levels, with friction coefficients below 0.001. These remarkable achievements have resulted from numerous collaborative efforts and global initiatives focused on developing novel materials, surfaces, and interfaces that exhibit minimal or near zero friction, even at macro or engineering scales. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the factors that contribute to and hinder superlubric sliding conditions, examining the impact of both intrinsic and extrinsic factors that are integral parts of the test conditions and environments. Drawing from recent analytical, experimental, and computational findings, underlying mechanisms most responsible for superlubricity are also discussed. The paper discusses recent mechanistic studies on highly ordered 2D materials, such as graphene, MoS2, h-BN, MXene, etc., and thin solid coatings such as diamond-like carbon or DLCs, as well as liquids, and discusses their potential for the development of large-scale mechanical systems. These exciting advancements pave the way for designing and producing next-generation engineering systems that can minimize friction in practical applications, thus conserving energy, enhancing durability, and protecting the environment for a sustainable future.

AB Mammalia comprises a great diversity of diet types and associated adaptations. An understanding of the genomic mechanisms underlying these adaptations may offer insights for improving human health. Comparative genomic studies of diet that employ taxonomically restricted analyses or simplified diet classifications may suffer reduced power to detect molecular convergence associated with diet evolution. Here, we use a quantitative carnivory score-indicative of the amount of animal protein in the diet-for 80 mammalian species to detect significant correlations between the relative evolutionary rates of genes and changes in diet. We have identified six genes-ACADSB, CLDN16, CPB1, PNLIP, SLC13A2, and SLC14A2-that experienced significant changes in evolutionary constraint alongside changes in carnivory score, becoming less constrained in lineages evolving more herbivorous diets. We further consider the biological functions associated with diet evolution and observe that pathways related to amino acid and lipid metabolism, biological oxidation, and small molecule transport experienced reduced purifying selection as lineages became more herbivorous. Liver and kidney functions show similar patterns of constraint with dietary change. Our results indicate that these functions are important for the consumption of animal matter and become less important with the evolution of increasing herbivory. So, genes expressed in these tissues experience a relaxation of evolutionary constraint in more herbivorous lineages.

ID GENERATION; IMPLEMENTATION
AB A complete suite of algorithms to implement parallel assembly of sparse finite element matrices on multicore computers is presented. The approach is broken down into six algorithms. The goal is to cater both to nonlinear computations, where it is possible to amortize sequential algorithms over multiple assembly passes, and linear computations, where sequential algorithms cannot be amortized. Therefore, we consider the entire process, starting with the mesh, and finishing with the sparse matrix in the compressed column format, in order to compare meaningfully parallel and sequential implementations. Importantly, the entire construction of the sparse matrix is parallelized. Numerical experiments are carried out on five distinct multicore computers (including A64FX and Nvidia Grace systems) with up to 144 cores, and the results indicate that decent scaling can be obtained up to 48 computing threads. The algorithms are described in the programming language Julia, and their complete source code is available on Github.

AB In this article we propose a theoretical investigation of the nonlinear dynamical response of a class of planar resonators dubbed the V-Shaped resonator. The resonators are intended for energy harvesting purpose and are designed to exhibit two-to-one internal resonance. In particular, we navigate the design space for the generalized V-shaped resonator to investigate the influence of shape parameters on the performance of the Vibration Energy Harvester. Notably, we introduce two metrics that help elucidating the role of the shape parameter in dictating the behavior of the system in terms of peak voltage and operational bandwidth width. For simplicity, we consider that the system is subjected to harmonic excitations near its primary resonances.

AB Ultraviolet photodissociation dynamics of 2-methylallyl radical from the 3p Rydberg state were investigated in the wavelength region of 226-244 nm using the high-n Rydberg atom time-of-flight (HRTOF) technique. The 2-methylallyl radicals were generated by 193 nm photolysis of 3-chloro-2-methyl-1-propene precursors. The photofragment yield spectrum of H-atom products increases in intensity with decreasing wavelengths in 226-244 nm. The TOF spectra of H-atom products show a bimodal structure. The predominant product channel (with similar to 98% branching ratio) has a kinetic energy release peaking at similar to 7 kcal/mol, with an average ratio of E-T in the total available energy, (f(T)), of similar to 0.18 in 226-244 nm and an isotropic product angular distribution. At the low E-T, isotropic component is from statistical unimolecular decomposition of highly vibrationally excited hot 2-methylallyl to the methylenecyclopropane+H products, following internal conversion from the excited electronic state. The minor product channel (with similar to 2% branching ratio) has a large kinetic energy peaking at similar to 50 kcal/mol, with (f(T))approximate to 0.63 and an anisotropic angular distribution (beta approximate to-0.2). At the high E-T, anisotropic component is non-statistical and is postulated to be from direct loss of H atom via the 3p Rydberg state or repulsive part of the ground state to the 1,3-butadiene+H products.

TI Interacting light thermal-relic dark matter: Self-consistent

ID PARTICLES; MASS; CONSTRAINTS; ABUNDANCES; CANDIDATES
AB We analyze cosmic microwave background (CMB) data to constrain the mass and interaction strengths of thermally-produced dark matter (DM) in a self-consistent manner, simultaneously taking into account the cosmological effects of its mass and interactions. The presence of a light thermal-relic particle contributes non-negligibly to the radiation density during big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), altering the light-element yields, as well as the effective number of relativistic particle species. On the other hand, DM interactions with the Standard Model can affect distribution of matter in later universe. Both mass and interactions alter CMB anisotropy on subdegree scales. To understand and quantify the interplay of these effects, we consider elastic DM-baryon scattering with a momentum-transfer cross section that scales as a power law of the relative velocity between the scattering particles. In the range of thermal-relic DM masses relevant for BBN (less than or similar to 20 MeV), we find that the reconstruction of the DM mass and the scattering cross section from the CMB data features strong degeneracies; modeling the two effects simultaneously increases the sensitivity of the CMB measurements to both fundamental properties of DM. Additionally, we study the effects of late-time residual annihilation of a light thermal relic and provide improved CMB constraints on the DM mass and annihilation cross section. To examine degeneracy between DM mass, cross section for elastic scattering with baryons, and annihilation cross section, we consider a specific case of DM with electric and magnetic dipole moments. We present new self-consistent cosmological bounds for this model and discuss implications for future searches.

AB Photochemical processes are often thought to be temperature-independent. However, photochemical polymerization involves photochemical processes such as light-driven radical generation coupled with thermal-driven reactions such as monomer propagation. The apparent activation energy of propagation, E A(R p), of a series of three monomers, methyl acrylate (MA), methyl methacrylate (MMA), and styrene (STY), are deduced from Arrhenius analysis of conventional and RAFT photopolymerization of these monomers across a range of corresponding temperatures. The deduced E A(R p) was compared with the benchmarked E A(k p) derived from pulse laser polymerizations coupled with size exclusion chromatography (PLP-SEC). For conventional photopolymerization of MA, MMA and STY, the relatively small discrepancy between the photopolymerization-derived E A(R p) and the E A(k p) from PLP-SEC was rationalized due to temperature-induced changes in termination. The deviation between the E A(R p) measured in RAFT photopolymerization and E A(k p) from PLP-SEC depends on the retardation strength in RAFT polymerizations. MMA and STY monomers are characterized with minimal retardation and recorded excellent agreement in PLP-SEC and RAFT-derived E p values. However, the RAFT photopolymerization of MA, which is subject to strong retardation, had a much larger E A(R p) than the E A(k p) from PLP-SEC. The high apparent E A(R p) in RAFT polymerization of MA is likely due to the added influence of temperature-induced changes in the RAFT equilibrium. Overall, these results rationalize temperature-dependent effects in photochemical reactions.

AB Deep learning (DL) training or retraining on an edge computing network is promising due to its local computation advantage over the cloud. Data and model parallel DL training is a solution to handle the challenges of the large and increasing scale of deep neural network (DNN) models and resource constraints of edge devices. However, its training accuracy by a certain time will be greatly affected or the training process will slow down if one model partition experiences faults due to causes such as edge node mobility, resource unavailability and hardware errors. Though task replication strategies have been used in wireless networks or the TensorFlow machine learning framework, they cannot handle DL job unique features (i.e., large amounts of intermediate results, high accuracy requirement and DL job dataflow) in such DL training. To address this problem, we propose a proactive Fault Tolerant data and model parallel DL system at the Edge (FTLE) to improve DL training time and accuracy by a certain time. FTLE proactively calculates and predicts the fault probability of each model partition using a DL method. It then decides the number of replicas of each partition based on its fault probability, its significance on the accuracy and its importance in the DL job dataflow. Then, FTLE assigns the replicas to edge devices, and schedules a replica to run before each predicted fault occurs based on the DL job dataflow in order to reduce training time and replication time overhead. Our trace-driven experiment on real devices shows that for one epoch training, FTLE shows around 59% reduction in training time, 45% increase in accuracy, and 65% reduction in replication overhead compared to other methods.

AB Membrane-embedded mechanosensitive (MS) proteins, including ion channels and G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), are essential for the transduction of external mechanical stimuli into biological signals. The angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor plays many important roles in cardiovascular regulation and is associated with diseases such as hypertension and congestive heart failure. The membrane-mediated activation of the AT1 receptor is not well understood, despite this being one of the most widely studied GPCRs within the context of biased agonism. Here, we use extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to characterize the effect of the local membrane environment on the activation of the AT1 receptor. We show that membrane thickness plays an important role in the stability of active and inactive states of the receptor, as well as the dynamic interchange between states. Furthermore, our simulation results show that membrane tension is effective in driving large-scale structural changes in the inactive state such as the outward movement of transmembrane helix 6 to stabilize intermediate active-like conformations. We conclude by comparing our simulation observations with AlphaFold 2 predictions, as a proxy to experimental structures, to provide a framework for how membrane mediated stimuli can facilitate activation of the AT1 receptor through the beta-arrestin signaling pathway.

AB This paper offers a strategic approach to Electric Vehicles (EVs) charging network planning, emphasizing the integration of demand and supply dynamics. This is accomplished through the utilization of continuous-time fluid queue models alongside discrete flow refueling location modeling, all in the context of innovation diffusion principles. Firstly, we employ a continuoustime approximation based on Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) to design multi-year supply curves, a method that stands in contrast to conventional practices which often overlook interyear transitions and ongoing processes. Then, for medium-term charging station location planning (CSLP), we apply a flow refueling location model (FRLM) within grid-based multi-level networks, considering both multiple-path networks and capacity constraints. Furthermore, the grid-based network planning strategy uses a three-tier (Macro-Meso-Micro) approach for thorough EV charging station placement, with the macro-level covering entire cities, the meso-level assessing detailed EV routes and bridging the macro to micro levels, and the micro-level focusing on precise station placement for accessibility and efficiency. Lastly, our exploration of both overutilization and underutilization scenarios provides valuable insights for policymaking and conducting cost-benefit analyses. Illustrating our approach with the example of the Chicago sketch network, we introduce an integrated demand-supply model suitable for a single region and extendable to multiple regions, thereby addressing a gap in the existing literature. Our proposed methodology focuses on EV station placement, taking into account future needs, geographical capacities, and the importance of scenario analysis, which empowers strategic resource planning for EV charging networks over extended timeframes, thus aiding the transition towards a more sustainable and efficient transportation system.

AB In this paper, we announce the public release of a massively parallel, graphics processing unit (GPU)-accelerated software, which is the first to combine both coarse-grained particle simulations and field-theoretic simulations in one simulation package. MATILDA.FT (Mesoscale, Accelerated, Theoretically Informed, Langevin, Dissipative particle dynamics, and Field Theory) was designed from the ground-up to run on CUDA-enabled GPUs with Thrust library acceleration, enabling it to harness the possibility of massive parallelism to efficiently simulate systems on a mesoscopic scale. It has been used to model a variety of systems, from polymer solutions and nanoparticle-polymer interfaces to coarse-grained peptide models and liquid crystals. MATILDA.FT is written in CUDA/C++ and is object oriented, making its source-code easy to understand and extend. Here, we present an overview of the currently available features, and the logic of parallel algorithms and methods. We provide the necessary theoretical background and present examples of systems simulated using MATILDA.FT as the simulation engine. The source code, along with the documentation, additional tools, and examples, can be found on the GitHub MATILDA.FT repository.

AB Kirigami is defined as the ancient Japanese art of cutting and folding paper to create three-dimensional structures, which is a subset of the larger term. Recent developments in kirigami-based structures have sparked interest in the engineering community for the development of mechanical metastructures with customized behavior such as negative Poisson's ratio, out-of-plane buckling, and soft robot locomotion. In this manuscript, nonlinear springs based on kirigami are developed; the springs can be used to create customized nonlinear oscillators and vibration suppression systems. A Helmholtz-Duffing oscillator with nonlinear damping is created by attaching a mass to a smooth track with the kirigami springs attached to it.
   Kirigami springs were made by strategically cutting plastic sheets in predetermined patterns and arranging them in a ring. Identification of the unknown system parameters is accomplished through the use of a two-step procedure. To determine the quasi-static behavior of the spring, it was first subjected to tensile testing. These parameters serve as the foundation for developing a strategy for determining the unknown energy loss parameters in a system. In the second step, the Method of Multiple Scales is used to develop an approximate solution for the transient response, which is then tested. This solution is coupled with an optimization routine that, by modifying the unknown model parameters, seeks to reduce the error between the experimental free oscillations and the developed analytical solution as closely as possible.

Primary and secondary amines bearing a variety of different functional groups including amino acids, cyclic amines, and nucleosides were prepared. The desired amines were synthesized under mild conditions. The influence of the CF3SF4-group on the pKa and log D of a standard amine was established. The unusual conformation of the trans-CF3SF4-substituted tosylate has been verified via its crystal structure.

AB The associative theory of creativity has long held that creative thinking involves connecting remote concepts in semantic memory. Network science tools have recently been applied to map the organization of concepts in semantic memory, and to study the link between semantic memory and creativity. Yet such work has largely overlooked the domain of convergent thinking, despite the theoretical importance of semantic memory networks for facilitating associative processes relevant for convergent problem solving (e.g., spreading activation). Convergent thinking problems, such as the Compound Remote Associates (CRA) test, can be solved with insight (the sudden "aha" experience) or analysis (deliberately and incrementally working towards the solution). In a sample of 477 participants, we adopted network science methods to compare semantic memory structure across two grouping variables: 1) convergent thinking ability (i.e., CRA accuracy), and 2) the self-reported tendency to solve problems with insight or analysis. Semantic memory networks were constructed from a semantic fluency task, and problem solving style (insight or analysis) was determined from judgments provided during solving of CRAs. We found that, compared to the low-convergent thinking group, the high-convergent thinking group exhibited a more flexible and interconnected semantic network-with short paths and many connections between concepts. Moreover, participants who primarily solved problems with insight (compared to analysis) showed shorter average path distances between concepts, even after controlling for accuracy. Our results extend the literature on semantic memory and creativity, and suggest that the organization of semantic memory plays a key role in convergent thinking, including insight problem solving.

AB We propose an analytic dual-cone accretion model for horizon-scale images of the cores of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei, including those observed by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). Our model is of synchrotron emission from an axisymmetric, magnetized plasma, constrained to flow within two oppositely oriented cones that are aligned with the black hole's spin axis. We show this model can accurately reproduce images of a variety of time-averaged general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations and that it accurately recovers the black hole spin, orientation, emission scale height, peak emission radius, and fluid flow direction from these simulations within a Bayesian inference framework using radio interferometric data. We show that nontrivial topologies in the images of relativistic accretion flows around black holes can result in nontrivial multimodal solutions when applied to observations with a sparse array, such as the EHT 2017 observations of M87*. The presence of these degeneracies underscores the importance of employing Bayesian techniques to adequately sample the posterior space for the interpretation of EHT measurements. We fit our model to the EHT observations of M87* and find a 95% highest posterior density interval for the mass-to-distance ratio of theta g is an element of (2.84, 3.75) mu as, and give an inclination of theta o is an element of (11 degrees, 24 degrees). These new measurements are consistent with mass measurements from the EHT and stellar dynamical estimates and with the spin axis inclination inferred from properties of the M87* jet.

AB Microbial communities are the primary drivers of carbon cycling in the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica. Dense microbial mats, consisting mainly of photosynthetic cyanobacteria, occupy aquatic areas associated with streams and lakes. Other microbial communities also occur at lower densities as patchy surface biological soil crusts (hereafter, biocrusts) across the terrestrial landscape. Multispectral satellite data have been used to model microbial mat abundance in high-density areas like stream and lake margins, but no previous studies have investigated the lower detection limits of biocrusts. Here, we describe remote sensing and field-based survey and sampling approaches to study the detectability and distribution of biocrusts in the McMurdo Dry Valleys. Using a combination of multi- and hyperspectral tools and spectral linear unmixing, we modeled the abundances of biocrust in eastern Taylor Valley. Our spectral approaches can detect low masses of biocrust material in laboratory microcosms down to biocrust concentrations of 1% by mass. These techniques also distinguish the spectra of biocrust from both surface rock and mineral signatures from orbit. We found that biocrusts are present throughout the soils of eastern Taylor Valley and are associated with diverse underlying soil communities. The densest biocrust communities identified in this study had total organic carbon 5x greater than the content of typical arid soils. The most productive biocrusts were located downslope of melting snowpacks in unique soil ecosystems that are distinct from the surrounding arid landscape. There are similarities between the snowpack and stream sediment communities (high diversity of soil invertebrates) as well as their ecosystem properties (e.g., persistence of liquid water, high transfer of available nutrients, lower salinity from flushing) compared to the typical arid terrestrial ecosystem of the dry valleys. Our approach extends the capability of orbital remote sensing of photosynthetic communities out of the aquatic margins and into the drier soils which comprise most of this landscape. This interdisciplinary work is critical for measuring and monitoring terrestrial carbon stocks and predicting future ecosystem dynamics in this currently water-limited but increasingly dynamic Antarctic landscape, which is particularly climate-sensitive and difficult to access.

ID MONTE-CARLO RENORMALIZATION; COUPLING PARAMETERS
AB We develop a machine-learning renormalization group (MLRG) algorithm to explore and analyze many-body lattice models in statistical physics. Using the representation learning capability of generative modeling, MLRG automatically learns the optimal renormalization group (RG) transformations from self-generated spin configurations and formulates RG equations without human supervision. The algorithm does not focus on simulating any particular lattice model but broadly explores all possible models compatible with the internal and lattice symmetries given the on-site symmetry representation. It can uncover the RG monotone that governs the RG flow, assuming a strong form of the c-theorem. This enables several downstream tasks, including unsupervised classification of phases, automatic location of phase transitions or critical points, controlled estimation of critical exponents, and operator scaling dimensions. We demonstrate the MLRG method in two-dimensional lattice models with Ising symmetry and show that the algorithm correctly identifies and characterizes the Ising criticality.

AB Environmental damage caused by waste plastics and downstream chemical breakdown products is a modern crisis. Endocrine-disrupting bisphenol A (BPA), found in breakdown products of poly(bisphenol A carbonate) (PC), is an especially pernicious example that interferes with the reproduction and development of a wide range of organisms, including humans. Herein we report a single-stage thiocracking method to chemically upcycle polycarbonate using elemental sulfur, a waste product of fossil fuel refining. Importantly, this method disintegrates bisphenol A units into monoaryls, thus eliminating endocrine disrupting BPA from the material and from any potential downstream waste. Thiocracking of PC (10 wt%) with elemental sulfur (90 wt%) at 320 degrees C yields the highly crosslinked network SPC90. The composition, thermal, morphological, and mechanical properties of SPC90 were characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy, TGA, DSC, elemental analysis, SEM/EDX, compressive strength tests, and flexural strength tests. The composite SPC90 (compressive strength = 12.8 MPa, flexural strength = 4.33 MPa) showed mechanical strengths exceeding those of commercial bricks and competitive with those of mineral cements. The approach discussed herein represents a method to chemically upcycle polycarbonate while deconstructing BPA units, and valorizing waste sulfur to yield structurally viable building materials that could replace less-green legacy materials.

AB The intrinsic biomechanical characteristic of the human upper limb plays a central role in absorbing the interactive energy during physical human-robot interaction (pHRI). We have recently shown that based on the concept of "Excess of Passivity (EoP)," from nonlinear control theory, it is possible to decode such energetic behavior for both upper and lower limbs [1], [2]. The extracted knowledge can be used in the design of controllers (such as [2]-[5]) for optimizing the transparency and fidelity of force fields in human-robot interaction and in haptic systems. In this paper, for the first time, we investigate the frequency behavior of the passivity map for the upper limb when the muscle co-activation was controlled in real-time through visual electromyographic feedback. Five healthy subjects (age: 27 +/- 5) were included in this study. The energetic behavior was evaluated at two stimulation frequencies at eight interaction directions over two controlled muscle co-activation levels. Electromyography (EMG) was captured using the Delsys Wireless Trigno system. Results showed a correlation between EMG and EoP, which was further amplified by decreasing the frequency. The proposed energetic behavior is named the Geometric MyoPassivity (GMP) map. The findings indicate that the GMP map has the potential to be used in real-time to quantify the absorbable energy, thus passivity margin of stability for upper limb interaction during pHRI.

AB Cellular base stations for 5G/6G networks, as well as satellites and long-range radar for commercial, aerospace, and defense systems all demandpower amplifiers(PAs) with high output power density and high efficiency. While silicon (Si), silicon germanium (SiGe), and gallium arsenide (GaAs) technologies are well established, it is now impossible to overlook gallium nitride (GaN) in applications where maximizing output power with minimal footprint is paramount. Backed by its deployment for solid-state lighting, power converters, and PAs, GaN technology has seen tremendous advancements in the last 20-30 years. The principal device for microwave and millimeter-wave (mm-wave) applications is the AlGaN/GaN high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT), which is most commonly fabricated on either silicon carbide (SiC) or Si substrates. AlGaN/GaN HEMTs with an output power density of 40 W/mm [1] have been reported up to the X band, while highly scaled transistors with f(t)/f(MAX) of >450 GHz have also been achieved [2]. In the last decade, a new wave of innovations has also emerged, such as the replacement of AlGaN barriers with scandium aluminum nitride (ScAlN) and the development of N-polar GaN technology with 8-W/mm power density at 94 GHz [3].

AB Small-scale fisheries provide seafood for billions of people and are one of the largest employers in many coastal communities. Those households engaged in these fisheries who maintain diverse income sources are generally thought to be better prepared to cope with social or ecological perturbations such as the crises presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. One outcome of the COVID-19 crisis was the collapse of international tourism after many nations instituted strict border controls to slow the virus's spread, severely impacting coastal communities that depend on tourism-related employment. This research assessed the effects of COVID-19-induced collapse of tourism on small-scale coral reef fishers and households in Moorea, French Polynesia. Ninety-five households were surveyed about their livelihoods, fishing, demographics, and income-generating occupations before and after the lockdown. Shifts in fish biomass were evaluated using time series data collected through underwater visual surveys, and roadside fish vendors were surveyed to assess fish sales. Results showed that after tourism employment evaporated more Moorea households began fishing to boost their incomes and food security. However, the increase in fishing pressure showed no appreciable decline in the biomass of fishable species. The households responsible for the increased fishing activities were those who were working in the tourism economy prior to the pandemic and subsequently lost their jobs. Households that combined fishing with construction or other stable sectors showed greater abilities to cope, while those combining fishing with tourism were heavily impacted. Importantly, results showed that those households devoted solely to fishing managed the crisis adeptly due to their superior fishing skills and ecological knowledge. This pattern suggests that not all forms of household livelihood diversification confer equal advantages and that resource-dependent households are not necessarily intrinsically less resilient. More generally, it is argued that we should be cautious when promoting livelihood diversification as a blanket solution to decrease household vulnerability, and that ecological knowledge diversity is underappreciated.

AB Statistical learning (SL) is the ability to rapidly track statistical regularities and learn patterns in the environment. Recent studies show that SL is constrained by domain-specific features, rather than being a uniform learning mechanism across domains and modalities. This domain- specificity has been reflected at the neural level, as SL occurs in regions primarily involved in processing of specific modalities or domains of input. However, our understanding of how SL is constrained by domain-specific features in the developing brain is severely lacking. The present study aims to identify the functional neural profiles of auditory SL of linguistic and nonlinguistic regularities among children. Thirty children between 5 and 7 years old completed an auditory fMRI SL task containing interwoven sequences of structured and random syllable/tone sequences. Using traditional group univariate analyses and a group- constrained subject-specific analysis, frontal and temporal cortices showed significant activation when processing structured versus random sequences across both linguistic and nonlinguistic domains. However, conjunction analyses failed to identify overlapping neural indices across domains. These findings are the first to compare brain regions supporting SL of linguistic and nonlinguistic regularities in the developing brain and indicate that auditory SL among developing children may be constrained by domain-specific features.

ID STRING SIMILARITY JOINS; EFFICIENT ALGORITHM; FRAMEWORK
AB String matching is at the core of data cleaning, record matching, and information retrieval. String matching relies on a similarity measure that evaluates the similarity of two strings, regarding the two as a match if their similarity is larger than a user-defined threshold. In our collaboration with journalists and public defenders, we found that real-world datasets, such as police rosters that journalists and public defenders work with, often contain acronyms, abbreviations, and typos, thanks to errors during manual entry, into, say, a spreadsheet or a form. Unfortunately, traditional similarity measures lead to low accuracy since they do not consider all three aspects together. Some recent work proposes leveraging synonym rules to improve matching, but either requires these rules to be provided upfront, or generated prior to matching, which leads to low accuracy in our setting and similar ones. To address these limitations, we propose SMASH, a simple yet effective measure to assess the similarity of two strings with acronyms, abbreviations, and typos, all without relying on synonym rules. We design a dynamic programming algorithm to efficiently compute this measure, along with two optimizations that improve accuracy. We show that compared to the best baselines, including one based on ChatGPT with GPT-4, SMASH improves the max and mean F-score by 23.5% and 110.8%, respectively. We implement SMASH in OpenRefine, a graphical data cleaning tool, to facilitate its use by journalists, public defenders, and other non-programmers for data cleaning.

AB The pharmaceutical industry has experienced a remarkable increase in the use of subcutaneous injection of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), attributed mainly to its advantages in reducing healthcare-related costs and enhancing patient compliance. Despite this growth, there is a limited understanding of how tissue mechanics, physiological parameters, and different injection devices and techniques influence the transport and absorption of the drug. In this work, we propose a high-fidelity computational model to study drug transport and absorption during and after subcutaneous injection of mAbs. Our numerical model includes large-deformation mechanics, fluid flow, drug transport, and blood and lymphatic uptake. Through this computational framework, we analyze the tissue material responses, plume dynamics, and drug absorption. We analyze different devices, injection techniques, and physiological parameters such as BMI, flow rate, and injection depth. Finally, we compare our numerical results against the experimental data from the literature.

AB This work demonstrates vertical Ga2O3 Schot-tky barrier diodes (SBDs) with a novel junction termination extension (JTE) comprising multiple layers of sputtered p-type nickel oxide (NiO). The NiO layers have the varied lengths to enable a graded decrease in effective charge density away from the main junction. The fabrication of this JTE obviates the etch or implantation and shows good throughput. The fabricated Ga2O3 SBDs exhibit a forward voltage below 1.9 V at the current density of 100 A/cm2, a differential specific on-resistance of 5.9 m(2). cm(2), and a breakdown voltage over 2.5 kV. The Baliga's figure of merit (FOM) exceeds 1 GW/cm(2 )and is among the highest in multi-kilovolt Ga2O3 SBDs. Besides, the capacitance of the JTE region is extracted, allowing for evaluation of the capacitance, charge, and switching FOM of 1.7 kV-class Ga2O3 SBDs with varied current ratings. The results show good promise of Ga2O3 SBDs for kilovolt power electronics.

SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY

DT Article
ID HYDROGEN EVOLUTION; PLATINUM; MERCURY
AB The classical theory of the electrical double layer (EDL) does not consider the effects of the electrode surface structure on the EDL properties. Moreover, the best agreement between the traditional EDL theory and experiments has been achieved so far only for a very limited number of ideal systems, such as liquid metal mercury electrodes, for which it is challenging to operate with specific surface structures. In the case of solid electrodes, the predictive power of classical theory is often not acceptable for electrochemical energy applications, e.g., in supercapacitors, due to the effects of surface structure, electrode composition, and complex electrolyte contributions. In this work, we combine ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations and electrochemical experiments to elucidate the relationship between the structure of Pt(hkl) surfaces and the double-layer capacitance as a key property of the EDL. Flat, stepped, and kinked Pt single crystal facets in contact with acidic HClO4 media are selected as our model systems. We demonstrate that introducing specific defects, such as steps, can substantially reduce the EDL capacitances close to the potential of zero charge (PZC). Our AIMD simulations reveal that different Pt facets are characterized by different net orientations of the water dipole moment at the interface. That allows us to rationalize the experimentally measured (inverse) volcano-shaped capacitance as a function of the surface step density.

AB The weakly bound complexes of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and water have been analyzed using a combination of computational methods and matrix isolation FTIR spectroscopy. The computational analysis utilized density functional and perturbation theory methods to determine the lowest energy geometries and vibrational frequencies of NMP: H2O. This analysis yielded four unique structures that could be differentiated by their preferred intermolecular interaction. Two structures formed via relatively strong OH & ctdot;O hydrogen bonds, one structure was stabilized via OH & ctdot;N interactions, and the fourth structure was observed to interact through relatively weak CH & ctdot;O features. The interaction motifs were verified using atoms in molecules analysis and the noncovalent interaction index method. Spectra of NMP with H2O and its isotopologues showed clear evidence of two unique structures in the cryogenic nitrogen matrix. Both of these structures formed through OH & ctdot;O interactions from the water to the carbonyl oxygen of NMP. This structural assignment was supported by the calculated vibrational shifts seen in NMP: H2O. A detailed analysis and discussion of this assignment is provided.

AB The glacial meltwater streams in the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDVs), Antarctica only flow during the austral summer and contain abundant algal mats which grow at the onset of flow. Their relative abundance in stream channels of this polar desert make the streams biogeochemical hot spots. The MDVs receive minimal precipitation as snow, which is redistributed by wind and deposited in distinct locations, some of which become persistent snow patches each year. Previous studies identified that MDV streamflow comes from a combination of glacier ice and snow, although snow was assumed to contribute little to the overall water budget. This study uses a combination of satellite imagery, terrain analysis, and field measurements to determine where snow patches accumulate and persist across MDV watersheds, and to quantify the potential hydrologic and biogeochemical contributions of snow patches to streams. Watersheds near the coast have the highest snow-covered area and longest snow persistence. Many of these snow patches accumulate within the stream channels, which results in the potential to contribute to streamflow. During the summer of 2021-2022, stream channel snow patches had the potential to contribute anywhere between <1% and 90% of the total annual discharge in Lake Fryxell Basin streams, and may increase with different hydrometeorological conditions. On average the potential inputs from snow patches to streamflow was between 12% and 25% of the annual discharge during the 2021-2022 season, as determined by snow area and SWE. Snow patches in the majority of the watersheds had higher nitrogen and phosphorous concentrations than stream water, and six streams contained snow with higher N:P ratios than the average N:P in the stream water. This suggests that if such patches melt early in the summer, these nutrient and water inputs could occur at the right time and stoichiometry to be crucial for early season algal mat growth.

TI What Do Halo CMEs Tell Us about Solar Cycle 25?
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS

AB It is known that the weak state of the heliosphere due to diminished solar activity in cycle 24 backreacted on coronal mass ejections (CMEs) to make them appear wider for a given speed. One of the consequences of the weak state of the heliosphere is that more CMEs appear as halo CMEs (HCMEs), and halos are formed at shorter heliocentric distances. Current predictions for the strength of solar cycle (SC) 25 range from half to twice the strength of SC 24. We compare the HCME occurrence rate and other properties during the rise phase of cycles 23, 24, and 25 to weigh in on the strength of SC 25. We find that HCME and solar wind properties in SC 25 are intermediate between SCs 23 and 24, but closer to SC 24. The HCME occurrence rate, normalized to the sunspot number, is higher in SCs 24 and 25 than in SC 23. The solar wind total pressure in SC 25 is & SIM;35% smaller than that in SC 23. Furthermore, the occurrence rates of high-energy solar energetic particle events and intense geomagnetic storms are well below the corresponding values in SC 23, but similar to those in SC 24. We conclude that cycle 25 is likely to be similar to or slightly stronger than cycle 24, in agreement with polar-field precursor methods for cycle 25 prediction.

   METAANALYSIS
AB Wealth-based disparities in health care wherein the poor receive undertreatment in painful conditions are a prominent issue that requires immediate attention. Research with adults suggests that these disparities are partly rooted in stereotypes associating poor individuals with pain insensitivity. However, whether and how children consider a sufferer's wealth status in their pain perceptions remains unknown. The present work addressed this question by testing 4- to 9-year-olds from the US and China. In Study 1 (N = 108, 56 girls, 79% White), US participants saw rich and poor White children experiencing identical injuries and indicated who they thought felt more pain. Although 4- to 6-year-olds responded at chance, children aged seven and above attributed more pain to the poor than to the rich. Study 2 with a new sample of US children (N = 111, 56 girls, 69% White) extended this effect to judgments of White adults' pain. Pain judgments also informed children's prosocial behaviors, leading them to provide medical resources to the poor. Studies 3 (N = 118, 59 girls, 100% Asian) and 4 (N = 80, 40 girls, 100% Asian) found that, when evaluating White and Asian people's suffering, Chinese children began to attribute more pain to the poor than to the rich earlier than US children. Thus, unlike US adults, US children and Chinese children recognize the poor's pain from early on. These findings add to our knowledge of group-based beliefs about pain sensitivity and have broad implications on ways to promote equitable health care.Research HighlightsFour studies examined whether 4- to 9-year-old children's pain perceptions were influenced by sufferers' wealth status.US children attributed more pain to White individuals of low wealth status than those of high wealth status by age seven.Chinese children demonstrated an earlier tendency to attribute more pain to the poor (versus the rich) compared to US children.Children's wealth-based pain judgments underlied their tendency to provide healthcare resources to people of low wealth status.

ID SCATTERING; REDUCTION
AB We report a Tuning Fork Scanning Electrochemical Cell Microscopy (TF-SECCM) technique for providing morphological and electrochemical information on single redox-active entities. This new operation configuration of SECCM utilizes an electrolyte-filled nanopipette tip mounted onto a tuning fork force sensor to obtain a precise tip-sample distance control and surface morphological mapping capabilities. Redox activities of regions of interest (ROIs) can be investigated by scanning electrode potential by moving the nanopipette to any target regions while maintaining the constant force engagement of the tip with the sample. Using silver nanowires (Ag NWs) as a model system due to their extensive utilization in energy and sensing devices, TF-SECCM provides not only the topography of single Ag NWs but also their distinctive redox activities, catalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activities, and electrolyte anion adsorption/desorption features in contrast to NW bundles and a supporting substrate.

ID MODEL; TIDE; VARIABILITY; SHELF
AB The inland propagation of storm surge caused by tropical cyclones depends on large and small waterways to connect the open ocean to inland bays, estuaries, and floodplains. Numerical models for storm surge require these waterways and their surrounding topography to be resolved sufficiently, which can require millions of computational cells for flooding simulations on a large (ocean scale) computational domain, leading to higher demands for computational resources and longer wall-clock times for simulations. Alternatively, the governing shallow water equations can be modified to introduce subgrid corrections that allow coarser and cheaper simulations with comparable accuracy. In this study, subgrid corrections are extended for the first time to simulations at the ocean scale. Higher-level corrections are included for bottom friction and advection, and look-up tables are optimized for large model domains. Via simulations of tides, storm surge, and coastal flooding due to Hurricane Matthew in 2016, the improvements in water level prediction accuracy due to subgrid corrections are evaluated at 218 observation locations throughout 1500 km of coast along the South Atlantic Bight. The accuracy of the subgrid model with relatively coarse spatial resolution (E-RMS = 0.41 m ) is better than that of a conventional model with relatively fine spatial resolution (E-RMS = 0.67 m ). By running on the coarsened subgrid model, we improved the accuracy over efficiency curve for the model, and as a result, the computational expense of the simulation was decreased by a factor of 13.

AB Relations among territoriality, abundance and habitat suitability are fundamental to the ecology of many animal populations. Theory suggests two classes of possible responses to increasing abundance in territorial species: (1) the ideal free distribution (IFD), which predicts smaller territory sizes and decreased fitness as individuals adaptively pack into suitable habitats, and (2) the ideal despotic distribution (IDD), which predicts stable territory sizes and fitness in preferred habitats for dominant individuals and increased use of marginal habitats, reduced fitness and changes in territory sizes for subordinate individuals. We analysed the territory sizes and locations of seven migratory songbird species occupying a 10-ha plot in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire, USA over a 52-year period. Species varied in abundance over years from twofold to 22-fold, and all species displayed clear patterns of habitat preference within the study plot. Consistent with IFD, and contrary to IDD, territory sizes decreased with local abundance for all species, irrespective of habitat preferences. There was at least a twofold variation in territory size within years. Conformity of territory size to predictions of the IFD argues for the efficacy of territorial defence in songbirds and has general consequences for population dynamics.

AB Increased demand for effective energy storage systems emphasizes the urgency to overcome the bottlenecks of existing technology. Supercapacitors (SCs), owing to their high specific power and fast charging/discharging capabilities, are perfect candidates for future energy applications but their low energy density makes them impractical for commercial applications. Because of their high energy density and variable oxidation states, transition metal oxides (TMOs) have great potential as supercapacitor electrode materials. But for practical applications, their poor intrinsic conductivity needs to be improved. Noble metal doping offers a compelling method to raise the conductivity and structural stability of TMOs. Herein, we have prepared AgxMnO2 (x = 0.05, 0.10, and 0.15) to improve the conductivity and structural stability of the electro-active material. FESEM micrographs exhibit cracks on the nanowire (NW) surface by Ag doping, proposing less dead volume. Ag doping also fortified electrode pulverization during charging/discharging cycles by imparting structural stability. These properties enabled Ag0.05MnO2 NWs to demonstrate a specific capacitance of 1027 F g(-1) at a current density of 1 A g(-1). The electrode also retained a capacitance of 93.16% after 10 000 GCD cycles@12 A g(-1) along with 86% rate capability at 9 A g(-1). By tackling critical difficulties such as poor conductivity and structural stability, this study advances energy storage technologies and lays the groundwork for the creation of high-performance supercapacitors for future energy applications.

TI Incorporating simulated spatial context information improves the

ID PRINCIPLES
AB Visual learning often occurs in a specific context, where an agent acquires skills through exploration and tracking of its location in a consistent environment. The historical spatial context of the agent provides a similarity signal for self-supervised contrastive learning. We present a unique approach, termed environmental spatial similarity (ESS), that complements existing contrastive learning methods. Using images from simulated, photorealistic environments as an experimental setting, we demonstrate that ESS outperforms traditional instance discrimination approaches. Moreover, sampling additional data from the same environment substantially improves accuracy and provides new augmentations. ESS allows remarkable proficiency in room classification and spatial prediction tasks, especially in unfamiliar environments. This learning paradigm has the potential to enable rapid visual learning in agents operating in new environments with unique visual characteristics. Potentially transformative applications span from robotics to space exploration. Our proof of concept demonstrates improved efficiency over methods that rely on extensive, disconnected datasets.

AB This work demonstrates a lateral Ga2O3 Schottky barrier diode (SBD) with a breakdown voltage (BV) over 10 kV, the highest BV reported in Ga2O3 devices to date. The 10 kV SBD shows good thermal stability up to 200 degrees C, which is among the highest operational temperatures reported in multi-kilovolt Ga2O3 devices. The key device design for achieving such high BV is a reduced surface field (RESURF) structure based on the p-type nickel oxide (NiO), which balances the depletion charges in the n-Ga2O3 channel at high voltage. At BV, the charge balanced Ga2O3 SBD shows an average lateral electric field (E-field) over 4.7 MV/cm at 25 degrees C and over 3.5 MV/cm at 200 degrees C, both of which exceed the critical E-field of GaN and SiC. The 10 kV SBD shows a specific on-resistance of 0.27 O.cm(2) and a turn-on voltage of 1 V; at 200 degrees C, the former doubles and the latter reduces to 0.7 V. These results suggest the good potential of Ga2O3 devices for medium and high-voltage, high-temperature power applications.

AB We provide a systematic study of the phase diagram and dynamics for single component nanocrystals (NCs) by a combination of a self-consistent mean-field molecular theory (MOLT-CF) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We first compute several thermodynamic functions (free energy, entropy, coefficient of thermal expansion and bulk modulus) as a function of temperature by both MOLT-CF and MD. While MOLT-CF correctly captures the trends with temperature, the predicted coefficients of thermal expansion and bulk moduli display quantitative deviations from MD and experiments, which we trace back to the mean-field treatment of attractions in MOLT-CF. We further characterize the phase diagram and calculate the dependence on temperature of the bcc to fcc transition. Our results reveal that differences in entropic and enthalpic contributions to the free energy oscillate as a function of NC separation and are correlated to a geometric quantity: the volume of overlap between the ligand layers in different particles. In this way, we generally show that bcc is favored by enthalpy, while fcc is by entropy, in agreement with previous experimental evidence of fcc stabilization with increasing temperature, but contrary to what is expected from simpler particle models, where bcc is always entropically favored. We also show that the lowest relaxation times drastically increase in the latest stages of solvent evaporation. Overall, our results demonstrate that MOLT-CF provides an adequate quantitative model describing all phenomenology in single component NCs.

ID ACQUISITION
AB Passive haptic learning (PHL) is a method for training motor skills via intensive repetition of haptic stimuli while a user is focused on other tasks. For the practical application of PHL to music education, we propose passive haptic rehearsal (PHR) where PHL is combined with deliberate active practice. We designed a piano teaching system that includes haptic gloves compatible with daily wear, a Casio keyboard with light-up keys, and an online learning portal that enables users to track performance, choose lessons, and connect with the gloves and keyboard. We conducted a longitudinal two-week study in the wild, where 36 participants with musical experience learned to play two piano songs with and without PHR. For 20 participants with complete and valid data, we found that PHR boosted the learning rate for the matching accuracy by 49.7% but did not have a significant effect on learning the notes' rhythm. Participants across all skill levels in the study require approximately two days less to reach mastery on the songs practiced when using PHR. We also confirmed that PHR boosts recall between active practice sessions. We hope that our results and system will enable the deployment of PHL beyond the laboratory.

AB A computational and spectroscopic analysis of weakly bound complexes of 1:1 gamma-butyrolactone with water has been completed. In this work, multiple density-functional theories and perturbation theory were used to explore the energy-landscape of the complex. Four unique structures were identified in this analysis. One structure was characterized by the formation of a water to carbonyl hydrogen bond and the other three were formed from water to ester hydrogen bonds. The carbonyl-bound conformation was found to be the global minimum across a comprehensive panel of calculations. A wave function analysis demonstrated that the structures were additionally stabilized by weak van der Waals interactions. FTIR spectroscopy of matrix-isolated samples indicated the presence of at least two of the calculated geometries. The structures were identified to be a carbonyl-bound and at least one ester-bound structure. The transitions identified for the carbonyl-bound complex were noted to be significantly more intense than those of the ester bound, indicating greater prevalence in the matrix.

TI Lessons Learned from Catalysis to Qubits: General Strategies to Build
   Accessible and Accurate First-Principles Models of Point Defects
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C

DT Review
ID SPIN
AB Defects and dopants play critical roles in defining the properties of a material. Achieving a mechanistic understanding of how such properties arise is challenging with current experimental methods, and computational approaches suffer from significant modeling limitations that frequently require a posteriori fitting. Consequently, the pace of dopant discovery as a means of tuning material properties for a particular application has been slow. However, recent advances in computation have enabled researchers to move away from semiempirical schemes to reposition density functional theory as a predictive tool and improve the accessibility of highly accurate first-principles methods to all researchers. This Perspective discusses some of these recent achievements that provide more accurate first-principles geometric, thermodynamic, optical, and electronic properties simultaneously. Advancements related to supercells, basis sets, functionals, and optimization protocols, as well as suggestions for evaluating the quality of a computational model through comparison to experimental data, are discussed. Moreover, recent computational results in the fields of energy materials, heterogeneous catalysis, and quantum informatics are reviewed along with an evaluation of current frontiers and opportunities in the field of computational materials chemistry.

AB Coacervation of charged polymer chains has been a topic of major interest in both polymer and biological sciences, as it is a subset of a phenomenon called liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). In this process the polymer-rich phase separates from the polymer-lean supernatant while still maintaining its liquid-like properties. LLPS has been shown to play a crucial role in cellular homeostasis by driving the formation of membraneless organelles. It also has the potential to be harnessed to aid in novel therapeutical applications. Recent studies have demonstrated that there is no one simple mechanism which drives LLPS, which is instead a result of the combined effect of electrostatic, dipolar, hydrophobic, and other weak interactions. Using coarse-grained polymer simulations we investigate the relatively unexplored effects of monomer polarizability and spatially varying dielectric constant on LLPS propensity, and these factors affect the properties of the resulting condensates. In order to produce spatial variations in the dielectric constant, all our simulations include explicit solvent and counterions. We demonstrate that polarizability has only a minor effect on the bulk behaviour of the condensates but plays a major role when ion partitioning and microstructure are considered. We observe that the major contribution comes from the nature of the neutral blocks as endowing them with an induced dipole changes their character from hydrophobic to hydrophilic. We hypothesize that the results of this work can aid in guiding future studies concerned with LLPS by providing a general framework and by highlighting important factors which influence LLPS.
   We show that polarizability plays a significant role in ion partitioning and the development of microstructure in the polymer condensates.

TI Viability of HFO-1234ze(E) (<i>trans</i>-1,3,3,3-tetrafluoropropene) as
   a low global warming potential silicon dioxide etch gas
SO JOURNAL OF VACUUM SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY B

DT Article

AB The American Innovation and Manufacturing Act, enacted by Congress in 2020, grants the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency the authority to phase down the production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), thereby reducing carbon emissions and addressing the negative environmental impact of HFCs. To comply, the semiconductor industry, which uses a variety of processing gases that contain HFCs, must transition to alternative gases in chip manufacturing, particularly in etching processes. Many of the HFC etch gases in current use have high global warming potentials (GWPs). One potential alternative to the high-GWP gases are hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs), which were developed by the refrigerant industry as fourth generation, low-GWP alternatives to legacy refrigerants and foam expansion agents. The present work will investigate the viability of the environmentally friendly HFO, trans-1,3,3,3-tetrafluoropropene [C3H2F4 or HFO-1234ze(E)], as a replacement gas for reactive ion etching of silicon dioxide (SiO2)(.) Initial etch tests demonstrated that HFO-1234ze(E) has higher etch rates and better selectivity than the saturated alkane legacy gases trifluoromethane (CHF3) and difluoromethane (CH2F2). Repeated SiO2 etching with HFO-1234ze(E) appears to not affect the etch chamber or future etch processes. Thus, the present work suggests that the low-GWP HFO-1234ze(E) could be an effective etch gas for the semiconductor industry as an alternative to HFC gases.

AB Benefitted from progress on the large-diameter Ga2O3 wafers and Ga2O3 processing techniques, the Ga2O3 power device technology has witnessed fast advances toward power electronics applications. Recently, reports on large-area (ampere-class) Ga2O3 power devices have emerged globally, and the scope of these works have gone well beyond the bare-die device demonstration into the device packaging, circuit testing, and ruggedness evaluation. These results have placed Ga2O3 in a unique position as the only ultra-wide bandgap semiconductor reaching these indispensable milestones for power device development. This paper presents a timely review on the state-of-the-art of the ampere-class Ga2O3 power devices (current up to >100 A and voltage up to >2000 V), including their static electrical performance, switching characteristics, packaging and thermal management, and the overcurrent/overvoltage ruggedness and reliability. Exciting research opportunities and critical technological gaps are also discussed.

AB X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measures core-electron binding energies (CEBEs) to reveal element-specific insights into the chemical environment and bonding. Accurate theoretical CEBE prediction aids XPS interpretation but requires proper modeling of orbital relaxation and electron correlation upon core-ionization. This work systematically investigates basis set selection for extrapolation to the complete basis set limit of CEBEs from Delta MP2 and Delta CC energies across 94 K-edges in diverse organic molecules. We demonstrate that an alternative composite scheme using Delta MP2 in a large basis corrected by Delta CC-Delta MP2 difference in a small basis can quantitatively recover optimally extrapolated Delta CC CEBEs within 0.02 eV. Unlike Delta CC, MP2 calculations do not suffer from convergence issues and are computationally cheaper, and thus, the composite Delta MP2/Delta CC scheme balances accuracy and cost, overcoming limitations of solely using either method. We conclude by providing a comprehensive analysis of the choice of small and large basis sets for the composite schemes and provide practical recommendations for highly accurate (within 0.10-0.15 eV MAE) ab initio prediction of XPS data.

AB Deploying deep learning models requires taking into consideration neural network metrics such as model size, inference latency, and #FLOPs, aside from inference accuracy. This results in deep learning model designers leveraging multi -objective optimization to design effective deep neural networks in multiple criteria. However, applying multi -objective optimizations to neural architecture search (NAS) is nontrivial because NAS tasks usually have a huge search space, along with a non -negligible searching cost. This requires effective multi -objective search algorithms to alleviate the GPU costs. In this work, we implement a novel multi -objectives optimizer based on a recently proposed meta -algorithm called LaMOO Zhao et al. (2022) on NAS tasks. In a nutshell, LaMOO speedups the search process by learning a model from observed samples to partition the search space and then focusing on promising regions likely to contain a subset of the Pareto frontier. Using LaMOO , we observe an improvement of more than 200% sample efficiency compared to Bayesian optimization and evolutionary -based multi -objective optimizers on different NAS datasets. For example, when combined with LaMOO , qEHVI achieves a 225% improvement in sample efficiency compared to using qEHVI alone in NasBench201. For real -world tasks, LaMOO achieves 97.36% accuracy with only 1.62M #Params on CIFAR10 in only 600 search samples. On ImageNet, our large model reaches 80.4% top -1 accuracy with only 522M #FLOPs.

AB Power semiconductor devices are fundamental drivers for advances in power electronics, the technology for electric energy conversion. Power devices based on wide-bandgap (WBG) and ultra-wide bandgap (UWBG) semiconductors allow for a smaller chip size, lower loss and higher frequency compared with their silicon (Si) counterparts, thus enabling a higher system efficiency and smaller form factor. Amongst the challenges for the development and deployment of WBG and UWBG devices is the efficient dissipation of heat, an unavoidable by-product of the higher power density. To mitigate the performance limitations and reliability issues caused by self-heating, thermal management is required at both device and package levels. Packaging in particular is a crucial milestone for the development of any power device technology; WBG and UWBG devices have both reached this milestone recently. This paper provides a timely review of the thermal management of WBG and UWBG power devices with an emphasis on packaged devices. Additionally, emerging UWBG devices hold good promise for high-temperature applications due to their low intrinsic carrier density and increased dopant ionization at elevated temperatures. The fulfillment of this promise in system applications, in conjunction with overcoming the thermal limitations of some UWBG materials, requires new thermal management and packaging technologies. To this end, we provide perspectives on the relevant challenges, potential solutions and research opportunities, highlighting the pressing needs for device-package electrothermal co-design and high-temperature packages that can withstand the high electric fields expected in UWBG devices.

AB Conventional ligands for CsPbBr3 perovskite nanocrystals (NCs), composed of polar, coordinating head groups (e.g., ammonium or zwitterionic) and aliphatic tails, are instrumental in stabilizing the NCs against sintering and aggregation. Nonetheless, the aliphatic (insulating) nature of these ligands represents drawbacks with respect to objectives in optoelectronics, and yet removing these ligands typically leads to a loss of colloidal stability. In this paper, we describe the preparation of CsPbBr3 NCs in the presence of discrete conjugated oligomers that were prepared by an iterative synthetic approach and capped at their chain ends with sulfobetaine zwitterions for perovskite coordination. Notably, these zwitterionic oligofluorenes are compatible with the hot injection and ligand exchange conditions used to prepare CsPbBr3 NCs, yielding stable NC dispersions with high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY, >90%) and spectral features representative of both the perovskite core and conjugated ligand shell. Controlling the chain length of these capping ligands effectively regulated inter-NC spacing and packing geometry when cast into solid films, with evidence derived from both transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and grazing incidence X-ray scattering measurements.

AB A novel method of solving for radiative energy transfer at hypersonic speeds, the voxelized photon Monte Carlo (voxPMC) method, is presented. The voxPMC method is implemented in the Discrete Adaptive Radiative Transport (DART) code and results are given for radiative heat transfer of Mach 9.6 flow over a cylinder. Simulation parameters for this method were tuned to determine requirements for accurate solutions, using benchmark results from NASA's Nonequilibrium Radiative Transport and Spectra Program (NEQAIR). It was found that of the tuning parameters, the mesh resolution and number of simulated photon packets had the largest effect on the resulting solution accuracy. It was found that 108 photon packets, or 5 photon packets per smallest mesh cell dimension, produced accurate results. Voxel resolution refinement and optical boundary conditions were also tested and 2 voxels per smallest mesh cell dimension and an optical symmetry boundary condition produced results that aligned with those given by NEQAIR. Future work will determine if recommendations for these parameters hold for a wider range of applications. Loose coupling between flowfield results and radiation analysis resulted in radiative cooling, which smeared the shock gradients and led to a slight increase in convective heating at the stagnation point.

TI Thermal Transport in Poly(<i>p</i>-phenylene): Anomalous Dimensionality
   Dependence and Role of π-π Stacking
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B

   CONDUCTIVITY
AB For heat conduction along polymer chains, a decreasein the axialthermal conductivity often occurs when the polymer structure changesfrom one-dimensional (1D) to three-dimensional (3D). For example,a single extended aliphatic chain (e.g., polyethylene or poly(dimethylsiloxane))usually has a higher axial thermal conductivity than its double-chainor crystal counterparts because coupling between chains induces stronginterchain anharmonic scatterings. Intuitively, for chains with anaromatic backbone, the even stronger & pi;-& pi; stacking,once formed between chains, should enhance thermal transport acrosschains and suppress the thermal conductivity along the chains. However,we show that this trend is the opposite in poly(p-phenylene) (PPP), a typical chain with an aromatic backbone. Usingmolecular dynamics simulations, we found that the axial thermal conductivityof PPP chains shows an anomalous dimensionality dependence where thethermal conductivity of double-chain and 3D crystal structures ishigher than that of a 1D single chain. We analyzed the probabilitydistribution of dihedral angles and found that & pi;-& pi;stacking between phenyl rings restricts the free rotation of phenylrings and forms a long-range order along the chain, thus enhancingthermal transport along the chain direction. Though possessing a strongerbonding strength and stabilizing the multiple-chain structure, & pi;-& pi;stacking does not lead to a higher interchain thermal conductancebetween phenyl rings compared with that between aliphatic chains.Our simulation results on the effects of & pi;-& pi; stackingprovide insights to engineer thermal transport in polymers at themolecular level.

AB We analyse the results of direct numerical simulations of rotating convection in spherical shell geometries with stress-free boundary conditions, which develop strong zonal flows. Both the Ekman number and the Rayleigh number are varied. We find that the asymptotic theory for rapidly rotating convection can be used to predict the Ekman number dependence of each term in the governing equations, along with the convective flow speeds and the dominant length scales. Using a balance between the Reynolds stress and the viscous stress, together with the asymptotic scaling for the convective velocity, we derive an asymptotic prediction for the scaling behaviour of the zonal flow with respect to the Ekman number, which is supported by the numerical simulations. We do not find evidence of distinct asymptotic scalings for the buoyancy and viscous forces and, in agreement with previous results from asymptotic plane layer models, we find that the ratio of the viscous force to the buoyancy force increases with Rayleigh number. Thus, viscosity remains non-negligible and we do not observe a trend towards a diffusion-free scaling behaviour within the rapidly rotating regime.

AB Misinformation is a global challenge, but successful mitigations must come from the communities affected and not be imposed by external entities. Co center dot Insights is a multi-year NSF-funded initiative building capacity to respond to misinformation and harmful narratives in Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) communities, based on a deep involvement with grassroots organizations and a co-construction of tools grounded on community needs. Co center dot Insights' unique cross-sectoral, cross-disciplinary collaboration is a convergence of information retrieval, computational social science, and ethnographic inquiry with a unique platform that enables community organizations, fact-checkers, and academics to work together to respond effectively to harmful content targeting communities. In this SIRIP talk designed for a technical audience, we will share lessons learned from the first 2.5 years of Co center dot Insights, and how we are bridging the academic-praxis divide by integrating state-of-the-art research developments into large-scale deployed systems. Topics covered will include: the challenges and joys of collaborating across disciplinary and sectoral boundaries; community-driven approaches that utilize information retrieval techniques such as claim matching in concert with emerging best practices in misinformation mitigation; open problems we have encountered in the space; and future directions we find promising. Co center dot Insights is led by Meedan, a global non-profit providing award-winning software solutions to mitigate misinformation; and in partnership with AAPI community organizations and several academic institutions.

AB UV-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy is a common, powerful, and affordable technique for the characterization of heterogeneous catalysts. Here, we present an improved design of the commercial ubiquitous Harrick Scientific high temperature reaction cell for use in diffuse reflectance (DR) UV-vis spectroscopy with fiber optics at very close proximity of a catalyst sample and with high time resolution. The cell possesses significant dead volume which was reduced by a homemade compact dome and by volume reduction of cell void space with simple addition of glass beads, thereby, enabling faster transfer of gases. The cell was also improved by adding a second thermocouple to directly monitor the temperature of the catalyst bed via the outlet port without requiring any additional machining. This modified design and the use of an optical fiber DR probe in conjunction with a miniature concave-CCD combination based spectrometer allowed fast acquisition of in situ UV-vis spectra in the order of seconds and at temperatures up to about 500 degrees C. It is also shown that, unlike probes used in tubular reactors, expensive high temperature DR probes are not required in this design. The flow dynamics of the reaction setup were followed by an analysis of residence time distributions (RTD) via pulse experiments of Ar, O-2, H-2, CO, and CO2 as analyzed online by mass spectrometry (MS). These tests enabled a rigorous analysis of the fluid dynamics of the modified cell showing average gas residence times (after correcting for transfer lines and MS contributions) of similar to 13 s at gas flow rates of 45 cm(3)/min (or similar to 4 s at gas flow rates of 120 cm(3)/min) and a fluid behavior that could be approximately described by a CSTR reactor model. The RTD method is of general application and can be easily implemented to other reaction cells to rigorously determine gas mean residence times and distribution, regardless of setup and transfer lines design, provided that a reaction cell bypass line is added to the system. A thermal analysis indicated that significant heat losses due to radiation, conduction, and convection contribute to the observed sample bed vs heater temperature differences. Additionally, an example is presented to show the utility of the modified cell to monitor quickly (every 2 s) and continuously UV-vis spectra over an extended period of time during the in situ dynamic response of gold surface plasmon resonance (Au-SPR) peak shifts on a Au(1 wt%)/ZrO2 catalyst as it is exposed to controlled and cycling oxidizing and reducing environments. The results showed that the Au-SPR peak responded rapidly and shifted reversibly at the studied cyclic oxidizing and reducing conditions. The reported modifications of the reaction cell setup were shown to enable in situ spectroscopic characterization of heterogeneous catalysts. It proved useful for monitoring adsorption and desorption of gas species near gold nanoparticles via Au-SPR and for potentially tracking rapid changes (within seconds) on catalysts with characteristic finger prints in the UV-vis region.

AB In this paper, we interrogate whether data quality issues track demographic group membership (based on sex, race and age) and whether automated data cleaning - of the kind commonly used in production ML systems - impacts the fairness of predictions made by these systems. To the best of our knowledge, the impact of data cleaning on fairness in downstream tasks has not been investigated in the literature. We first analyse the tuples flagged by common error detection strategies in five research datasets. We find that, while specific data quality issues, such as higher rates of missing values, are associated with membership in historically disadvantaged groups, poor data quality does not generally track demographic group membership. As a follow-up, we conduct a large-scale empirical study on the impact of automated data cleaning on fairness, involving more than 26,000 model evaluations. We observe that, while automated data cleaning is unlikely to worsen accuracy, it is more likely to worsen fairness than to improve it, especially when the cleaning techniques are not carefully chosen. Furthermore, we find that the positive or negative impact of a particular cleaning technique often depends on the choice of fairness metric and group definition (single-attribute or intersectional). We make our code and experimental results publicly available. The analysis we conducted in this paper is difficult, primarily because it requires that we think holistically about disparities in data quality, disparities in the effectiveness of data cleaning methods, and impacts of such disparities on ML model performance for different demographic groups. Such holistic analysis can and should be supported by data engineering tools, and requires substantial data engineering research. Towards this goal, we discuss open research questions, envision the development of fairness-aware data cleaning methods, and their integration into complex pipelines for ML-based decision making.

TI On the Learnability of Out-of-distribution Detection

AB Supervised learning aims to train a classifier under the assumption that training and test data are from the same distribution. To ease the above assumption, researchers have studied a more realistic setting: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, where test data may come from classes that are unknown during training (i.e., OOD data). Due to the unavailability and diversity of OOD data, good generalization ability is crucial for effective OOD detection algorithms, and corresponding learning theory is still an open problem. To study the generalization of OOD detection, this paper investigates the probably approximately correct (PAC) learning theory of OOD detection that fits the commonly used evaluation metrics in the literature. First, we find a necessary condition for the learnability of OOD detection. Then, using this condition, we prove several impossibility theorems for the learnability of OOD detection under some scenarios. Although the impossibility theorems are frustrating, we find that some conditions of these impossibility theorems may not hold in some practical scenarios. Based on this observation, we next give several necessary and sufficient conditions to characterize the learnability of OOD detection in some practical scenarios. Lastly, we offer theoretical support for representative OOD detection works based on our OOD theory.

AB Understanding how additively manufactured components interact with a given environment is critical for the furthering of the technology. Specimens composed of polylactic acid and a polylactic acid-wood composite were made with the additive manufacturing process of fused filament fabrication. The effect of raster pattern as well as exposure to acetic acid (in the form of apple cider vinegar) on mechanical properties was made via tensile testing and dynamic mechanical analysis. Exposure to the apple cider vinegar occurred at a temperature of 60 degrees C for a duration of 168 h. Differences between sample pools were ascertained by application of the Tukey-Kramer honestly significant difference test to collected data. The relationship between moisture absorption and raster pattern was assessed and found to differ between material types. A comprehensive fracture surface analysis was carried out with scanning electron microscopy which gave insight to the effect of raster pattern and material type on fracture surface morphology. It was also noted that bacterial growth occurred on the PLA-wood composite specimens, but not on the PLA specimens. A key observation made here was the presence of adiabatic shear bands, which is potentially the first time this phenomenon has been observed in the case of fused filament fabrication.

ID DIAGNOSTIC ERRORS
AB During training, models can exploit spurious correlations as shortcuts, resulting in poor generalization performance when shortcuts do not persist. In this work, assuming access to a representation based on domain knowledge (i.e., known concepts) that is invariant to shortcuts, we aim to learn robust and accurate models from biased training data. In contrast to previous work, we do not rely solely on known concepts, but allow the model to also learn unknown concepts. We propose two approaches for mitigating shortcuts that incorporate domain knowledge, while accounting for potentially important yet unknown concepts. The first approach is two-staged. After fitting a model using known concepts, it accounts for the residual using unknown concepts. While flexible, we show that this approach is vulnerable when shortcuts are correlated with the unknown concepts. This limitation is addressed by our second approach that extends a recently proposed regularization penalty. Applied to two real-world datasets, we demonstrate that both approaches can successfully mitigate shortcut learning.

AB Rigorous kinetic assessments, pyridine chemical titration and desorption, together with density functional theory calculations establish the trends in the modulation of chemical identity, valence, site density, and strength of Br & oslash;nsted acid sites by counter cations (Na+, K+, Cu2+, Mg2+, and Al3+) on Keggin-type polyoxometalate tungstosilicic acid clusters (H4SiW12O40, POM). Monovalent cations (Na+ and K+) exchange protons and decrease the acid strength of the residual protons, as indicated by the deprotonation energy (DPE) that increases from 1100 to 1175 kJ mol(-1) with an increasing extent of proton exchange (decreasing the nominal H+-to-POM ratio). In contrast, di- and trivalent cations preferentially exchange protons in the form of hydroxides (Yz+(OH)(m), Yz+ = Cu2+, Mg2+, or Al3+, 0 < m < z), resulting in an average DPE value on both POM clusters and associated hydroxides ranging between 1100 and 1150 kJ mol(-1). A portion of these cations disperse on the silica support, generating Lewis acid sites. The exchanged cations modulate the charge within the W12O36 oxide shell, rather than the central SiO44- tetrahedron, which mainly modifies the ionic component of DPE values. Monovalent cations with smaller electronegativities than di- and trivalent cations donate more electrons, which increases the electrostatic interaction of residual protons with conjugate POM- anions and leads to higher DPE values (weaker acids). This study expands the library of Br & oslash;nsted acidic catalysts with flexibility in tuning their acid strengths and densities, thus providing a series of samples for constructing structure-reactivity relationships and probing site electrostatic correlations on structurally constrained domains.

AB We present a set of 1194 Type-1 Rosseland-mean opacity tables for four different metallicity mixtures. These new Los Alamos OPLIB atomic radiative opacity tables are an order of magnitude larger in number than any previous opacity table release, and span regimes where previous opacity tables have not existed. For example, the new set of opacity tables expands the metallicity range to Z = 10-6 to Z = 0.2, which allows improved accuracy of opacities at low and high metallicity, increases the table density in the metallicity range Z = 10-4 to Z = 0.1 to enhance the accuracy of opacities drawn from interpolations across neighboring metallicities, and adds entries for hydrogen mass fractions between X = 0 and X = 0.1 including X = 10-2, 10-3, 10-4, 10-5, 10-6 that can improve stellar models of hydrogen deficient stars. We implement these new OPLIB radiative opacity tables in MESA and find that calibrated solar models agree broadly with previously published helioseismic and solar neutrino results. We find differences between using the new 1194 OPLIB opacity tables and the 126 OPAL opacity tables range from approximate to 20% to 80% across individual chemical mixtures, up to approximate to 8% and approximate to 15% at the bottom and top of the solar convection zone respectively, and approximate to 7% in the solar core. We also find differences between standard solar models using different opacity table sources that are on par with altering the initial abundance mixture. We conclude that this new, open-access set of OPLIB opacity tables does not solve the solar modeling problem, and suggest the investigation of physical mechanisms other than the atomic radiative opacity.

AB There is considerable recent interest in the synthesis and development of peptide-based materials as mimics of natural biological assemblies that utilize proteins and peptides to form organized structures and develop beneficial properties. Due to their potential compatibility with living organisms, synthetic peptide materials are also being developed for applications such as cell grafting, therapeutic delivery, and implantable diagnostic devices. One desirable feature for such applications is the ability to design materials that can respond to stimuli by changes in their structure or properties under biologically relevant conditions. Peptide and protein assemblies can respond to stimuli, such as changes in temperature, solution pH, ions present in media, or interactions with other biomacromolecules. An exciting area of emerging research is focused on how biology uses the chemistry of sulfur-containing amino acids as a means to regulate biological processes. These concepts have been utilized and expanded in recent years to enable the development of peptide materials with readily switchable properties. The incorporation of sulfur atoms in polypeptides, peptides, and proteins provides unique sites that can be used to alter the physical and biological properties of these materials. Sulfur-containing amino acid residues, most often cysteine and methionine, are able to undergo a variety of selective chemical and enzyme-mediated reactions, which can be broadly characterized as redox or alkylation processes. These reactions often proceed under physiologically relevant conditions, can be reversible, and are significant in that they can alter residue polarity as well as conformations of peptide chains. These sulfur-based reactions are able to switch molecular and macromolecular properties of peptides and proteins in living systems and recently have been applied to synthetic peptide materials. Naturally occurring "sulfur switches" can be reversible or irreversible and are often triggered by enzymatic activity. Sulfur switches in peptide materials can also be triggered in vitro using oxidation/reduction and alkylation as well as photochemical reactions. The application of sulfur switches to peptide materials has greatly expanded the scope of these switches due to the ability to readily incorporate a wide variety of noncanonical sulfur-containing synthetic amino acids. Sulfur switches have been shown to provide considerable potential to reversibly alter peptide material properties under mild physiologically relevant conditions. An important molecular feature of sulfur-containing amino acid residues was found to be the location of sulfur atoms in the side chains. The variation of sulfur atom positions from the backbone by single bond lengths was found to significantly affect polypeptide chain conformations upon oxidation-reduction or alkylation/dealkylation reactions. With the successful adaptation of sulfur switches to peptide materials, future studies can explore how these switches affect how these materials interact with biological systems. This Account provides an overview of the different types of sulfur switch reactions found in biology and their properties and the elaboration of these switches in synthetic systems with a focus on recent developments and applications of reversible sulfur switches in peptide materials.

AB We discuss two-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs) which are invariant under gauging a non-invertible global symmetry. At every point on the orbifold branch of c = 1 CFTs, it is known that the theory is self-dual under gauging a DOUBLE-STRUCK CAPITAL Z2 x DOUBLE-STRUCK CAPITAL Z2 symmetry, and has Rep(H8) and Rep(D8) fusion category symmetries as a result. We find that gauging the entire Rep(H8) fusion category symmetry maps the orbifold theory at radius R to that at radius 2/R. At R = 2\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$ \sqrt{2} $$\end{document}, which corresponds to two decoupled Ising CFTs (Ising2 in short), the theory is self-dual under gauging the Rep(H8) symmetry. This implies the existence of a topological defect line in the Ising2 CFT obtained from half-space gauging of the Rep(H8) symmetry, which commutes with the c = 1 Virasoro algebra but does not preserve the fully extended chiral algebra. We bootstrap its action on the c = 1 Virasoro primary operators, and find that there are no relevant or marginal operators preserving it. Mathematically, the new topological line combines with the Rep(H8) symmetry to form a bigger fusion category which is a DOUBLE-STRUCK CAPITAL Z2-extension of Rep(H8). We solve the pentagon equations including the additional topological line and find 8 solutions, where two of them are realized in the Ising2 CFT. Finally, we show that the torus partition functions of the Monster2 CFT and IsingxMonster CFT are also invariant under gauging the Rep(H8) symmetry.

AB Just as a phylogeny encodes the evolutionary relationships among a group of organisms, a cophylogeny represents the coevolutionary relationships among symbiotic partners. Both are primarily reconstructed using computational analysis of biomolecular sequence data. The most widely used cophylogenetic reconstruction methods utilize an important simplifying assumption: species phylogenies for each set of coevolved taxa are required as input and assumed to be correct. Many studies have shown that this assumption is rarely - if ever - satisfied, and the consequences for cophylogenetic studies are poorly understood.
   To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive performance study that quantifies the relationship between species tree estimation error and downstream cophylogenetic estimation accuracy. We study the performance of state-of-the-art methods for cophylogenetic reconstruction using in silico model-based simulations. Our investigation also includes assessments of cophylogenetic reproducibility using genomic sequence datasets sampled from two important models of symbiosis: soil-associated fungi and their endosymbiotic bacteria, and bobtail squid and their bioluminescent bacterial symbionts.
   Our findings conclusively demonstrate the major impact that upstream phylogenetic estimation error has on downstream cophylogenetic reconstruction quality. Relative to other experimental factors such as cophylogenetic estimation method choice and coevolutionary event costs, phylogenetic estimation error ranked highest in importance based on a random forest-based variable importance assessment. We conclude with practical guidance and future research directions. In particular, among the many considerations needed for accurate cophylogenetic reconstruction - choice of cophylogenetic reconstruction method and method settings, sampling design, and others - just as much attention must be paid to careful species phylogeny estimation using modern best practices.

ID TRANSITION
AB The difficulty of achieving ohmic contacts is a long-standing challenge for the development and integration of devices based on 2D materials, due to the large mismatch between their electronic properties and those of both traditional metal-based and van der Waals (vdWs) electrodes. Research has focused primarily on the electronic energy band alignment, while the effects of momentum mismatch on carrier transport across the vdWs gaps are largely neglected. Graphene-silicon junctions are utilized to demonstrate that electron momentum distribution can dominate the electronic properties of vdWs contacts. By judiciously introducing scattering centers at the interface that provide additional momentum to compensate the momentum mismatch, the junction conductivity is enhanced by more than three orders of magnitude, enabling the formation of high-quality ohmic contacts. The study establishes the framework for the design of high-performance ohmic vdWs contacts based on both energy and momentum matching, which can facilitate efficient heterogeneous integration of 2D-3D systems and the development of post-CMOS architectures.

AB This paper proposes a framework to examine how neighborhood factors influence criminal justice (CJ) contact and contribute to disparities across multiple stages of the justice process. By conceptualizing the punishment process as a dynamic set of decision-making points, this study highlights the role of neighborhood context in shaping offenders' CJ trajectories and post-CJ residential inequality. Using Harris County, Texas, as a case study, this research considers individual-, neighborhood-, and event-level variables to understand the cumulative effects of neighborhood characteristics on CJ outcomes. This study underscores the critical need to investigate neighborhood mobility and its broader implications for community development and public policy. The findings can be supported by extensive data from the Federal Statistical Research Data Centers and the Criminal Justice Administrative Records System, offering a robust analysis of offenders' spatial patterns and economic transitions.

AB In this work, the impact of protonation on the photoisomerization (trans -> cis) and reversion (cis -> trans) of three pyridine-based azo dyes (PyrN) is investigated by using a combination of transient absorption spectroscopy and time-dependent density functional theory computed difference spectra. The photophysical behaviors of the PyrN dyes are altered by the addition of one or two protons. Protonation of basic pyridine nitrogens results in an ultrafast accelerated reversion mechanism after photoisomerization, while protonation of azo bond nitrogens restricts cis isomer formation entirely. Computed difference spectra provide spectral signatures that are critical for the assignment of low-population long-lived states, providing direct evidence of the accelerated reversion mechanism. Thus, the addition of organic acids can selectively control the photophysics of azo dyes for a wide range of applications, including materials design and pharmaceuticals.

AB Mismatch repair (MMR) is a highly conserved DNA repair pathway that recognizes mispairs that occur spontaneously during DNA replication and coordinates their repair. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Msh2-Msh3 and Msh2-Msh6 initiate MMR by recognizing and binding insertion or deletion (in/del) loops up to similar to 17 nucleotides (nt.) and base-base mispairs, respectively; the 2 complexes have overlapping specificity for small (1-2 nt.) in/dels. The DNA-binding specificity for the 2 complexes resides in their respective mispair binding domains (MBDs) and has distinct DNA-binding modes. Msh2-Msh3 also plays a role in promoting CAG/CTG trinucleotide repeat (TNR) expansions, which underlie many neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's disease and myotonic dystrophy type 1. Models for Msh2-Msh3's role in promoting TNR tract expansion have invoked its specific DNA-binding activity and predict that the TNR structure alters its DNA binding and downstream activities to block repair. Using a chimeric Msh complex that replaces the MBD of Msh6 with the Msh3 MBD, we demonstrate that Msh2-Msh3 DNA-binding activity is not sufficient to promote TNR expansions. We propose a model for Msh2-Msh3-mediated TNR expansions that requires a fully functional Msh2-Msh3 including DNA binding, coordinated ATP binding, and hydrolysis activities and interactions with Mlh complexes that are analogous to those required for MMR.

TI Coexistence of quantum spin Hall and magnetic states in zigzag bismuth
   nanoribbons
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
AB Chemical modifications and/or simple vertical stacking of disparate van der Waals layered crystals can be used as a materials design approach for creating novel phases of matter. Here, using ab initio computations, we demonstrate the realization of an unusual state in a bismuth nanoribbon decorated with nitrogen atoms along one of the edges. In this phase, the quantum spin Hall state on one edge of the nanoribbon coexists with the ferromagnetism on the other edge. Such a coexistence is made possible by the short-range nature of the exchange interactions on the magnetic edge. As a result, the quantum spin Hall state on the opposite edge of the nanoribbon does not feel the local breaking of time-reversal symmetry on the magnetic edge. While the edge with quantum spin Hall state exhibits the typical spinhelical texture associated with the state, the magnetic edge displays +/- k-asymmetry due to the interplay of Rashba and exchange effects. The latter is also a half-metal and can generate a fully spin-polarized current. We demonstrate that this coexistence of states is robust and that it is exhibited even when the nitrogen-decorated nanoribbon is placed on a substrate. In addition, with a proof-of-principle heterostructure, composed of an undecorated bismuth nanoribbon on hexagonal boron nitride, we show that this mixture of states can potentially exist even without passivation with nitrogen-atoms. In the heterostructure, an unequal relaxation along the two edges of the nanoribbon is found to be responsible for the coexistence of two states.

AB Thermal radiation emission poses a challenge for using most existing ceramics for thermal environmental barrier coatings of gas -turbine engines operating at temperatures approaching 1500 degrees C and beyond. This study presents a strategy for photon transport mitigation in fully dense ceramic composites by increasing the refractive index mismatch between the matrix and particle oxides. We investigate this strategy by analyzing radiative properties in 118 different rare-earth pyrosilicate-pyrochlore ceramic composites. We use density functional theory to predict the optical properties of homogeneous oxides and Lorentz-Mie theory to model scattering at the interfaces of the composite. Our findings demonstrate that increasing the refractive mismatch between the matrix and oxide phases can significantly reduce radiative heat flux. Furthermore, we show that additional thermal radiation suppression can be achieved by increasing the particle size. Our theoretical investigation has the potential to aid in the discovery of new coating ceramic composites and guide their microstructural design.

AB Thermal decomposition of tetraethylsilane was investigated at temperatures up to 1330 K using flash pyrolysis vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometry. Density functional theory and transition state theory calculations were performed to corroborate the experimental observations. Both experimental and theoretical evidence showed that the pyrolysis of tetraethylsilane was initiated by Si-C bond fission to the primary reaction products, triethylsilyl (SiEt3) and ethyl radicals. In the secondary reactions of the triethylsilyl radical, at lower temper-atures, the beta-hydride elimination pathway (producing HSiEt2) was found to be more favored than its competing reaction channel, Si-C bond fission (producing :SiEt2); as the temperature further increased, the Si-C bond fission reaction became significant. Other important secondary reaction products, such as EtHSi=CH2 (m/z = 72), H2SiEt (m/z = 59), and SiH3 (m/z = 31) were identified, and their formation mechanisms were also proposed.

AB Here we report an in situ UV-vis spectroscopy study of O2 and H2 adsorption on small gold nanoparticles supported on SiO2, Al2O3, ZrO2, ZnO, and TiO2 P-25 at high temperature which provides insights into gold adsorption and active sites. In situ gold surface plasmon resonance peak shifts from alternating and consecutive adsorption of O2 to H2 were correlated to relative charge transfer from/to gold via a Drude-Lorentz model considering contributions from free electrons and interband transitions. A novel methodology matching the relative charge transfer (from O2 and H2 adsorption at 398 K and flowing conditions) with Au surface site statistics derived from a truncated octahedron geometric model was used to provide strong in situ experimental and spectroscopic evidence for adsorption of O2 and H2 at the gold-support perimeter, which agrees with prior hypotheses for active site location from reactivity and theoretical studies. The prepared catalysts were also evaluated for CO oxidation at 398 K. The resulting TOFs normalized per different surface site location indicated that conversion rates were not limited by the density of sites at the gold-support perimeter, but primarily by the total gold surface sites, which were also further differentiated by the reducibility of the catalyst support.

AB Synthesis of (Z)-alkenes is challenging because the (E) stereoisomers are usually more stable. Energy transfer photocatalysis has emerged as an efficient strategy for (E) -> (Z) alkene isomerization. We report the development of an advanced undergraduate laboratory experiment that introduces students to contemporary organic photocatalysis methods and theory within the context of the energy transfer photocatalyzed (E) -> (Z) isomerization of 2-nitrocinnamaldehyde. Students assess the ability of the photocatalysts [Ru(bpy)3][PF6]2 and [TPP][BF4] to promote substrate isomerization, monitor and analyze reactions by 1H NMR spectroscopy, and probe the isomerization mechanism via computational chemistry. This work uses the Wisconsin Photoreactor Platform, a source of affordable, readily fabricated, and reliable photoreactors.

AB Transition metal mechanophores exhibiting force-activated spin-crossover are attractive design targets, yet large-scale discovery of them has not been pursued due in large part to the time-consuming nature of trial-and-error experiments. Instead, we leverage density functional theory (DFT) and external force explicitly included (EFEI) modeling to study a set of 395 feasible Fe2+ and Co2+ mechanophore candidates with tridentate ligands that we curate from the Cambridge Structural Database. Among nitrogen-coordinating low-spin complexes, we observe the prevalence of spin crossover at moderate force, and we identify 155 Fe2+ and Co2+ spin-crossover mechanophores and derive their threshold force for low-spin to high-spin transition (F SCO). The calculations reveal strong correlations of F SCO with spin-splitting energies and coordination bond lengths, facilitating rapid prediction of F SCO using force-free DFT calculations. Then, among all Fe2+ and Co2+ spin-crossover mechanophores, we further identity 11 mechanophores that combine labile spin-crossover and good mechanical robustness that are thus predicted to be the most versatile for force-probing applications. We discover two classes of mer-symmetric complexes comprising specific heteroaromatic rings within extended pi-conjugation that give rise to Fe2+ mechanophores with these characteristics. We expect the set of spin-crossover mechanophores, the design principles, and the computational approach to be useful in guiding the high-throughput discovery of transition metal mechanophores with diverse functionalities and broad applications, including mechanically activated catalysis.

AB Edge termination is the enabling building block of power devices to exploit the high breakdown field of wide bandgap (WBG) and ultra-wide bandgap (UWBG) semiconductors. This work presents a heterogeneous junction termination extension (JTE) based on p-type nickel oxide (NiO) for gallium oxide (Ga2O3) devices. Distinct from prior JTEs usually made by implantation or etch, this NiO JTE is deposited on the surface of Ga2O3 by magnetron sputtering. The JTE consists of multiple NiO layers with various lengths to allow for a graded decrease in effective charge density away from the device active region. Moreover, this surface JTE has broad design window and process latitude, and its efficiency is drift-layer agnostic. The physics of this NiO JTE is validated by experimental applications into NiO/Ga2O3 p-n diodes fabricated on two Ga2O3 wafers with different doping concentrations. The JTE enables a breakdown voltage over 3.2 kV and a consistent parallel-plate junction field of 4.2 MV/cm in both devices, rendering a power figure of merit of 2.5-2.7 GW/cm(2). These results show the great promise of the deposited JTE as a flexible, near ideal edge termination for WBG and UWBG devices, particularly those lacking high-quality homojunctions.

AB Dynamically adjusting the content of augmented reality (AR) applications to efficiently display information best fitting the available screen estate may be important for user performance and satisfaction. Currently, there is not a common practice for dynamically adjusting the content of AR applications based on their apparent size in the user's view of the surround environment. We present a Level-of-Detail AR mechanism to improve the usability of AR applications at any relative size. Our mechanism dynamically renders textual and interactable content based on its legibility, interactability, and viewability respectively. When tested, Level-of-Detail AR functioned as intended out-of-the-box on 44 of the 45 standard user interface Unity prefabs in Microsoft's Mixed Reality Tool Kit. We additionally evaluated impact on task performance, user distance, and subjective satisfaction through a mixed-design user study with 45 participants. Statistical analysis of our results revealed significant task-dependent differences in user performance between the modes. User satisfaction was consistently higher for the Level-of-Detail AR condition.

AB Cementation in construction materials primarily relies on the aqueous precipitation of minerals such as carbonates and silicates. The kinetics of nucleation and growth play a critical role in the development of strength and durability, yet our understanding of the kinetic controls governing phase formation and porosity reduction in cements remains limited. In this study, we synthesized bisphosphonate molecules with varying alkyl chain lengths and functional groups to investigate their impact on calcium carbonate precipitation. Through conductivity measurements, infrared spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis, we uncovered the selective formation of polymorphs and the specific incorporation of these molecules within the carbonate matrix. Further, in situ atomic force microscopy revealed that these molecules influenced the morphology of the precipitates, indicating a possible effect on the ionic organization through sorption mechanisms. Interestingly, amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC), when formed in the presence of bisphosphonates, showed metastability for at least seven months without inhibiting further calcium carbonate precipitation. Our research sheds light on the diverse mechanisms by which organic additives can modify mineral nucleation and growth, offering valuable insights for the control and enhancement of carbonate-based cementation processes.

AB Metamaterials with functional responses can exhibit varying properties under different conditions (e.g., wave-based responses or deformation-induced property variation). This work addresses rapid inverse design of such metamaterials to meet target qualitative functional behaviors, a challenge due to its intractability and nonunique solutions. Unlike data-intensive and noninterpretable deep-learning-based methods, this work proposes the random-forest-based interpretable generative inverse design (RIGID), a single-shot inverse design method for fast generation of metamaterials with on-demand functional behaviors. RIGID leverages the interpretability of a random forest-based "design -> response" forward model, eliminating the need for a more complex "response -> design" inverse model. Based on the likelihood of target satisfaction derived from the trained random forest, one can sample a desired number of design solutions using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. RIGID is validated on acoustic and optical metamaterial design problems, each with fewer than 250 training samples. Compared to the genetic algorithm-based design generation approach, RIGID generates satisfactory solutions that cover a broader range of the design space, allowing for better consideration of additional figures of merit beyond target satisfaction. This work offers a new perspective on solving on-demand inverse design problems, showcasing the potential for incorporating interpretable machine learning into generative design under small data constraints.

AB We study the problem of constructing explicit sparse graphs that exhibit strong vertex expansion. Our main result is the first two-sided construction of imbalanced unique-neighbor expanders, meaning bipartite graphs where small sets contained in both the left and right bipartitions exhibit unique-neighbor expansion, along with algebraic properties relevant to constructing quantum codes.
   Our constructions are obtained from instantiations of the tripartite line product of a large tripartite spectral expander and a sufficiently good constant-sized unique-neighbor expander, a new graph product we defined that generalizes the line product and the routed product of previous well-known works. To analyze the vertex expansion of graphs arising from the tripartite line product, we develop a sharp characterization of subgraphs that can arise in bipartite spectral expanders, generalizing previously known results, which may be of independent interest.
   By picking appropriate graphs to apply our product to, we give a strongly explicit construction of an infinite family of (d(1),d(2))-biregular graphs (G(n))(n >= 1) (for large enough d(1) and d(2)) where all sets S with fewer than a small constant fraction of vertices have Omega(d1 center dot vertical bar S vertical bar) unique-neighbors (assuming d(1) <= d(2)). Additionally, we can also guarantee that subsets of vertices of size up to exp(Omega(root log vertical bar V(G(n))|vertical bar) expand losslessly.

AB Alkene ozonolysis generates transient carbonyl oxide species, known as Criegee intermediates, which are a significant nonphotolytic source of OH radicals in the troposphere. This study demonstrates that unimolecular decay of syn-methyl-substituted Criegee intermediates proceeds via 1,4 H atom transfer to vinyl hydroperoxides, resulting in OH fission to O-O products or, alternatively, OH roaming to hydroxycarbonyl products. Newly generated Criegee intermediates are shown to yield hydroxycarbonyls with sufficient internal excitation to dissociate via C-C fission to acyl and hydroxymethyl (CH2OH) radicals. The stabilized Criegee intermediates and unimolecular products are rapidly cooled in a pulsed supersonic expansion for photoionization detection with time-of-flight mass spectrometry. CH2OH products are identified by 2 + 1 resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization via the 3p(z) Rydberg state upon unimolecular decay of CH3CHOO, (CH3)(2)COO, (CH3)(CH3CH2)COO, and (CH3)(CH2=CH)COO (methyl vinyl ketone oxide). The stabilized Criegee intermediates are separately detected using 10.5 eV photoionization. This study provides the first experimental evidence of roaming in the unimolecular decay of isoprene-derived methyl vinyl ketone oxide and extends earlier studies that reported stabilized hydroxycarbonyl products.

AB Objective: We designed and validated a wireless, low-cost, easy-to-use, mobile, dry-electrode headset for scalp electroencephalography (EEG) recordings for closed-loop brain-computer (BCI) interface and internet-of-things (IoT) applications. Approach: The EEG-based BCI headset was designed from commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components using a multi-pronged approach that balanced interoperability, cost, portability, usability, form factor, reliability, and closed-loop operation. Main Results: The adjustable headset was designed to accommodate 90% of the population. A patent-pending self-positioning dry electrode bracket allowed for vertical self-positioning while parting the user's hair to ensure contact of the electrode with the scalp. In the current prototype, five EEG electrodes were incorporated in the electrode bracket spanning the sensorimotor cortices bilaterally, and three skin sensors were included to measure eye movement and blinks. An inertial measurement unit (IMU) provides monitoring of head movements. The EEG amplifier operates with 24-bit resolution up to 500 Hz sampling frequency and can communicate with other devices using 802.11 b/g/n WiFi. It has high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) (121 dB and 110 dB, respectively) and low input noise. In closed-loop BCI mode, the system can operate at 40 Hz, including real-time adaptive noise cancellation and 512 MB of processor memory. It supports LabVIEW as a backend coding language and JavaScript (JS), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and HyperText Markup Language (HTML) as front-end coding languages and includes training and optimization of support vector machine (SVM) neural classifiers. Extensive bench testing supports the technical specifications and human-subject pilot testing of a closed-loop BCI application to support upper-limb rehabilitation and provides proof-of-concept validation for the device's use at both the clinic and at home. Significance: The usability, interoperability, portability, reliability, and programmability of the proposed wireless closed-loop BCI system provides a low-cost solution for BCI and neurorehabilitation research and IoT applications.

AB Seasonal snow cover is important in shaping ecosystem carbon uptake across many regions of the world, however forest responses to projected declines in snowpack remain uncertain. We studied the response of forest gross primary productivity (GPP) during the photosynthetically active season to interannual and spatial variability in snow water equivalent (SWE), timing of snowmelt, and length of the active season. We combined carbon flux and weather data from 14 temperate deciduous and evergreen forests in the US and southeast Canada with SWE and precipitation from the Snow Data Assimilation System to test these hypotheses: 1) earlier snowmelt leads to a longer active season; 2) a longer active season is associated with higher total GPP, and 3) GPP during the active season is dependent on peak SWE and timing of snowmelt the previous winter. Regression and correlation analyses did not reveal meaningful environmental predictors of interannual variability in GPP, so linear mixed effects models were used to analyze broader scale spatiotemporal patterns. We found that active season length was negatively correlated with total active season GPP in forests with drier summers on average (based on mean annual summer climatic water deficit), but positively correlated in areas with typically wetter summers. The magnitude of these effects decreased at forests with a higher percentage of annual precipitation falling as snow. Our results showed that the capacity for plants to gain more carbon during a longer active season appears to be dependent on soil water status determined by long-term climate, rather than interannual fluctuations in weather. We found no evidence that the magnitude of total snowfall or peak SWE had a legacy effect on subsequent active season GPP. Finally, we highlight that there was large interannual variability both within and between sites that was not well explained by seasonal climate or phenology.

AB Although gender parity has been achieved in some STEM fields, gender disparities persist in computing, one of the fastest-growing and highest-earning career fields. In this systematic literature review, we expand upon academic momentum theory to categorize computing interventions intended to make computing environments more inclusive to girls and women and consider how those characteristics vary by the success of the intervention. Particular attention is given to the efficacy of broadening participation and success for women in computer science, information technology, and related fields. After scrutinizing 168 relevant studies, 48 met the inclusion criteria and were included. We introduce a framework for gender equity in computing, expanding on existing research on academic and STEM momentum to encompass new domains representing social and structural momentum. Our analysis reveals the complex roles of intervention domains, strategies, goals, levels, and duration in shaping their efficacy. Implications for theory, research, and practice are discussed.

AB Machine learning techniques have become ubiquitous both in industry and academic applications. Increasing model sizes and training data volumes necessitate fast and efficient distributed training approaches. Collective communications greatly simplify inter- and intra-node data transfer and are an essential part of the distributed training process as information such as gradients must be shared between processing nodes. In this paper, we survey the current state-of-the-art collective communication libraries (namely xCCL, including NCCL, oneCCL, RCCL, MSCCL, ACCL, and Gloo), with a focus on the industry-led ones for deep learning workloads. We investigate the design features of these xCCLs, discuss their use cases in the industry deep learning workloads, compare their performance with industry-made benchmarks (i.e., NCCL Tests and PARAM), and discuss key take-aways and interesting observations. We believe our survey sheds light on potential research directions of future designs for xCCLs.

AB The formation of thin oxide films is of significant scientific and practical interest. In particular, the semiconductor industry is interested in developing a plasma atomic layer etching process to pattern copper, replacing the dual Damascene process. Using a nonthermal oxygen plasma to convert the metallic copper into copper oxide, followed by a formic acid organometallic reaction to etch the copper oxide, this process has shown great promise. However, the current process is not optimal because the plasma oxidation step is not self-limiting, hampering the degree of thickness control. In the present study, a neural network potential for the binary interaction between copper and oxygen is developed and validated against first-principles calculations. This potential covers the entire range of potential energy surfaces of metallic copper, copper oxides, atomic oxygen, and molecular oxygen. The usable kinetic energy ranges from 0 to 20 eV. Using this potential, the plasma oxidation of copper surfaces was studied with large-scale molecular dynamics at atomic resolution, with an accuracy approaching that of the first principle calculations. An amorphous layer of CuO is formed on Cu, with thicknesses reaching 2.5 nm. Plasma is found to create an intense local heating effect that rapidly dissipates across the thickness of the film. The range of this heating effect depends on the kinetic energy of the ions. A higher ion energy leads to a longer range, which sustains faster-than-thermal rates for longer periods of time for the oxide growth. Beyond the range of this agitation, the growth is expected to be limited to the thermally activated rate. High-frequency, repeated ion impacts result in a microannealing effect that leads to a quasicrystalline oxide beneath the amorphized layer. The crystalline layer slows down oxide growth. Growth rate is fitted to the temperature gradient due to ion-induced thermal agitations, to obtain an apparent activation energy of 1.0 eV. A strategy of lowering the substrate temperature and increasing plasma power is proposed as being favorable for more self-limited oxidation.

AB Resource disaggregation is prevalent in datacenters since it provides high resource utilization when compared to servers dedicated to either compute, memory, or storage. NVMe-over-Fabrics (NVMe-oF) is the standardized protocol for accessing disaggregated network storage. Currently, the NVMe-oF specification lacks semantics to prioritize I/O requests based on different application needs. Since applications have varying goals - latency-sensitive or throughput-critical I/O- we need to design efficient schemes to allow applications to specify the type of performance they wish to achieve. To this end, we propose a new NVMe-over-Priority-Fabrics (NVMe-oPF) protocol with multi-tenancy support that allows applications to specify whether to optimize for latency or throughput. NVMe-oPF proposes coalescing request completions, lock-free optimization, zero-copy queues, out-of-order request completion handling, and window size optimization for the specific I/O patterns, queue depths, and I/O sizes that yield the best performance. Our NVMe-oPF-10 Gbps can achieve up to 2.94X improvement in throughput and reduces tail latency by up to 32.1% for highly concurrent multi-tenant read workloads when compared to the state-of-the-art userspace NVMe-oF runtime design in Intel Storage Performance Development Kit (SPDK). For write workloads with 100 Gbps, NVMe-oPF achieves a 32.6% increase in throughput while maintaining low latency compared to SPDK. We also bring performance benefits to the application level with HDF5 by increasing write workload throughput by 25.2% in larger-scale experiments.

AB Faces can be categorized along various dimensions including gender or race, an ability developing in infancy. Infant categorization studies have focused on facial attributes in isolation, but the interaction between these attributes remains poorly understood. Experiment 1 examined gender categorization of other-race faces in 9- and 12-month-old White infants. Nine- and 12-month-olds were familiarized with Asian male or female faces, and tested with a novel exemplar from the familiarized category paired with a novel exemplar from a novel category. Both age groups showed novel category preferences for novel Asian female faces after familiarization with Asian male faces, but showed no novel category preference for novel Asian male faces after familiarization with Asian female faces. This categorization asymmetry was not due to a spontaneous preference hindering novel category reaction (Experiment 2), and both age groups displayed difficulty discriminating among male, but not female, other-race faces (Experiment 3). These results indicate that category formation for male other-race faces is mediated by categorical perception. Overall, the findings suggest that even by 12 months of age, infants are not fully able to form gender category representations of other-race faces, responding categorically to male, but not female, other-race faces.

AB An extended microkinetic model (MKM) for the selective oxidation of ethylene to ethylene oxide (EO) is presented, based on an oxidic representation of the silver (Ag) surface, namely, the p(4 x 4) oxidic reconstruction of the Ag(111) phase to mimic the significant oxygen coverage under reaction conditions, as is evidenced by recent operando spectroscopic studies. The MKM features three pathways each for producing either ethylene oxide (EO) or carbon dioxide (CO2), including the common intermediate or oxometallacycle (OMC) pathway, an atomic oxygen pathway, as well as pathways centered around the role of a diatomic oxygen species occupying an oxygen vacancy (O2/O*). The MKM uses a composite set of experimental and density functional theory (DFT) kinetic parameters, which is further optimized and trained on experimental reaction data. A multistart ensemble approach was used to ensure a thorough sampling of the solution space, and a closer analysis was performed on the best-performing, physically meaningful solution. In agreement with published DFT data, the optimized MKM observed that the OMC pathway heavily favors the total combustion pathway and alone is insufficient in explaining the similar to 50% EO selectivity commonly reported. Furthermore, it confirmed the pivotal role of the O2/O* species in the flux-carrying pathways for EO production. The MKM additionally highlights the fluctuating nature of the catalyst surface, in that the proportion of metallic to oxidic phase changes according to the reaction conditions, accordingly resulting in kinetic implications.

AB Mutualisms constitute a diverse class of ecologically important interactions, yet their ecological and evolutionary stability remain topics of debate in coevolutionary theory. Recent theoretical and empirical work has suggested that coevolutionary arms races may be involved in the maintenance of mutualistic interactions, sustaining mutually beneficial outcomes for interacting species while producing exaggerated traits. Here we present an individual-based model that evaluates how asynchronous life histories-that is, partners with different average lifespans-change the dynamics of trait coevolution, the expected fitness outcomes for species involved, and the dynamics of selection differentials across time for each species. Results indicate that a longer-lived mutualist will consistently "lose" an otherwise balanced coevolutionary arms race, being outpaced in both the mean trait value and fitness outcome compared with a shorter-lived partner. Furthermore, linear selection differentials on mutualistic traits become increasingly divergent as life histories become increasingly asynchronous, with the longer-lived species experiencing persistent directional selection and the shorter-lived species experiencing weaker, more inconsistent selection. These results suggest that asynchronous life histories can complicate the maintenance of mutualistic interactions via coevolutionary arms races and that detecting coevolution via selection differentials may be difficult when life histories are sufficiently divergent.

AB Wildfire evacuations have become a persistent challenge all over the world in recent years. Studies have proposed various evacuation strategies, such as vehicle reduction, phased evacuation, and prohibition of on-street parking, which have demonstrated effectiveness in specific communities. However, a comprehensive study that generalizes the effectiveness and applicability of these strategies across different types of communities is lacking. This generalization could hold significant value for small, resource-strapped communities situated in wildland-urban interface zones (i.e., comprising a mix of residences and flammable vegetation) that lack the resources to conduct dedicated evacuation studies. In this study, two indicators, the ratio of background traffic volume to the number of evacuees (RBE), and the ratio of the capacity of the main evacuation roads to the number of evacuees (RCE) were derived to categorize communities into specific groups based on their characteristics during wildfire events. Through evacuation simulations of some typical real-world communities, the applicability and effectiveness of each strategy for each group was assessed. For the given scenarios considered, the findings revealed that for communities with high a RBE and low RCE, promoting carpooling with more than two people per vehicle, extending phased evacuation intervals with safety assurance for evacuees, and enforcing on-street parking prohibition made evacuations more effective. For other communities, encouraging families to use fewer vehicles and implementing a 15-min phased interval, if possible, could potentially be useful.

AB We tackle the communication efficiency challenge of learning kernelized contextual bandits in a distributed setting. Despite the recent advances in communication-efficient distributed bandit learning, existing solutions are restricted to simple models like multi-armed bandits and linear bandits, which hamper their practical utility. In this paper, instead of assuming the existence of a linear reward mapping from the features to the expected rewards, we consider non-linear reward mappings, by letting agents collaboratively search in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). This introduces significant challenges in communication efficiency as distributed kernel learning requires the transfer of raw data, leading to a communication cost that grows linearly w.r.t. time horizon T. We address this issue by equipping all agents to communicate via a common Nystrom embedding that gets updated adaptively as more data points are collected. We rigorously proved that our algorithm can attain sub-linear rate in both regret and communication cost.

AB In this study, the phase behavior of the mixed transition metal diborides is explored and the thermodynamic stability of the equiatomic mixed diborides, also known as the high entropy diborides (HEBs) is investigated by employing the density functional theory (DFT), the quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA), and the calculationof-the-phase-diagram (CALPHAD) approach. The findings reveal insights into the roles of mixing enthalpy, vibrational entropy and configurational entropy in determining the phase stability of the mixed diborides, paving the ways for the materials design of the mixed diborides beyond the equiatomic compounds. In addition, the detailed discussion of the limitations in the Debye-Gr & uuml;neisen model for transition metal diborides provides the understanding of the phonon contribution to the thermodynamic stability.

AB Over the past 15 years, the D-statistic, a four-taxon test for organismal admixture (hybridization, or introgression) which incorporates single nucleotide polymorphism data with allelic patterns ABBA and BABA, has seen considerable use. This statistic seeks to discern significant deviation from either a given species tree assumption, or from the balanced incomplete lineage sorting that could otherwise defy this species tree. However, while the D-statistic can successfully discriminate admixture from incomplete lineage sorting, it is not a simple matter to determine the directionality of admixture using only four-leaf tree models. As such, methods have been developed that use five leaves to evaluate admixture. Among these, the D-FOIL method ("FOIL", a mnemonic for "First-Outer-Inner-Last"), which tests allelic patterns on the "symmetric" tree S=(((1,2),(3,4)),5), succeeds in finding admixture direction for many five-taxon examples. However, D-FOIL does not make full use of all symmetry, nor can D-FOIL function properly when ancient samples are included because of the reliance on singleton patterns (such as BAAAA and ABAAA). Here, we take inspiration from DFOIL to develop a new and completely general family of five-leaf admixture tests, dubbed Delta-statistics, that can either incorporate or exclude the singleton allelic patterns depending on individual taxon and age sampling choices. We describe two new shapes that are also fully testable, namely the "asymmetric" tree A=((((1,2),3),4),5) and the "quasisymmetric" tree Q=(((1,2),3),(4,5)), which can considerably supplement the "symmetric" S=(((1,2),(3,4)),5) model used by DFOIL. We demonstrate the consistency of Delta-statistics under various simulated scenarios, and provide empirical examples using data from black, brown and polar bears, the latter also including two ancient polar bear samples from previous studies. Recently, D-FOIL and one of these ancient samples was used to argue for a dominant polar bear -> brown bear introgression direction. However, we find, using both this ancient polar bear and our own, that by far the strongest signal using both DFOIL and Delta-statistics on tree S is actually bidirectional gene flow of indistinguishable direction. Further experiments on trees A and Q instead highlight what were likely two phases of admixture: one with stronger brown bear -> polar bear introgression in ancient times, and a more recent phase with predominant polar bear -> brown bear directionality.

TI Best-in-class modeling: A novel strategy to discover constitutive models

AB The ability to automatically discover interpretable mathematical models from data could forever change how we model soft matter systems. For convex discovery problems with a unique global minimum, model discovery is well-established. It uses a classical top-down approach that first calculates a dense parameter vector, and then sparsifies the vector by gradually removing terms. For non-convex discovery problems with multiple local minima, this strategy is infeasible since the initial parameter vector is generally non-unique. Here we propose a novel bottom -up approach that starts with a sparse single -term vector, and then densifies the vector by systematically adding terms. Along the way, we discover models of gradually increasing complexity, a strategy that we call best-in-class modeling . To identify and select successful candidate terms, we reverseengineer a library of sixteen functional building blocks that integrate a century of knowledge in material modeling with recent trends in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Yet, instead of solving the NP hard discrete combinatorial problem with 2 16 = 65,536 possible combinations of terms, best-in-class modeling starts with the best one-term model and iteratively repeats adding terms, until the objective function meets a user-defined convergence criterion. Strikingly, for most practical purposes, we achieve good convergence with only one or two terms. We illustrate the best-in-class one- and two-term models for a variety of soft matter systems including rubber, brain, artificial meat, skin, and arteries. Our discovered models display distinct and unexpected features for each family of materials, and suggest that best-in-class modeling is an efficient, robust, and easy-to-use strategy to discover the mechanical signatures of traditional and unconventional soft materials. We anticipate that our technology will generalize naturally to other classes of natural and man made soft matter with applications in artificial organs, stretchable electronics, soft robotics, and artificial meat.

TI Cooperative Interactions with Water Drive Hysteresis in a Hydrophilic
   Metal-Organic Framework
SO CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS

AB Devices that utilize the reversible capture of water vapor provide solutions to water insecurity, increasing energy demand, and sustainability. In all of these applications, it is important to minimize water adsorption-desorption hysteresis. Hysteresis is particularly difficult to avoid for sorbents that bind water strongly, such as those that take up below 10% relative humidity (RH). Even though the theoretical factors that affect hysteresis are understood, understanding the structure-function correlations that dictate the hysteretic behavior in water sorbents remains a challenge. Herein, we synthesize a new hexagonal microporous framework, Ni(2)Cl(2)BBTQ (H(2)BBTQ = 2H,6H-benzo[1,2-d][4,5-d ']bistriazolequinone), to elucidate these principles. Uniquely among its known isoreticular analogues, Ni(2)Cl(2)BBTQ presents unusually high hysteresis caused by strong wetting seeded by a particularly strong zero-coverage interaction with water. A combination of vibrational spectroscopies and detailed molecular dynamics simulations reveals that this hysteretic behavior is the result of an intricate hydrogen-bonding network, in which the monolayer consists of water simultaneously binding to open nickel sites and hydrogen bonding to quinone sites. This latter hydrogen-bonding interaction does not exist in other isoreticular analogues: it prevents facile water dynamics and drives hysteresis. Our results highlight an important design criterion for water sorbents: in order to drive water uptake in progressively dry conditions, the common strategy of increasing hydrophilicity can cause strong wetting and the formation of superclusters, which lead to undesirable hysteresis. Instead, hysteresis-free water uptake at extremely low humidity is best promoted by decreasing the pore size, rather than increasing hydrophilicity.

AB Five heteroanionic oxybromides, LaBrMoO4,LaBrWO4, (La0.9Sm0.1)BrMoO4, (La0.9Sm0.1)BrWO4, and (La0.9Dy0.1)BrWO4, were grown by a high-temperaturesalt flux method. Millimeter-sized crystals were collected after saltflux was removed by DI water. The crystal structures were accuratelydetermined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. LaBrMoO4 is isostructural to LaBrWO4. The substitution of lanthanumfor rare earth elements does not change the crystal structure. LaBrWO4 is the first acentric tungsten-containing compound of theREBrVIO(4) (RE = Y, La-Lu; VI = Mo, W) system. Thebonding picture of LaBrWO4 was understood by crystal orbitalHamilton population calculations (COHP) and electron localizationfunction (ELF) analysis, which confirmed the uncommon 4 + 1 coordinationof tungsten surrounded by oxygen atoms. Linear optical propertiessuch as bandgaps, infrared spectrum (IR), and birefringence of thetitle compounds were recorded in this work. LaBrMoO4 exhibitsa moderate second harmonic generation (SHG) response of 0.47xKH(2)PO(4) (KDP) for incident 1064 nm radiation.LaBrWO4 and (La0.9Dy0.1)BrWO4 exhibit superior SHG responses of 1.66x KDP and 3.71xKDP for samples for incident 1064 nm radiation, respectively. Allmeasured samples exhibited type-I phase matching behavior. Densityfunction calculations (DFT) verified that the optical properties ofLaBrMoO(4) and LaBrWO4 are predominantly controlledby [VIO5](VI = Mo,W) units. Via therare earth elements Sm and Dy doping, LaBrMoO4 and LaBrWO4 emit visible lights of various wavelengths upon UV lightexcitation. The distortion of lambda-shaped one-dimensional (1D) [VIO5](VI = Mo,W) strands plays an importantrole in enhancing nonlinear optical properties and photoluminescentproperties within LaBrWO4 and (La0.9Dy0.1)BrWO4 compared with LaBrMoO4.

AB In this Letter a novel, to our knowledge, approach for near- infrared (NIR) fluorescence portable confocal microscopy is introduced, aiming to enhance fluorescence imaging of biological samples in the NIR-II window. By integrating a superconducting nanowire single-photon detector (SNSPD) into a confocal microscopy, we have significantly leveraged the detection efficiency of the NIR-II fluorescence signal from indocyanine green (ICG), an FDA-approved dye known for its NIR-II fluorescence capabilities. The SNSPD, characterized by its extremely low dark count rate and optimized NIR system detection efficiency, enables the excitation of ICG with 1 mW and the capture of low-light fluorescence signals from deep regions (up to 512 mu m). Consequently, our technique was able to produce high-resolution images of bio samples with a superior signal-to-noise ratio, making a substantial advancement in the field of fluorescence microscopy and offering a promising opportunity for future clinical study.

AB Additive manufacturing (AM) can be advanced by the diverse characteristics offered by thermoplastic and thermoset polymers and the further benefits of copolymerization. However, the availability of suitable polymeric materials for AM is limited and may not always be ideal for specific applications. Additionally, the extensive number of potential monomers and their combinations make experimental determination of resin compositions extremely time-consuming and costly. To overcome these challenges, we develop an active learning (AL) approach to effectively choose compositions in a ternary monomer space ranging from rigid to elastomeric. Our AL algorithm dynamically suggests monomer composition ratios for the subsequent round of testing, allowing us to efficiently build a robust machine learning (ML) model capable of predicting polymer properties, including Young's modulus, peak stress, ultimate strain, and Shore A hardness based on composition while minimizing the number of experiments. As a demonstration of the effectiveness of our approach, we use the ML model to drive material selection for a specific property, namely, Young's modulus. The results indicate that the ML model can be used to select material compositions within at least 10% of a targeted value of Young's modulus. We then use the materials designed by the ML model to 3D print a multimaterial "hand" with soft "skin" and rigid "bones". This work presents a promising tool for enabling informed AM material selection tailored to user specifications and accelerating material discovery using a limited monomer space.

AB The rapid development of nanomedicine has considerably advanced precision therapy for cancer treatment. Superior to traditional chemotherapy, emerging theranostic nanoprodrugs can effectively realize inherent self-tracking, targeted drug delivery, stimuli-triggered drug release, and reduced systemic toxicity of chemotherapeutic drugs. However, theranostic nanoprodrugs with real-time drug release monitoring have remained rare so far. In this work, we developed a new glutathione-responsive theranostic nanoprodrug with a high drug-loading content of 59.4 wt % and an average nanoscale size of 46 nm, consisting of the anticancer drug paclitaxel and a fluorescent imaging probe with a high fluorescence quantum yield, which are linked by a disulfide-based glutathione-sensitive self-immolating linker. The strong fluorescence emission of the fluorophore enables efficacious self-tracking and sensitive fluorescence "ON-OFF" glutathione sensing. Upon encountering high-level glutathione in cancer cells, the disulfide bond is cleaved, and the resulting linker halves spontaneously collapse into cyclic small molecules at the same pace, leading to the simultaneous release of the therapeutic drug and the fluorescence-OFF imaging probe. Thereby, the drug release process is efficiently monitored by the fluorescence change in the nanoprodrug. The nanoprodrugs exerted high cytotoxicity toward various cancer cells, especially for A549 and HEK-293 cells, in which the nanoprodrugs generated better therapeutic effects than free paclitaxel. Our work demonstrated a new modality of smart theranostic nanoprodrugs for precise cancer therapy.

AB Software projects frequently use automation tools to perform repetitive activities in the distributed software development process. Recently, GitHub introduced GitHub Actions, a feature providing automated workflows for software projects. Understanding and anticipating the effects of adopting such technology is important for planning and management. Our research investigates how projects use GitHub Actions, what the developers discuss about them, and how project activity indicators change after their adoption. Our results indicate that 1,489 out of 5,000 most popular repositories (almost 30% of our sample) adopt GitHub Actions and that developers frequently ask for help implementing them. Our findings also suggest that the adoption of GitHub Actions leads to more rejections of pull requests (PRs), more communication in accepted PRs and less communication in rejected PRs, fewer commits in accepted PRs and more commits in rejected PRs, and more time to accept a PR. We found similar results when segmenting our results by categories of GitHub Actions. We suggest practitioners consider these effects when adopting GitHub Actions on their projects.

AB Any state r = (x, y, z) of a qubit, written in the Pauli basis and initialized in the pure state r = (0, 0, 1), can be prepared by composing three quantum operations: two unitary rotation gates to reach a pure state r=x2+y2+z2-12x(x,y,z) on the Bloch sphere, followed by a depolarization gate to decrease divide r divide . Here we discuss the complementary state-preparation protocol for qubits initialized at the center of the Bloch ball, r = 0, based on increasing or amplifying divide r divide to its desired value, then rotating. Bloch vector amplification increases purity and decreases entropy. Amplification can be achieved with a linear Markovian completely positive trace-preserving (CPTP) channel by placing the channel's fixed point away from r = 0, making it nonunital, but the resulting gate suffers from a critical slowing down as that fixed point is approached. Here we consider alternative designs based on linear and nonlinear Markovian PTP channels, which offer benefits relative to linear CPTP channels, namely fast Bloch vector amplification without deceleration. These gates simulate a reversal of the thermodynamic arrow of time for the qubit and would provide striking experimental demonstrations of non-CP dynamics.

AB Accurately identifying Power Lines (PLs) is crucial for ensuring the safety of aerial vehicles. Despite the potential of recent deep learning approaches, obtaining high-quality ground truth annotations remains a challenging and labor-intensive task. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) emerges as a promising solution, leveraging knowledge from labeled synthetic data to improve performance on unlabeled real images. However, existing UDA methods often suffer of huge computation costs, limiting their deployment on real-time embedded systems commonly utilized on aerial vehicles. To mitigate this problem, this paper introduces QuadFormer, a real-time framework designed for unsupervised semantic segmentation within the UDA paradigm. QuadFormer integrates a lightweight transformer-based segmentation model with a cross-attention mechanism to narrow the gap between a labelled synthetic domain and unlabelled real domain. Furthermore, we design a novel pseudo label scheme to enhance the segmentation accuracy of the unlabelled real data. To facilitate the evaluation of our framework and promote reserach in PL segemntation, we present two new datasets: AutelPL Synthetic and AutelPL Real. Experimental results demonstrate that QuadFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on both AutelPL Synthetic -> TTPLA and AutelPL Synthetic -> AutelPL Real tasks. We will publicly release the dataset to the research community.

AB Four unsaturated poly(carbooligosilane)s(P1-P4) were prepared via acyclicdiene metathesis polycondensationof new oligosilane diene monomers (1-4). These novel polymers with varying main-chain Si incorporationhave high trans internal olefin stereochemistry (ca.80%) and molecular weights (9500-21,700 g mol(-1)). Postpolymerization epoxidation converted all alkene moieties toepoxides and rendered the polymers (P5-P8) more electrophilic, which allowed for single-molecule force spectroscopystudies via a modified atomic force microscope setup with a silicontip and cantilever. The single-chain elasticity of the polycarbooligosilanesdecreased with increasing numbers of Si-Si bonds, a findingreproduced by quantum chemical calculations.

AB Metal ions play important roles in chemistry, biochemistry, and material sciences. Accurately modeling ion solvation is crucial for simulating ion-containing systems. There are different models for ion solvation in computational chemistry, such as the explicit model, continuum model, and discrete-continuum model. Compared to the explicit model and continuum model, the discrete-continuum model of solvation is a hybrid solvation model in which the first solvation shell is described explicitly, and the remainder of the bulk liquid is characterized by a continuum model, which provides an excellent balance between accuracy and computational costs. This work serves as a systematic benchmark of the discrete-continuum model for the solvation of cations with +2, +3, and +4 charges. The calculated hydration free energies (HFEs) of ions were compared to those obtained by the SMD continuum model alone and the available experimental data. The discrete-continuum model showed improved performance over the continuum model alone via a smaller overall error and more consistent performance. Experimentally observed trends, such as the Irving-Williams series, are generally reproduced. In contrast, greater overall error was obtained for Ln3+ ions, and the HFE trend along the Ln3+ series was more difficult to reproduce, indicating these ions are challenging to model by the discrete-continuum model and continuum model. Overall, the discrete-continuum model is recommended to calculate the HFEs of cations when experimental data are not available.

AB Charge-transfer (CT) interactions between co-facially aligned pi-donor/acceptor (pi-D/A) arrays engender unique optical and electronic properties that could benefit (supra)molecular electronics and energy technologies. Herein, we demonstrate that a tetragonal prismatic metal-organic cage (MOC1(8+)) having two parallel pi-donor tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)-Zn-porphyrin (ZnTCPP) faces selectively intercalate planar pi-acceptor guests, such as hexaazatriphenylene hexacarbonitrile (HATHCN), hexacyanotriphenylene (HCTP), and napthanelediimide (NDI) derivatives, forming 1:1 pi A@MOC1(8+) inclusion complexes featuring supramolecular pi-D/A/D triads. The pi-acidity of intercalated pi-acceptors (HATHCN >> HCTP approximate to NDIs) dictated the nature and strength of their interactions with the ZnTCPP faces, which in turn influenced the binding affinities (K-a) and optical and electronic properties of corresponding pi A@MOC1(8+) inclusion complexes. Owing to its strongest CT interaction with ZnTCPP faces, the most pi-acidic HATHCN guest enjoyed the largest K-a (5 x 10(6) M-1), competitively displaced weaker pi-acceptors from the MOC1(8+) cavity, and generated the highest electrical conductivity (2.1 x 10(-6) S/m) among the pi A@MOC1(8+) inclusion complexes. This work demonstrates a unique through-space charge transport capability of pi A@MOC1(8+) inclusion complexes featuring supramolecular pi-D/A/D triads, which generated tunable electrical conductivity, which is a rare but much coveted electronic property of such supramolecular assemblies that could further expand their utility in future technologies.

AB Anthropogenic climate change is projected to drive increases in climate extremes and climate-sensitive ecosystem disturbances such as wildfire with enormous economic impacts. Understanding spatial and temporal patterns of risk to property values from climate-sensitive disturbances at national and regional scales and from multiple disturbances is urgently needed to inform risk management and policy efforts. Here, we combine models for three major climate-sensitive disturbances (i.e., wildfire, climate stress-driven tree mortality, and insect-driven tree mortality), future climate projections of these disturbances, and high-resolution property values data to quantify the spatiotemporal exposure of property values to disturbance across the contiguous United States (US). We find that property values exposed to these climate-sensitive disturbances increase sharply in future climate scenarios, particularly in existing high-risk regions of the western US, and that novel exposure risks emerge in some currently lower-risk regions such as the southeast and Great Lakes regions. Climate policy that drives emissions towards low-to-moderate climate futures avoids large increases in disturbance risk exposure compared to high emissions scenarios. Our results provide an important large-scale assessment of climate-sensitive disturbance risk to property values to help inform land management and climate adaptation efforts.

AB This work develops a systematic uncertainty quantification framework to assess the reliability of prediction delivered by physics-based material models in the presence of incomplete measurement data and modeling error. The framework consists of global sensitivity analysis, Bayesian inference, and forward propagation of uncertainty through the computational model. The implementation of this framework on a new multiphase model of novel porous silica aerogel materials is demonstrated to predict the thermomechanical performances of a building envelope insulation component. The uncertainty analyses rely on sampling methods, including Markov-chain Monte Carlo and a mixed finite element solution of the multiphase model. Notable features of this work are investigating a new noise model within the Bayesian inversion to prevent biased estimations and characterizing various sources of uncertainty, such as measurements variabilities, model inadequacy in capturing microstructural randomness, and modeling errors incurred by the theoretical model and numerical solutions.

AB Large Language Models (LLMs) have been the focus of intense interest in the past few years for the artificial intelligence (AI) community and their use in interactive robots for industry has had equal interest; however, there do not currently exist guidelines for or categorizations of their use in different application spaces. In this workshop, we bring together academic researchers and industry practitioners who are using or are interested in LLMs for human-robot interaction (HRI), and who can contribute to the development of a higher level, community-wide evaluation of how LLMs can fit correctly and defensibly into the future of HRI. Relevant topics to this workshop include HRI studies that involve LLMs directly or indirectly, technical contributions that involve utilizing or modifying LLMs, and HRI studies that utilize the idea of "Scarecrows'' [13] within a larger system. We also intend to incorporate work on the broader questions of how these models should be conceptualized within the framework of effective, responsible HRI.

AB Current dataset collection methods typically scrape large amounts of data from the web. While this technique is extremely scalable, data collected in this way tends to reinforce stereotypical biases, can contain personally identifiable information, and typically originates from Europe and North America. In this work, we rethink the dataset collection paradigm and introduce GeoDE, a geographically diverse dataset with 61,940 images from 40 classes and 6 world regions, with no personally identifiable information, collected by soliciting images from people around the world. We analyse GeoDE to understand differences in images collected in this manner compared to web-scraping. We demonstrate its use as both an evaluation and training dataset, allowing us to highlight and begin to mitigate the shortcomings in current models, despite GeoDE's relatively small size. We release the full dataset and code at https://geodiverse-data-collection.cs.princeton.edu/

AB Optically controlled high-voltage power devices are desirable for grid and renewable energy applications. This work proposes a hybrid device consisting of a high-voltage, high-power transistor, and two low-voltage, low-power photodiodes (PDs) to achieve the optically controlled power switching. This hybrid device is driven by complementary optical signals, which are applied to two PDs to charge and discharge the capacitances of the power device in the turn-OFF and turn-ON transients. This design can fast switch unipolar devices with an ultralow optical power, as only the driver signals are optically modulated but the device current is not photogenerated. We experimentally demonstrate this design using two InGaAs PDs to switch a 3.3 kV SiC MOSFET, the highest-voltage industrial unipolar device available. Under an optical power of 21.7 mW applied on each PD, 1500 V/3 A hard-switching is demonstrated with a rise time and fall time of 152 and 215 ns, respectively. This represents the highest switching voltage, fastest switching speed, and highest ratio between the power capacity and optical power reported in optically controlled unipolar power switches. The switching dynamics are also modeled to project the frequency scalability of this hybrid device. In addition to achieving a record performance, this general device design is also applicable to the future development of integrated optics for power electronics.

AB Evaluating and optimizing policies in the presence of unobserved confounders is a problem of growing interest in offline reinforcement learning. Using conventional methods for offline RL in the presence of confounding can not only lead to poor decisions and poor policies, but also have disastrous effects in critical applications such as healthcare and education. We map out the landscape of offline policy evaluation for confounded MDPs, distinguishing assumptions on confounding based on whether they are memoryless and on their effect on the data-collection policies. We characterize settings where consistent value estimates are provably not achievable, and provide algorithms with guarantees to instead estimate lower bounds on the value. When consistent estimates are achievable, we provide algorithms for value estimation with sample complexity guarantees. We also present new algorithms for offline policy improvement and prove local convergence guarantees. Finally, we experimentally evaluate our algorithms on both a gridworld environment and a simulated healthcare setting of managing sepsis patients. In gridworld, our model-based method provides tighter lower bounds than existing methods, while in the sepsis simulator, our methods significantly outperform confounder-oblivious benchmarks.

AB This work explores a novel approach for improving the sodium-ion battery performance of coal char using flash pyrolysis and an ether-based electrolyte. Coal char is an ultra-low cost hard carbon with promising application as an anode material in sodium-ion batteries. During flash pyrolysis, char is heated at 1000 degrees C/s in a drop-tube furnace to create a highly-irregular structure. The larger d-spacing and smaller closed micropore diameter of flash-pyrolyzed char increases anode capacity compared to traditional slow-pyrolyzed char electrodes. The sodium-ion battery anode performance of flash-pyrolyzed char is further improved using an ether-based electrolyte in place of the traditional ester-based electrolyte. Performance improvements include greater initial Coulombic efficiency (58% in ester- vs. 64% in ether-based electrolyte) and improved specific capacity in an ether-based electrolyte. Overall, the combination of flash pyrolysis and ether-based electrolyte increases the sodium-ion battery discharge capacity of coal char by over 50%, from 72.5 mAh g(-1) (slow-pyrolyzed char in ester-based electrolyte) to 109.4 mAh g(-1) (flash-pyrolyzed char in ether-based electrolyte) (50 mA g(-1) discharge rate). The results highlight improvements that can be realized through flash pyrolysis of coal char for battery applications and the numerous processing advantages of flash vs. slow pyrolysis.

AB Thermoplastic Polyurethane is best known for its elastic and flexible qualities. 3D printing of polyurethanes is well-evolved research for various applications including soft robotics, actuators, and origami structures. In this research, we developed a polyurethanes-based composite actuator that uses commercially available nickel-titanium alloy - Nitinol shape memory alloy. The Nitinol wire is embedded within a 3D-printed thermoplastic polyurethane substrate. 3D printing "Pause and Go" approach is used to add the pause during the printing of the specimen and insert the SMA wire. After embedding the wire, printing is continued to complete the fabrication of the specimen with embedded wire. Several design configurations were fabricated in the exploratory research to understand the impact of the geometry on the actuation. Through the experimental characterization, we observed the actuation due to external thermal and electrical stimulation. The embedded SMA regained the treated shape which ultimately demonstrated the actuation. This research explores the low-cost manufacturing of soft robotics elements which can be used in many real-life applications in medical, aerospace, and domestic appliances.

AB Implementing and evaluating eye tracking across multiple platforms and use cases can be challenging due to the lack of standardized metrics and measurements. Additionally, existing calibration methods and accuracy measurements often do not account for the common scenarios of walking and scanning in mobile AR settings. We conducted user studies evaluating eye tracking on the Magic Leap One, the Meta Quest Pro, and the HoloLens 2. Our results reveal that the degree to which locomotion influenced eye tracking performance depended on the headset, with the HoloLens 2, which features a retractable visor, displaying the greatest decrease in accuracy during locomotion.

TI ROM Inversion of Monostatic Data Lifted to Full MIMO\ast

ID MODEL
AB The Lippmann-Schwinger-Lanczos (LSL) algorithm has recently been shown to provide an efficient tool for imaging and direct inversion of synthetic aperture radar data in multiscattering environments [V. Druskin, S. Moskow, and M. Zaslavsky, SIAM J. Imaging Sci., 17 (2024), pp. 334--350], where the data set is limited to the monostatic, a.k.a. single input/single output (SISO), measurements. The approach is based on constructing data-driven estimates of internal fields via a reduced order model (ROM) framework and then plugging them into the Lippmann-Schwinger integral equation. However, the approximations of the internal solutions may have more error due to missing the off- diagonal elements of the multiple input/multiple output (MIMO) matrix valued transfer function. This, in turn, may result in multiple echoes in the image. Here we present a ROM-based data completion algorithm to mitigate this problem. First, we apply the LSL algorithm to the SISO data as in [V. Druskin, S. Moskow, and M. Zaslavsky, SIAM J. Imaging Sci., 17 (2024), pp. 334--350] to obtain approximate reconstructions as well as the estimate of internal field. Next, we use these estimates to calculate a forward Lippmann-Schwinger integral to populate the missing off-diagonal data (the lifting step). Finally, to update the reconstructions, we solve the Lippmann-Schwinger equation using the original SISO data, where the internal fields are constructed from the lifted MIMO data. The steps of obtaining the approximate reconstructions and internal fields and populating the missing MIMO data entries can be repeated for complex models to improve the images even further. Efficiency of the proposed approach is demonstrated on two-dimensional and 2.5-dimensional numerical examples, where we see reconstructions are improved substantially.

DE Continual Learning; Efficiency; Optimization; Model Sparsity
AB A key challenge in the continual learning setting is to efficiently learn a sequence of tasks without forgetting how to perform previously learned tasks. Many existing approaches to this problem work by either retraining the model on previous tasks or by expanding the model to accommodate new tasks. However, these approaches typically suffer from increased storage and computational requirements, a problem that is worsened in the case of sparse models due to need for expensive re-training after sparsification. To address this challenge, we propose a new method for efficient continual learning of sparse models (EsaCL) that can automatically prune redundant parameters without adversely impacting the model's predictive power, and circumvent the need of retraining. We conduct a theoretical analysis of loss landscapes with parameter pruning, and design a directional pruning (SDP) strategy that is informed by the sharpness of the loss function with respect to the model parameters. SDP ensures model with minimal loss of predictive accuracy, accelerating the learning of sparse models at each stage. To accelerate model update, we introduce an intelligent data selection (IDS) strategy that can identify critical instances for estimating loss landscape, yielding substantially improved data efficiency. The results of our experiments show that EsaCL achieves performance that is competitive with the state-of-the-art methods.

AB Conservation tillage has been promoted as an effective practice to preserve soil health and enhance agroecosystem services. Changes in tillage intensity have a profound impact on soil nitrogen cycling, yet their influence on nitrate losses at large spatiotemporal scales remains uncertain. This study examined the effects of tillage intensity on soil nitrate losses in the US Midwest from 1979-2018 using field data synthesis and process-based agroecosystem modeling approaches. Our results revealed that no-tillage (NT) or reduced tillage intensity (RTI) decreased nitrate runoff but increased nitrate leaching compared to conventional tillage. These trade-offs were largely caused by altered water fluxes, which elevated total nitrate losses. The structural equation model suggested that precipitation had more pronounced effects on nitrate leaching and runoff than soil properties (i.e. texture, pH, and bulk density). Reduction in nitrate runoff under NT or RTI was negatively correlated with precipitation, and the increased nitrate leaching was positively associated with soil bulk density. We further explored the combined effects of NT or RTI and winter cover crops and found that incorporating winter cover crops into NT systems effectively reduced nitrate runoff but did not significantly affect nitrate leaching. Our findings underscore the precautions of implementing NT or RTI to promote sustainable agriculture under changing climate conditions. This study provides valuable insights into the complex relationship between tillage intensity and nitrate loss pathways, contributing to informed decision-making in climate-smart agriculture.

AB The search for materials to treat wastewater is especially crucial. Herein, we have prepared 1D molybdenum oxide (MoO3) nanobelts through a hydrothermal approach. The binary (MoO3/SiO2) and ternary composites of MoO3/SiO2/MXene were synthesized via ultrasonication route. The as-prepared MoO3, MoO3/SiO2, and MoO3/SiO2/MXene composites were employed to investigate the photocatalytic behavior of two organic dyes, methyl orange (MO) and crystal violet (CV). The % degradation of MO in the presence of MoO3 nanobelts and MoO3/SiO2 was calculated to be 48.9 % and 74.4 %, respectively. In the case of CV dye, the degradation (%) was observed at 53.7 % and 75.9 %. The MoO3/SiO2/MXene composite revealed the best photocatalytic behavior against both MO and CV dyes by removing 94.7 % and 97.7 % under visible light irradiation. The rate constant values of MoO3 nanobelts, MoO3/SiO2 and MoO3/SiO2/MXene composite for MO dye were calculated to be 0.00568 min(-1), 0.01156 min(-1), and 0.02399 min(-1) and for CV dye 0.00679 min(-1), 0.01208 min(-1), and 0.02798 min(-1) respectively. A scavenging test was carried out to monitor the main photo-active species that take part during the photocatalysis and hydroxyl radicals were found to be the highly active species during whole photodegradation progression. The SiO2 particles function as a good adsorbent medium and transfer the adsorbed organics toward more active sites to advance the reaction. 2D MXene nanosheets, as good conductors, reduce the recombination rate of charges, offer large surface area, and facilitate fast transfer of charges. The results suggest that MoO3/SiO2/MXene composite is a potential contender for wastewater remediation applications.

AB Standard learning assessments like multiple-choice questions measure what students know but not how their knowledge is organized. Recent advances in cognitive network science provide quantitative tools for modeling the structure of semantic memory, revealing key learning mechanisms. In two studies, we examined the semantic memory networks of undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory psychology course. In Study 1, we administered a cumulative multiple-choice test of psychology knowledge, the Intro Psych Test, at the end of the course. To estimate semantic memory networks, we administered two verbal fluency tasks: domain-specific fluency (naming psychology concepts) and domain-general fluency (naming animals). Based on their performance on the Intro Psych Test, we categorized students into a high-knowledge or low-knowledge group, and compared their semantic memory networks. Study 1 (N = 213) found that the high-knowledge group had semantic memory networks that were more clustered, with shorter distances between concepts-across both the domain-specific (psychology) and domain-general (animal) categories-compared to the low-knowledge group. In Study 2 (N = 145), we replicated and extended these findings in a longitudinal study, collecting data near the start and end of the semester. In addition to replicating Study 1, we found the semantic memory networks of high-knowledge students became more interconnected over time, across both domain-general and domain-specific categories. These findings suggest that successful learners show a distinct semantic memory organization-characterized by high connectivity and short path distances between concepts-highlighting the utility of cognitive network science for studying variation in student learning.

AB Alginate hydrogels have garnered significant attention due to their promising applications in the food, biomedical, and pharmaceutical industries. The detection and quantification of distinct water phases within these hydrogels offer valuable insights into their dynamic, absorptive, and mechanical properties. Despite being comprised solely of 2 wt % polymeric materials, the alginate hydrogels exhibit a highly porous morphology, characterized by distinct water pools exhibiting varying mobility and dynamic behaviors. These phases can be delineated as largely free water phase with high mobility, which occupies the macropores, and bound water with restricted mobility, which interacts with the fibrous polymeric structure. Water pools interacting with their surrounding environments possess variable crystal structures on variable freezing points, this could be easily detected using X-ray scattering techniques. A comparative study was conducted based on the information derived from each technique, with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) yielding quantitative information for the water phases in alginate hydrogels (i.e., 58 % free and 42 % bound water in 0.75 wt % - 6 h aging sample), whereas cryogenic scanning electron microscopy (Cryo-SEM), wide and small-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS and SAXS), Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR), and rheology provided valuable qualitative insights. In this study, deep insights into the molecular structure of alginates were obtained including the alteration in morphology and macropore distribution, increase in the wall thickness, density, and mechanical properties upon increasing the Ca2+ concentration and aging period.

AB The human arm has an intrinsic capacity to absorb energy during physical human-robot interaction (pHRI), which can be identified as biomechanical excess of passivity (EoP). This can be used as a central factor in the development of passivity-based pHRI controllers securing haptic transparency while guaranteeing pHRI stability. Despite its significance, the real-time estimation of EoP remains an under-investigated topic. For the first time, we investigate the relationship between the EoP and muscle activity of the forearm at the wrist joint while analyzing sixteen surface electromyography (sEMG) sensors. The letter explores optimal sensor placement for maximizing the correlation between muscle activity and the estimated EoP. Ten subjects participated in this study. The EoP of the wrist was identified through high-frequency perturbations in four directions, and two instructed co-contraction levels. The results uncover a strong correlation between sEMG and EoP. This paper also reports the effect of the direction of pHRI interaction on the EoP of the wrist, with increased energetic passivity in the abduction-adduction direction compared to supination-pronation. Also, the study investigated the effect of the observation duration for sEMG on the sEMG-EoP correlation (short windows would be required for real-time applications). Although the correlation decreases for shorter windows, it remains relatively high, supporting dynamic estimation of EoP in real-time. Additionally, we found that sEMG sensors near the wrist have the highest correlation with EoP for short windows. The findings of this letter indicate that sEMG encodes significant potential for real-time estimation of EoP in the design of next-generation pHRI controllers supporting concurrent transparency and stability.

AB We report the intramolecular 1,n-aminoboration for the simultaneous synthesis of aza-heterocycles with distal carbon-boron bonds. Pd-catalyzed remote 1,n-aminoboration occurs with 1,2-disubstituted alkenes; upon aminopalladation of the olefin, chain walking generates the terminal Pd-alkyl intermediate, which selectively undergoes Fe-catalyzed borylation. Terminal bishomoallylic amines, amides, carbamates, and ureas afford the borylated pyrrolidines and lactams through 1,2-aminoboration. Forty-one examples of 1,n-borylated heterocycles are presented with yields up to 92%. Derivatization of the products is explored: cross-coupling, amination, and oxidation to access unnatural amino alcohols and acids.

AB Empathy research has long emphasized accuracy when imagining other minds. We explore whether empathy can be a creative process, where people think of multiple diverging possibilities of others' experiences. We developed two tasks to measure creative empathy. First, we adapted "forward flow" to measure the dynamic unfolding of creativity while imagining other minds, quantified as semantic distance between mental state concepts when freely associating the contents of other minds. Second, we developed a divergent thinking task where participants reflect on others' mental states and responses are scored using subjective and automated methods. In Studies 1-3, participants instructed to "be creative" showed higher scores than those instructed to be accurate and a no-instruction control, demonstrating that people vary in how creatively they approach empathy. In Study 4, participants instructed to be empathic (vs. objective) toward a target showed greater creativity on the divergent thinking task, demonstrating that empathy can produce creativity. Creativity on these tasks were inconsistently associated with trait and state empathy measures, suggesting complex relationships between creative empathy and empathic outcomes. Overall, these findings support a novel approach to measuring empathy that accounts for creative processes, broadening the scope of empathy and creativity research.

AB Retrieval and recommendation are two essential tasks in modern search tools. This paper introduces a novel retrieval-reranking framework leveraging large language models to enhance the spatiotemporal and semantic associated mining and recommendation of relevant, unusual climate and environmental events described in news articles and web posts. This framework uses advanced natural language processing techniques to address the limitations of traditional manual curation methods in terms of high labor costs and lack of scalability. Specifically, we explore an optimized solution to employ cutting-edge embedding models for semantically analyzing spatiotemporal events (news) and propose a Geo-Time Re-ranking strategy that integrates multi-faceted criteria including spatial proximity, temporal association, semantic similarity, and category-instructed similarity to rank and identify similar spatiotemporal events. We apply the proposed framework to a dataset of four thousand local environmental observer network events, achieving top performance on recommending similar events among multiple cutting-edge dense retrieval models. The search and recommendation pipeline can be applied to a wide range of similar data search tasks dealing with geospatial and temporal data. We hope that by linking relevant events, we can better aid the general public to gain enhanced understanding on climate change and its impact on different communities.

AB Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has recently emerged as a new concept which allows for capitalizing on the strengths of graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn rich representations in a wide variety of applications which involve abundant unlabeled information. However, existing GCL approaches largely tend to overlook the important latent information on higher-order graph substructures. We address this limitation by introducing the concepts of topological invariance and extended persistence on graphs to GCL. In particular, we propose a new contrastive mode which targets topological representations of the two augmented views from the same graph, yielded by extracting latent shape properties of the graph at multiple resolutions. Along with the extended topologi-cal layer, we introduce a new extended persistence summary, namely, extended persistence landscapes (EPL) and derive its theoretical stability guarantees. Our extensive numerical results on biological, chemical, and social interaction graphs show that the new Topological Graph Contrastive Learning (TopoGCL) model delivers significant performance gains in unsupervised graph classification for 8 out of 12 considered datasets and also exhibits robustness under noisy scenarios.

DE RNA tertiary structure; RNA structure prediction; full atomic
   reconstruction; structure refinement; coarse-grained structure
AB RNA tertiary structures from experiments or computational predictions often contain missing atoms, which prevent analyses requiring full atomic structures. Current programs for RNA reconstruction can be slow, inaccurate, and/or require specific atoms to be present in the input. We present Arena (Atomic Recon-struction of RNA), which reconstructs a full atomic RNA structure from residues that can have as few as one atom. Arena first fills in missing atoms and then iteratively refines their placement to reduce non -ideal geometries. We benchmarked Arena on a dataset of 361 RNA structures, where Arena achieves high accuracy and speed compared to other structure reconstruction programs. For example, Arena was used to reconstruct full atomic structures from a single phosphorus atom per nucleotide to, on aver-age, within 3.63 A & DBLBOND; RMSD of the experimental structure, while virtually removing all clashes and running in <3 s, which is 353x and 46x faster than state-of-the-art programs PDBFixer and C2A, respectively.

Representing the often deep uncertainties influencing these risks poses nontrivial challenges. A common uncertainty characterization approach is to use a few benchmark cases to represent the range and relative probabilities of the set of possible outcomes. This has been done in coastal adaptation studies, for example, by using low, moderate, and high percentiles of an input of interest, like sea-level changes. A key consideration is how this simplified characterization of uncertainty influences the distributions of estimated coastal impacts. Here, we show that using only a few benchmark percentiles to represent uncertainty in future sea-level change can lead to overconfident projections and underestimate high-end risks as compared to using full ensembles for sea-level change and socioeconomic parametric uncertainties. When uncertainty in future sea level is characterized by low, moderate, and high percentiles of global mean sea-level rise, estimates of high-end (95th percentile) damages are underestimated by between 18% (SSP1-2.6) and 46% (SSP5-8.5). Additionally, using the 5th and 95th percentiles of sea-level scenarios underestimates the 5%-95% width of the distribution of adaptation costs by a factor ranging from about two to four, depending on SSP-RCP pathway. The resulting underestimation of the uncertainty range in adaptation costs can bias adaptation and mitigation decision-making.

ID RECONFIGURABLE INTELLIGENT SURFACES
AB In this letter, in order to achieve higher spectral and energy efficiency, we propose a novel cost-efficient transmitter conceptual design based on reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) with discrete phase shifts. The key idea is to directly utilize the digital signal to adjust the discrete reflection coefficients of RIS, resulting that the phases of the reflected carrier signal being modulated without the need for complex digital signal processing (DSP) hardware and costly radio frequency (RF) chains. Furthermore, a joint digital modulation and beamforming method is developed to enable information transmission as well as enhance signal strength. Based on the proposed transmitter, we derive the closed-form expressions of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and bit error rate (BER) of the received signal and analyze the impact of hardware constraints on communication performance. Extensive simulation results validate that the novel design of RIS-assisted transmitter provides a cost-effective and power-efficient solution for wireless communications.

TI Disrupting the Master Narrative in Academic Biology as LGBTQ plus Ph.D.

ID IDENTITY DEVELOPMENT; IMPACT; GAY
AB LGBTQ+ individuals face discrimination and stigma in academic biology. These challenges are likely magnified for graduate students. However, there have been no studies documenting the experiences of LGBTQ+ life sciences graduate students. To address this gap, we conducted an interview study of 22 biology PhD students from 13 universities across the United States who identify as LGBTQ+. We used the master narrative framework to interpret our findings. Master narratives are guidelines that dictate the "expected" and "normal" way one is supposed to navigate life. We considered how graduate students engage with the societal master narrative that treats cisheterosexuality as the norm, as well as the master narrative that expects biology to remain an objective, apolitical space. We found that LGBTQ+ PhD students recognize the anti-LBGTQ+ narratives in academic biology, which can result in instances of discrimination and encourage them to conceal their identities. However, participants pushed back against these master narratives. Graduate students described creating alternative narratives by highlighting how their LGBTQ+ identity has allowed them to become more inclusive instructors and better researchers. Some also purposely reveal their LGBTQ+ identity in academic biology, violating the master narrative that non-science identities should not be discussed in the life sciences.

TI Synthesis of polyaniline-coated composite anion exchange membranes based

ID SURFACE MODIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; FILM; NANOCOMPOSITES; TRANSPORT
AB The increasing need to tackle major societal challenges such as environmental sustainability and resource scarcity has heightened global interest in green and efficient separation technologies. The separation of organic acids, particularly tartaric acid, holds significant industrial importance in the food and pharmaceutical sectors. Purifying tartaric acid is crucial due to its roles as a chiral catalyst, antioxidant, and stabilizer, which are vital for ensuring product quality and efficiency. In this study, we synthesized heterogeneous anion exchange membranes by casting a solution of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) homogeneously dispersed with micronized anion exchange resin [polystyrene-divinylbenzene-trimethyl ammonium chloride (PS-DVB-TAC)]. These membranes were further coated with polyaniline (PANI) through in situ polymerization at different time intervals such as 2, 12, and 24 h. Cation exchange membranes were also prepared by solution casting of PAN dispersed with micronized cation exchange resin, sulfonated poly-styrene-co-divinylbenzene, and SPS-DVB. These synthesized anion exchange membranes with and without a PANI coating were examined for their separation performance of tartaric acid, along with the cation exchange membranes in a four-compartment electrodialyser at a constant voltage. The newly fabricated membranes were characterized by different techniques, including attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy for functional group analysis, scanning electron microscopy for their surface morphology, and the four-probe method for electrical conductivity. In addition, ion exchange capacity and water uptake have been measured. The electrodialysis experiments showed that 14.82 wt% of tartrate ions moved into the product compartment through the uncoated anion exchange membrane within 30 min at a voltage of 30 V. Under the same conditions, membranes coated with PANI at 2, 12, and 24 h raised the separation efficiency to 21.19%, 34.13%, and 37.21%, respectively. Findings indicate that membranes coated with PANI for extended periods demonstrate superior separation efficiency for tartaric acid. Consequently, this energy-efficient method shows significant potential for application in the food and pharmaceutical industries for separating tartaric acid and other organic and amino acids. This research can advance practical and sustainable separation technologies, addressing critical societal issues like resource efficiency and environmental sustainability.

AB Hydrogen-atom (H-atom) transfer at the surface of heterogeneous metal oxides has received significant attention owing to its relevance in energy conversion and storage processes. Here, we present the synthesis and characterization of an organofunctionalized polyoxovanadate cluster, (calix) V6O5(OH2)(OMe)(8) (calix = 4-tert-butylcalix[4]arene). Through a series of equilibrium studies, we establish the BDFE(O-H)(avg) of the aquo ligand as 62.4 +/- 0.2 kcal mol(-1), indicating substantial bond weaking of water upon coordination to the cluster surface. Subsequent kinetic isotope effect studies and Eyring analysis indicate the mechanism by which the hydrogenation of organic substrates occurs proceeds through a concerted proton-electron transfer from the aquo ligand. Atomistic resolution of surface reactivity presents a novel route of hydrogenation reactivity from metal oxide surfaces through H-atom transfer from surface-bound water molecules.

AB Nanofluidics has made significant impacts and advancements in various fields, including ultrafiltration, water desalination, biomedical applications, and energy conversion. These advancements are driven by the distinct behavior of fluids at the nanoscale, where the solid-fluid interaction characteristic lengthscale is in the same order of magnitude as the flow conduits. A key challenge in nanofluidics is understanding hydrodynamic slip, a phenomenon in which fluids flow past solid boundaries with a non-zero surface velocity, deviating from the classical no-slip boundary condition. This review consolidates experimental, computational, and theoretical efforts to elucidate the mechanisms behind hydrodynamic slip in nanoconfined flows. Key experimental methods, such as the surface force apparatus, atomic force microscopy, and micro-particle image velocimetry are evaluated alongside emerging techniques like suspended microchannel resonators, dynamic quartz crystal microbalance, and hybrid graphene/silica nanochannels, which have advanced hydrodynamic slip characterization at the nanoscale. In addition to direct slip measurement techniques, methods like sum frequency generation spectroscopy, X-ray reflectometry, and ellipsometry are discussed for their roles in probing solid-liquid interfacial interactions, shedding light on the origins of hydrodynamic slip. The review also highlights the contributions of molecular dynamics simulations, including both non-equilibrium (NEMD) and equilibrium (EMD) approaches, in modeling interfacial phenomena and slip behavior. Additionally, it explores the influence of factors such as surface wettability, shear rate, and confinement on slip, emphasizing the interaction between liquid structuring and solid-liquid interactions. Advancements made so far have uncovered more complexities in nanoconfined flows which have not been considered in the past, inviting more investigation to fully understand and control fluid behavior at the molecular level.

AB Electric distribution networks increasingly host distributed energy resources based on power electronic converter (PEC) toward active distribution networks (ADN). Despite advances in computational capabilities, electromagnetic transient models are limited in scalability because of their reliance on exact data about the distribution system and each of its components. Similarly, the use of the DER_A model, which is intended to examine the combined dynamic behavior of many DERs, is limited by the difficulty in parameterization. There is a need for improved dynamic models of DERs for use in large power system simulations for stability analysis. This paper proposes an aggregate model-free, data-driven approach for deriving a dynamic partitioned model (DPM) of ADNs. Detailed residential distribution feeders were first developed, including PEC-based DERs and composite load models (CMLDs), from which the aggregated DPM was derived. The performance was evaluated through various case studies and validated against the detailed ADN model and state-of-the-art DER_A model with CMLD. The data-driven DPM achieved a fitpercent${\it fitpercent}$ of over 90%, accurately representing the aggregated dynamic behavior of ADNs. Furthermore, the DPM significantly accelerated the simulation process with a computational speedup of 68 times compared to the detailed ADN and a 3.5 times speedup compared to the DER_A CMLD model.
   Design of an aggregate data-driven DPM to represent the dynamic behavior of a dynamic LVDN. Developed of a new detailed single-phase and three-phase LVDN benchmark model that consist PECs-based DERs with IEEE 1547-2018 standard GSFs and CMLD and demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed DPM approach through comparison with the state-of-the-art DER_A with CMLD model. image

AB This paper presents a method to leverage arbitrary neural network architecture for control variates. Control variates are crucial in reducing the variance of Monte Carlo integration, but they hinge on finding a function that both correlates with the integrand and has a known analytical integral. Traditional approaches rely on heuristics to choose this finiction, which might not be expressive enough to correlate well with the integrand. Recent research alleviates this issue by modeling the integrands with a learnable parametric model, such as a neural network. However, the challenge remains in creating an expressive parametric model with a known analytical integral. This paper proposes a novel approach to construct learnable parametric control variates functions from arbitrary neural network architectures. Instead of using a network to approximate the integrand directly, we employ the network to approximate the anti-derivative of the integrand. This allows us to use automatic differentiation to create a function whose integration can be constructed by the antiderivative network. We apply our method to solve partial differential equations using the Walk-on sphere a lgorilion [Sawhney and Crane 2020]. Our results indicate that this approach is unbiased using various network architectures and achieves lower variance than other control variate methods.

AB Textile fabrics have unique mechanical properties, which make them ideal candidates for many engineering and medical applications: They are initially flexible, nonlinearly stiffening, and ultra-anisotropic. Various studies have characterized the response of textile structures to mechanical loading; yet, our understanding of their exceptional properties and functions remains incomplete. Here we integrate biaxial testing and constitutive neural networks to automatically discover the best model and parameters to characterize warp knitted polypropylene fabrics. We use experiments from different mounting orientations, and discover interpretable anisotropic models that perform well during both training and testing. Our study shows that constitutive models for warp knitted fabrics are highly sensitive to an accurate representation of the textile microstructure, and that models with three microstructural directions outperform classical orthotropic models with only two in-plane directions. Strikingly, out of 2 14 = 16,384 possible combinations of terms, we consistently discover models with two exponential linear fourth invariant terms that inherently capture the initial flexibility of the virgin mesh and the pronounced nonlinear stiffening as the loops of the mesh tighten. We anticipate that the tools we have developed and prototyped here will generalize naturally to other textile fabrics-woven or knitted, weft knit or warp knit, polymeric or metallic-and, ultimately, will enable the robust discovery of anisotropic constitutive models for a wide variety of textile structures. Beyond discovering constitutive models, we envision to exploit automated model discovery as a novel strategy for the generative material design of wearable devices, stretchable electronics, and smart fabrics, as programmable textile metamaterials with tunable properties and functions.

AB Mechanical force drives distinct chemical reactions; yet, its vectoral nature results in complicated coupling with reaction trajectories. Here, we utilize a physical organic model inspired by the classical Morse potential and its differential forms to identify effective force constant (keff) eff ) and reaction energy (DE) D E) as key molecular features that govern mechanochemical kinetics. Through a comprehensive experimental and computational investigation with four norborn-2-en-7-one (NEO) mechanophores, we establish the relationship between these features and the force-dependent energetic changes along the reaction pathways. We show that the complex kinetic behavior of the tensioned bonds is generally and quantitatively predicted by a simple multivariate linear regression based on the two easily computed features with a straightforward workflow. These results demonstrate a general mechanistic framework for mechanochemical reactions under tensile force and provide a highly accessible tool for the large-scale computational screening in the design of mechanophores.

TI Eco-conscious upcycling of sugarcane bagasse into flexible polyurethane

ID FIBER
AB This study explores the use of sugarcane bagasse (SCB), a byproduct of sugarcane processing, as a bio-filler in the production of flexible polyurethane foam (FPU), focusing on its benefits for both the environment and the economy. By varying the inclusion of SCB waste from 1 to 6 wt%, the research aims to enhance the FPU's mechanical and acoustic characteristics. Techniques such as Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) were utilized to analyze the chemical structure and surface characteristics of both SCB and the FPU/SCB composites. Additionally, tests on gel fraction, density, and mechanical properties were conducted. The results indicate that adding 4 wt% SCB to FPU considerably improved the foam's properties. This modification resulted in a 148.63% increase in apparent density, a 228.47% rise in compressive strength, and a 116.24% boost in tensile strength. Furthermore, sound absorption across various frequency ranges was enhanced compared to the control foam. Additionally, the findings show that SCB effectively shifts sound absorption characteristics to lower frequencies. Specifically, at a low frequency of 500 Hz, the sound absorption coefficient increased to 0.4 with a foam thickness of 20 mm. This demonstrates that SCB can significantly improve FPU's performance, making it an attractive option for applications requiring noise mitigation, such as in the automotive and construction industries, thereby offering a sustainable solution to waste management and materials innovation.

AB Stemming from the high-profile publication of Nissen and Wolski (N Engl J Med 356:2457-2471, 2007) and subsequent discussions with divergent views on how to handle observed zero-total-event studies, defined to be studies that observe zero number of event in both treatment and control arms, the research topic concerning the common odds ratio model with zero-total-event studies remains to be an unresolved problem in meta-analysis. In this article, we address this problem by proposing a novel repro samples method to handle zero-total-event studies and make inference for the common odds ratio. The development explicitly accounts for the sampling scheme that generates the observed data and does not rely on any large sample approximations. It is theoretically justified with a guaranteed finite-sample performance. Simulation studies are designed to demonstrate the empirical performance of the proposed method. It shows that the proposed confidence set, although a little conservative, achieves the desired empirical coverage rate in all situations. The development also shows that the zero-total-event studies contain meaningful information and impact the inference for the common odds ratio. The proposed method is used to perform a meta-analysis of the 48 trials reported in Nissen and Wolski (N Engl J Med 356:2457-2471, 2007) as well

AB We investigate the impact of a mean field model for the alpha ll dynamo potentially active in the postmerger phase of a binary neutron star coalescence. We do so by deriving equations for ideal general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics with an additional alpha term, which closely resemble their Newtonian counterpart, but remain compatible with standard numerical relativity simulations. We propose a heuristic dynamo closure relation for the magnetorotational instability-driven turbulent dynamo in the outer layers of a differentially rotating magnetar remnant and its accretion disk. As a first demonstration, we apply this framework to the early stages of post-merger evolution (less than or similar to 50 ms). We demonstrate that depending on the efficacy of the dynamo action, magnetically driven outflows can be present with their amount of baryon loading correlating with the magnetic field amplification. These outflows can also contain precursor flaring episodes before settling into a quasisteady state. For the dynamo parameters explored in this work, we observe electromagnetic energy fluxes of up to 1050 erg/s, although larger amplification parameters will likely lead to stronger fluxes. Our results are consistent with the expectation that substantial dynamo amplification (either during or after the merger) may be necessary for neutron-star remnants to power short gamma-ray bursts or precursors thereof.

AB Under isothermal conditions, phase transitions occur through a nucleation event when conditions are sufficiently close to coexistence. The formation of a nucleus of the new phase requires the system to overcome a free energy barrier of formation, whose height rapidly rises as supersaturation decreases. This phenomenon occurs both in the bulk and under confinement and leads to a very slow kinetics for the transition, ultimately resulting in hysteresis, where the system can remain in a metastable state for a long time. This has broad implications, for instance, when using simulations to predict phase diagrams or screen porous materials for gas storage applications. Here, we leverage simulations in an adiabatic statistical ensemble, known as adiabatic grand-isochoric ensemble (mu, V, L) ensemble, to reach equilibrium states with a greater efficiency than its isothermal counterpart, i.e., simulations in the grand-canonical ensemble. For the bulk, we show that at low supersaturation, isothermal simulations converge slowly, while adiabatic simulations exhibit a fast convergence over a wide range of supersaturation. We then focus on adsorption and desorption processes in nanoporous materials, assess the reliability of (mu, V, L) simulations on the adsorption of argon in IRMOF-1, and demonstrate the efficiency of adiabatic simulations to predict efficiently the equilibrium loading during the adsorption and desorption of argon in MCM-41, a system that exhibits significant hysteresis. We provide quantitative measures of the increased rate of convergence when using adiabatic simulations. Adiabatic simulations explore a wide temperature range, leading to a more efficient exploration of the configuration space.

AB The automatic transfer vehicle (ATV) Jules Verne, developed by the European Space Agency, played a crucial role in resupply missions to the International Space Station from 2008 to 2015. Following its resupply missions, Jules Verne was programmed to execute a planned destructive reentry into Earth's atmosphere. To better understand the spectra generated by the Jules Verne, three-dimensional hypersonic flowfield and radiation analyses are performed at the 75 km trajectory point of the ATV. Results are compared to measurements obtained at 78 and 73 km by a miniature Echelle spectrograph operated from an airborne platform. Incorporating three-dimensional effects into the radiation analysis results in an overall reduction of the total radiation spectra and a decrease in atomic and molecular features, leading to a closer alignment between the observed and simulated values. Comparable effects are observed by making minor adjustments to the internal mode temperatures and modifying the model for the population of excited state number densities.

AB Premise Allopolyploidy-a hybridization-induced whole-genome duplication event-has been a major driver of plant diversification. The extent to which chromosomes pair with their proper homolog vs. with their homoeolog in allopolyploids varies across taxa, and methods to detect homoeologous gene flow (HGF) are needed to understand how HGF has shaped polyploid lineages. Methods The ABBA-BABA test represents a classic method for detecting introgression between closely related species, but here we developed a modified use of the ABBA-BABA test to characterize the extent and direction of HGF in allotetraploid Coffea arabica. Results We found that HGF is abundant in the C. arabica genome, with both subgenomes serving as donors and recipients of variation. We also found that HGF is highly maternally biased in plastid-targeted-but not mitochondrial-targeted-genes, as would be expected if plastid-nuclear incompatibilities exist between the two parent species. Discussion Together, our analyses provide a simple framework for detecting HGF and new evidence consistent with selection favoring overwriting of paternally derived alleles by maternally derived alleles to ameliorate plastid-nuclear incompatibilities. Natural selection therefore appears to shape the direction and intensity of HGF in allopolyploid coffee, indicating that cytoplasmic inheritance has long-term consequences for polyploid lineages.

AB This work concerns the development of deep networks that are certifiably robust to adversarial attacks. Joint robust classification-detection was recently introduced as a certified defense mechanism, where adversarial examples are either correctly classified or assigned to the "abstain" class. In this work, we show that such a provable framework can benefit by extension to networks with multiple explicit abstain classes, where the adversarial examples are adaptively assigned to those. We show that naively adding multiple abstain classes can lead to "model degeneracy", then we propose a regularization approach and a training method to counter this degeneracy by promoting full use of the multiple abstain classes. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently achieves favorable standard vs. robust verified accuracy tradeoffs, outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms for various choices of number of abstain classes. Our code is available at https://github.com/sinaBaharlouei/MultipleAbstainDetection.

TI Can quasicircular mergers of charged black holes produce extremal black
   holes?
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
LA English
DT Article
AB In contrast to energy and angular momentum, electric charge is conserved in mergers of charged black holes. This opens up the possibility for the remnant to have Kerr-Newman parameterx2 + A2 greater than 1 (with x and A being the black hole dimensionless spin and dimensionless charge, respectively), which is forbidden by the cosmic censorship conjecture. In this paper, we investigate whether a naked singularity can form in quasicircular mergers of charged binary black holes. We extend a theoretical model to estimate the final properties of the remnant left by quasicircular mergers of binary black holes to the charged case. We validate the model with numerical-relativity simulations, finding agreement at the percent level. We then use our theoretical model to argue that while naked singularities cannot form following quasicircular mergers of nonspinning charged binary black holes, it is possible to produce remnants that are arbitrarily close to the extremal limit.

AB Phosphine oxides and arsine oxides feature highly polarized pnictoryl groups (Pn(+)-O-/Pn = O; Pn = P, As) and react as Bronsted bases through O-centered lone pairs. We recently reported the first example of a monomeric stibine oxide, Dipp(3)SbO (Dipp = diisopropylphenyl), allowing periodic trends in pnictoryl bonding to be extended to antimony for the first time. Computational studies suggest that, as the pnictogen atom becomes heavier, delocalization of electron density from the O-centered lone pairs to the Pn-C & sigma;* orbitals is attenuated, destabilizing the lone pairs and increasing the donor capacity of the pnictine oxide. Herein, we assess the Bronsted basicity of a series of monomeric pnictine oxides (Dipp(3)PnO; Pn = P, As, and Sb). Stoichiometric reactivity between Dipp(3)PnO and a series of acids demonstrates the greatly enhanced ability of Dipp(3)SbO to accept protons relative to the lighter congeners, consistent with theoretical isodesmic reaction enthalpies and proton affinities. H-1 NMR spectrometric titrations allow for the pK(aH,MeCN) determination of Dipp(3)AsO and Dipp(3)SbO, revealing a 10(6)-fold increase in Bronsted basicity from Dipp(3)AsO to Dipp(3)SbO. The increased basicity can be exploited in catalysis; Dipp(3)SbO exhibits dramatically increased catalytic efficiency in the Bronsted base-catalyzed transesterification between p-nitrophenyl acetate and 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol. Our results unambiguously confirm the drastic increase in Bronsted basicity from Dipp(3)PO < Dipp(3)AsO < Dipp(3)SbO, a direct consequence of the variation in the electronic structure of the pnictoryl bond as the pnictogen atom increases in atomic number.

AB The satellite-ground integrated network (SGIN), consisting of satellites and ground base stations, is regarded as the trend to solve the problem of global coverage. However, highly dynamic scenarios pose great challenges to users' mobility management, especially handover decisions. With the rapid development of machine learning, reinforcement learning (RL), such as Q-learning and deep Q-network (DQN), has been applied to handover decision making owing to being good at solving dynamic multi-attribute optimization problems. However, Q-learning can be a waste of storage for large state spaces. Besides, the existing algorithms for training a neural network in a deep RL framework have problems of slow convergence or unstable convergence performance. Therefore, we propose a handover method exploiting the DQN framework of adaptive learning rate with momentum (DQN-ALrM), which can not only improve decision accuracy, but also improve learning efficiency. The customized DQN framework can solve problems with a large-size state space, and the proposed ALrM method can adjust the learning rate at any time according to the training error situation. Comprehensive simulations are conducted to validate the superiority of the proposed method in convergence speed, handover rate, call failure rate and multi-metric quality of service (QoS) over the alternative solutions in the literature.

AB Procedural models (i.e. symbolic programs that output visual data) are a historically-popular method for representing graphics content: vegetation, buildings, textures, etc. They offer many advantages: interpretable design parameters, stochastic variations, high-quality outputs, compact representation, and more. But they also have some limitations, such as the difficulty of authoring a procedural model from scratch. More recently, AI-based methods, and especially neural networks, have become popular for creating graphic content. These techniques allow users to directly specify desired properties of the artifact they want to create (via examples, constraints, or objectives), while a search, optimization, or learning algorithm takes care of the details. However, this ease of use comes at a cost, as it's often hard to interpret or manipulate these representations. In this state-of-the-art report, we summarize research on neurosymbolic models in computer graphics: methods that combine the strengths of both AI and symbolic programs to represent, generate, and manipulate visual data. We survey recent work applying these techniques to represent 2D shapes, 3D shapes, and materials & textures. Along the way, we situate each prior work in a unified design space for neurosymbolic models, which helps reveal underexplored areas and opportunities for future research.

AB Nowadays, graph neural networks (GNN) are the primary machinery to tackle (semi)-supervised graph classification tasks. The aim here is to predict classes for unlabeled graphs, given a collection of graphs with known labels. However, in many real-world applications, the available information on graph classes may be distorted either due to incorrect labeling process (e.g., as in biochemistry and bioinformatics) or may be subject to targeted attacks (e.g., as in network-based customer attrition analytics). Over the past few years, the increasing number of studies has indicated that GNNs are prone both to noisy node and noisy graph labels, and while this problem has received noticeable attention for node classification tasks, vulnerability of GNNs for graph classification with perturbed graph labels still remains in its nascence. We hypothesize that this challenge can be addressed by the universal principle United We Stand, Divided We Fall. In particular, most GNNs view each graph as a standalone entity and, as a result, are limited in their abilities to account for complex interdependencies among the graphs. Inspired by the recent studies on molecular graph learning, we propose a new robust knowledge representation called Networks to Graph (N2G). The key N2G idea is to construct a new abstraction where each graph in the collection is now represented by a node, while an edge then reflects some sort of similarity among the graphs. As a result, the graph classification task can be then naturally reformulated as a node classification problem. We show that the proposed N2G representation approach does not only improve classification performance both in binary and multi-class scenarios but also substantially enhances robustness against noisy labels in the training data, leading to relative robustness gains up to 11.7% on social network benchmarks and up to 25.8% on bioinformatics graph benchmarks under 10% of graph label corruption rate.

AB Guidance and control (G&C) technologies play a central role in the development and operation of vehicular systems. The emergence of computational guidance and control (CG&C) and highly efficient numerical algorithms has opened up the great potential for solving complex constrained G&C problems onboard, enabling higher level of autonomous vehicle operations. In particular, convex-optimization-based G&C has matured significantly over the years and many advances continue to be made, allowing the generation of optimal G&C solutions in real-time for many vehicular systems in aerospace, automotive, and other domains. In this paper, we review recent major advances in convex optimization and convexification techniques for G&C of vehicular systems, focusing primarily on three important application fields: (1) Space vehicles for powered descent guidance, small body landing, rendezvous and proximity operations, orbital transfer, spacecraft reorientation, space robotics and manipulation, spacecraft formation flying, and station keeping; (2) Air vehicles including hypersonic/entry vehicles, missiles and projectiles, launch/ascent vehicles, and low-speed air vehicles; and (3) Motion control and powertrain control of ground vehicles. Throughout the paper, we draw figures that illustrate the basic mission concepts and objectives, introduce key equations that characterize the feature of each class of problems and approaches, and present tables that summarize similarities and distinctions among the problems, ideas, and methods. Where available, we provide comparative analyses and reveal correlations between different applications and technical approaches. Finally, we identify open challenges and issues, discuss potential opportunities, and make suggestions for future research directions.

AB We present Basis-to-Basis (B2B) operator learning, a novel approach for learning operators on Hilbert spaces of functions based on the foundational ideas of function encoders. We decompose the task of learning operators into two parts: learning sets of basis functions for both the input and output spaces and learning a potentially nonlinear mapping between the coefficients of the basis functions. B2B operator learning circumvents many challenges of prior works, such as requiring data to be at fixed locations, by leveraging classic techniques such as least squares to compute the coefficients. It is especially potent for linear operators, where we compute a mapping between bases as a single matrix transformation with a closed-form solution. Furthermore, with minimal modifications and using the deep theoretical connections between function encoders and functional analysis, we derive operator learning algorithms that are directly analogous to eigen-decomposition and singular value decomposition. We empirically validate B2B operator learning on seven benchmark operator learning tasks and show that it demonstrates a two-orders-of-magnitude improvement in accuracy over existing approaches on several benchmark tasks.

AB Ferritin is a 24-mer protein nanocage that stores iron and regulates intracellular iron homeostasis. The nuclear receptor coactivator-4 (NCOA4) binds specifically to ferritin H subunits and facilitates the autophagic trafficking of ferritin to the lysosome for degradation and iron release. Using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), we studied the thermodynamics of the interactions between ferritin and the soluble fragment of NCOA4 (residues 383-522), focusing on the effects of the recently identified Fe-S cluster bound to NCOA4, ferritin subunit composition, and ferritin-iron loading. Our findings show that in the presence of the Fe-S cluster, the binding is driven by a more favorable enthalpy change and a decrease in entropy change, indicating a key role for the Fe-S cluster in the structural organization and stability of the complex. The ferritin iron core further enhances this association, increasing binding enthalpy and stabilizing the NCOA4-ferritin complex. The ferritin subunit composition primarily affects binding stoichiometry of the reaction based on the number of H subunits in the ferritin H/L oligomer. Our results demonstrate that both the Fe-S cluster and the ferritin iron core significantly affect the binding thermodynamics of the NCOA4-ferritin interactions, suggesting regulatory roles for the Fe-S cluster and ferritin iron content in ferritinophagy.

AB This report is on magneto-electric (ME) interactions in bulk composites with coaxial fibers of nickel-zinc ferrite and PZT. The core-shell fibers of PZT and Ni1-xZnxFe2O4 (NZFO) with x = 0-0.5 were made by electrospinning. Both kinds of fibers, either with ferrite or PZT core and with diameters in the range of 1-3 mu m were made. Electron and scanning probe microscopy images indicated well-formed fibers with uniform core and shell structures and defect-free interface. X-ray diffraction data for the fibers annealed at 700-900 degrees C did not show any impurity phases. Magnetization, magnetostriction, ferromagnetic resonance, and polarization P versus electric field E measurements confirmed the ferroic nature of the fibers. For ME measurements, the fibers were pressed into disks and rectangular platelets and then annealed at 900-1000 degrees C for densification. The strengths of strain-mediated ME coupling were measured by the H-induced changes in remnant polarization Pr and by low-frequency ME voltage coefficient (MEVC). The fractional change in Pr under H increased in magnitude, from +3% for disks of NFO-PZT to -82% for NZFO (x = 0.3)-PZT, and a further increase in x resulted in a decrease to a value of -3% for x = 0.5. The low-frequency MEVC measured in disks of the core-shell fibers ranged from 6 mV/cm Oe to 37 mV/cm Oe. The fractional changes in Pr and the MEVC values were an order of magnitude higher than for bulk samples containing mixed fibers with a random distribution of NZFO and PZT.

ID REPRESENTATION
AB Cohort studies are of significant fi cant importance in the fi eld of healthcare analytics. However, existing methods typically involve manual, labor-intensive, and expert-driven pattern definitions fi nitions or rely on simplistic clustering techniques that lack medical relevance. Automating cohort studies with interpretable patterns has great potential to facilitate healthcare analytics and data management but remains an unmet need in prior research efforts. ff orts. In this paper, we present a cohort auto-discovery framework for interpretable healthcare analytics. It focuses on the effective ff ective identification, fi cation, representation, and exploitation of cohorts characterized by medically meaningful patterns. In the framework, we propose CohortNet, a core model that can learn fi ne-grained patient representations by separately processing each feature, considering both individual feature trends and feature interactions at each time step. Subsequently, it employs K-Means in an adaptive manner to classify each feature into distinct states and a heuristic cohort exploration strategy to effectively ff ectively discover substantial cohorts with concrete patterns. For each identified fi ed cohort, it learns comprehensive cohort representations with credible evidence through associated patient retrieval. Ultimately, given a new patient, CohortNet can leverage relevant cohorts with distinguished importance which can provide a more holistic understanding of the patient's conditions. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, resulting in improvements in AUC-PR scores ranging from 2.8% to 4.1%, and offers ff ers interpretable insights from diverse perspectives in a top-down fashion.

AB Applying machine learning to clinical outcome prediction is challenging due to imbalanced datasets and sensitive tasks that contain rare yet critical outcomes and where equitable treatment across diverse patient groups is essential. Despite attempts, biases in predictions persist, driven by disparities in representation and exacerbated by the scarcity of positive labels, perpetuating health inequities. This paper introduces FairPlay, a synthetic data generation approach leveraging large language models, to address these issues. FairPlay enhances algorithmic performance and reduces bias by creating realistic, anonymous synthetic patient data that improves representation and augments dataset patterns while preserving privacy. Through experiments on multiple datasets, we demonstrate that FairPlay boosts mortality prediction performance across diverse subgroups, achieving up to a 21% improvement in F1 Score without requiring additional data or altering downstream training pipelines. Furthermore, FairPlay consistently reduces subgroup performance gaps, as shown by universal improvements in performance and fairness metrics across four experimental setups.

DE Candida auris; Wastewater; qPCR; Baltimore
AB Candida auris (C. auris), an opportunistic fungus causing disease, poses a growing global health concern due to its significant mortality rate, resistance to antifungal treatment, and ability to persist in healthcare settings. Over a span of 47 weeks, untreated wastewater samples were regularly gathered from two wastewater treatment plants (referred to as WWTP-A and WWTP-B) in Baltimore, from July 27, 2022, to June 23, 2023. Throughout the study period, 110 primary influent (PI) samples were collected from both WWTP-A and WWTP-B. A quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) method was used to analyze C. auris captured on filters (0.45 mu m) from these samples. Positive C. auris detection (11.81%) occurred in the influent samples, with a higher frequency of detection in WWTP-B. Influent wastewater concentrations ranged from 1.2 to 7.9 log10 gene copies per liter (gc/ L). Interestingly, seasonal analysis showed that C. auris presence in wastewater was more pronounced during the spring season, indicating a sustained existence of the pathogen as seasons changed. Integration of wastewater surveillance and clinical data reveals temporal correlations in C. auris dynamics. The resulting Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.27 reveals a weak positive correlation between the number of new C. auris cases in Baltimore and the quantity of detected gene copies in wastewater. This study marks the first instance of detecting C. auris in Baltimore's wastewater. The results emphasize that wastewater monitoring could serve as an additional early warning tool for anticipating and managing future outbreaks of C. auris.

AB Despite the importance of CO adsorption in many electrocatalytic reaction mechanisms, there has been little investigation of the dependence of the free energy of CO adsorption on the applied potential. Herein, we report on the potential-dependent adsorption of CO on Cu electrodes using a grand-canonical density functional theory approach. We demonstrate that, within the working potential range of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction on Cu(111) and Cu(100), the CO adsorption strength can change by over 0.1 eV. Our analyses explain the potential dependence through an interfacial capacitance loss upon CO adsorption as well as orbital relaxation induced by the electrode potential. Via sensitivity analysis with respect to two electrolyte model parameters (solvent dielectric constant and Debye screening length), we find that the surface excess charge density is a useful descriptor of the CO adsorption free energy.

TI Peierls-like distortion drives anion ordering in rutile TiOF

DT Article
ID INSULATOR-TRANSITION; PHASE-TRANSITION; METAL
AB Using first principles density functional theory calculations, we explore the atomic and electronic structure of TiOF, aiming to understand the impact of fluoride substitution on the rutile TiO2 framework. We identify the ground state atomic structure of TiOF and uncover the driving forces behind the experimentally observed anion ordering along rutile (110) planes. The anion ordering stems from the interplay between Ti-F cation-anion interactions and the tendency of d(1) Ti3+ cations to form singlet Ti-Ti dimers through enhanced metal-metal bonding. As the on-site Coulombic interactions increase, we observe suppression of the singlet state formation and the induction of local magnetic moments on the Ti3+ sites. Lastly, we show that the d-electron filling of the transition metal cation dictates the long-range anion ordering in 3d rutile oxyfluorides.

AB Industrial robots have become an important aspect in modern industry. In the context of human-robot collaboration, enabling teleoperated robots to work in close proximity to local/onsite humans can provide new opportunities to improve human engagement in a distributed workplace. Interviews with industry stakeholders highlighted several potential benefits of such teleoperator-robot-human collaboration (tRHC), including the application of tRHC to tasks requiring both expertise and manual dexterity (e.g., maintenance and highly skilled tasks in sectors including construction, manufacturing, and healthcare), as well as opportunities to expand job accessibility for individuals with disabilities and older individuals. However, interviewees also indicated potential challenges of tRHC, particularly related to human perception (e.g., perceiving remote environments), safety, and trust. Given these challenges, and the current limited information on the practical value and implementation of tRHC, we propose several future research directions, with a focus on human factors and ergonomics, to help realize the potential benefits of tRHC.
   BackgroundThe increasing prevalence of robots in industrial environments is attributed in part to advancements in collaborative robot technologies, enabling robots to work in close proximity to humans. Simultaneously, the rise of teleoperation, involving remote robot control, poses unique opportunities and challenges for human-robot collaboration (HRC) in diverse and distributed workspaces.PurposeThere is not yet a comprehensive understanding of HRC in teleoperation, specifically focusing on collaborations involving the teleoperator, the robot, and the local or onsite workers in industrial settings, here referred to as teleoperator-robot-human collaboration (tRHC). We aimed to identify opportunities, challenges, and potential applications of tRHC through insights provided from industry stakeholders, thereby supporting effective future industrial implementations.MethodsThirteen stakeholders in robotics, specializing in different domains (i.e., safety, robot manufacturing, aerospace/automotive manufacturing, and supply chains), completed semi-structured interviews that focused on exploring diverse aspects relevant to tRHC. The interviews were then transcribed and thematic analysis was applied to group responses into broader categories, which were further compared across stakeholder industries.ResultsWe identified three main categories and 13 themes from the interviews. These categories include Benefits, Concerns, and Technical Challenges. Interviewees highlighted accessibility, ergonomics, flexibility, safety, time & cost saving, and trust as benefits of tRHC. Concerns raised encompassed safety, standards, trust, and workplace optimization. Technical challenges consisted of critical issues such as communication time delays, the need for high dexterity in robot manipulators, the importance of establishing shared situational awareness among all agents, and the potential of augmented and virtual reality in providing immersive control interfaces.ConclusionsDespite important challenges, tRHC could offer unique benefits, facilitating seamless collaboration among the teleoperator, teleoperated robot(s), and onsite workers across physical and geographic boundaries. To realize such benefits and address the challenges, we propose several research directions to further explore and develop tRHC capabilities.

AB Tabular data (or tables) are the most widely used data format in machine learning (ML). However, ML models often assume the table structure keeps fixed in training and testing. Before ML modeling, heavy data cleaning is required to merge disparate tables with different columns. This preprocessing often incurs significant data waste (e.g., removing unmatched columns and samples). How to learn ML models from multiple tables with partially overlapping columns? How to incrementally update ML models as more columns become available over time? Can we leverage model pretraining on multiple distinct tables? How to train an ML model which can predict on an unseen table?
   To answer all those questions, we propose to relax fixed table structures by introducing a Transferable Tabular Transformer (TransTab) for tables. The goal of TransTab is to convert each sample (a row in the table) to a generalizable embedding vector, and then apply stacked transformers for feature encoding. One methodology insight is combining column description and table cells as the raw input to a gated transformer model. The other insight is to introduce supervised and self-supervised pretraining to improve model performance. We compare TransTab with multiple baseline methods on diverse benchmark datasets and five oncology clinical trial datasets. Overall, TransTab ranks 1.00, 1.00, 1.78 out of 12 methods in supervised learning, feature incremental learning, and transfer learning scenarios, respectively; and the proposed pretraining leads to 2.3% AUC lift on average over the supervised learning.

AB We present a data-driven investigation leveraging high-throughput density functional theory calculations and machine learning to expedite the discovery of van der Waals (vdW) materials with nonlinear optical properties. Using the Computational 2D Materials Database, we analyze data from 345 noncentrosymmetric, nonmagnetic semiconductor monolayers, focusing on their second-order susceptibility tensors across multiple energy ranges suitable for various laser applications. By applying data mining techniques to extract key features from second harmonic generation spectra and employing machine learning models, we predict the second-order optical susceptibility for these materials. Our framework for this work facilitates the rapid identification of vdW materials for advanced photonics, optoelectronics, and data storage applications.

AB PIXE analysis was conducted on p8 fisher brand filter paper samples soaked in elemental standard solutions to determine the minimum detectable levels of Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Cr, Fe, Ni, Cu, and Se. All samples were analyzed with beam parameters of 2 mu C incident charge, and beam current of less than 2 nA at 2 MeV beam energy. Minimum detectable levels were obtained by analyzing the x-ray spectrum in the GeoPIXE analysis package, and the data for each element would be averaged over all collected spectra. The minimum detectable level in parts per million was found to be on average 9.59 for Al, 4.6 for Si, 3.23 for P, 2.27 for S, 1.82 for Cl, 1.15 for K, 0.88 for Ca, 0.51 for Cr, 0.07 for Mn, 0.54 for Fe, 1.59 for Ni, 2.0 for Zn, 1.55 for Cu, and 6.5 for Se. Minimal deviation from the averaged values was observed, except in cases where samples contained high concentrations of elements with overlapping X-ray energies.

AB Multi-photon polymerization is a well-established, yet actively developing, additive manufacturing technique for 3D printing on the micro/nanoscale. Like all additive manufacturing techniques, determining the process parameters necessary to achieve dimensional accuracy for a structure 3D printed using this method is not always straightforward and can require time-consuming experimentation. In this work, an active machine learning based framework is presented for determining optimal process parameters for the recently developed, high-speed, layer-by-layer continuous projection 3D printing process. The proposed active learning framework uses Bayesian optimization to inform optimal experimentation in order to adaptively collect the most informative data for effective training of a Gaussian-process-regression-based machine learning model. This model then serves as a surrogate for the manufacturing process: predicting optimal process parameters for achieving a target geometry, e.g., the 2D geometry of each printed layer. Three representative 2D shapes at three different scales are used as test cases. In each case, the active learning framework improves the geometric accuracy, with drastic reductions of the errors to within the measurement accuracy in just four iterations of the Bayesian optimization using only a few hundred of total training data. The case studies indicate that the active learning framework developed in this work can be broadly applied to other additive manufacturing processes to increase accuracy with significantly reduced experimental data collection effort for optimization.

ID CORONAL MASS EJECTIONS; SPACE WEATHER; ARRIVAL; MODEL; EARTH
AB The application of machine learning to the study of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and their impacts on Earth has seen significant growth recently. Understanding and forecasting CME geoeffectiveness are crucial for protecting infrastructure in space and ensuring the resilience of technological systems on Earth. Here we present GeoCME, a deep-learning framework designed to predict, deterministically or probabilistically, whether a CME event that arrives at Earth will cause a geomagnetic storm. A geomagnetic storm is defined as a disturbance of the Earth's magnetosphere during which the minimum Dst index value is less than -50 nT. GeoCME is trained on observations from the instruments including LASCO C2, EIT, and MDI on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), focusing on a dataset that includes 136 halo/partial halo CMEs in Solar Cycle 23. Using ensemble and transfer learning techniques, GeoCME is capable of extracting features hidden in the SOHO observations and making predictions based on the learned features. Our experimental results demonstrate the good performance of GeoCME, achieving a Matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.807 and a true skill statistics score of 0.714 when the tool is used as a deterministic prediction model. When the tool is used as a probabilistic forecasting model, it achieves a Brier score of 0.094 and a Brier skill score of 0.493. These results are promising, showing that the proposed GeoCME can help enhance our understanding of CME-triggered solar-terrestrial interactions.

AB Rotational closures have potential fisheries benefits, yet their impact on coral cover is unknown. Research has shown that permanent closures can protect herbivorous fish, indirectly benefiting corals, but these observations may not apply when closed periods alternate with fishing. Here, we examine how rotational closures affect coral, focusing on systems with the potential to switch between alternative stable states, a context in which temporary closures may have persistent effects. We show that rotational closures can trigger coral recovery, and in some contexts lead to better coral recovery than fixed closures of similar size. Such benthic effects are only possible if closures last long enough for change to occur. We also note that very large fixed or rotating closures may concentrate fishing effort in areas where fishing remains permitted, leading to lower overall coral cover. Our findings offer crucial guidance to managers regarding rotational closures' potential advantages and drawbacks.

AB This study aimed to develop a novel framework to quickly personalize electromyography (EMG)-driven musculoskeletal models (MMs) as efferent neural interfaces for upper limb prostheses. Our framework adopts a generic upper-limb MM as a baseline and uses an artificial neural network-based policy to fine-tune the model parameters for MM personalization. The policy was trained by reinforcement learning (RL) to heuristically adjust the MM parameters to maximize the accuracy of estimated hand and wrist motions from EMG inputs. Our present framework was compared to the baseline MM and a widely used MM parameter optimization method: simulated annealing (SA). An offline evaluation was performed to first quantify the time required for MM personalization and the kinematics estimation accuracy of personalized MMs based on data collected from non-disabled subjects. Then, in an online evaluation, additional human subjects, including an individual with a transradial amputation, performed a virtual hand posture matching task using generic and personalized MMs. Results showed that compared to the baseline generic MM, personalized MMs estimated joint motion with lower error in both offline ( p<0.05 ) and online tests ( p=0.014 ), demonstrating the benefit of MM personalization. The RL-based framework performed model optimization in under one second on average in cases that took SA over 13 minutes and yielded comparable kinematics estimations both offline and online. Hence, our present personalization framework can be a practical solution for the daily use of EMG-driven MMs in prostheses or other assistive devices.

DE Side-channel analysis; deep learning
AB Deep learning side-channel attacks can recover encryption keys on a target by analyzing power consumption or electromagnetic (EM) signals. However, they are less portable when there are domain shifts between training and test data. While existing studies have shown that pre-processing and unsupervised domain adaptation can enhance the portability of deep learning side-channel attacks given domain shifts over EM traces, the findings are limited to easy targets (e.g. 8-bit microcontrollers).
   In this paper, we investigate the portability of deep learning side-channel attacks over EM traces acquired from more challenging targets, including 32-bit microcontrollers and EM traces with random delay. We study domain shifts introduced by the combination of hardware variations, distinct keys, and inconsistent probe locations between two targets. In addition, we perform comparative analyses of multiple existing (and new) pre-processing and unsupervised domain adaptation methods. We conduct a series of comprehensive experiments and derive three main observations. (1) Pre-processing and unsupervised domain adaptation methods can enhance the portability of deep learning side-channel attacks over more challenging targets. (2) The effectiveness of each method, however, varies depending on the target and probe locations in use. In other words, observations of a method on easy targets do not necessarily generalize to challenging targets. (3) None of the methods can constantly outperform others. Moreover, we highlight two types of pitfalls that could lead to over-optimistic attack results in cross-device evaluations. We also contribute a large-scale public dataset (with 3 million EM traces from 9 probe locations over multiple targets) for benchmarking and reproducibility of side-channel attacks tackling domain shifts over EM traces.

AB Multiferroic materials capable of robust magnetoelectric coupling at room temperature are currently being explored for their possible multifunctional device applications. Highly (100)-oriented Pb(Fe0.5Ta0.5)(x)(Zr0.53Ti0.47)(1-x) (PZTFT(x)) thin films (x = 0.2 and 0.3) with a thickness of about 300 nm were grown on La0.67Sr0.33CoO3 (LSCO)-buffered MgO 100-oriented substrates via the pulsed laser deposition method. An analysis of their X-ray diffraction patterns suggests the stabilization of the orthorhombic phase in the thin films at room temperature. Dielectric spectroscopic measurements of the metal-insulator-metal (Pt/PZTFT(x)/LSCO) thin-film capacitors as a function of temperature revealed a diffuse ferroelectric-to-paraelectric phase transition around Tm similar to 520 and 560 K for the x = 0.2 and 0.3 thin films, respectively. Well-saturated electrical hysteresis loops with large remanent (Pr) and saturation (Ps) polarizations were observed in these capacitors, which indicates the establishment of intrinsic ferroelectric ordering in the thin films at room temperature. These thin films retained ferromagnetic/ferrimagnetic ordering up to 300 K and showed saturation magnetization values of 8.3 (x = 0.2) and 6.1 (x = 0.3) emu/cm(3) at room temperature. The magnetoelectric coupling constants of 2040 mV/cmOe (x = 0.2) and 850 mV/cmOe (x = 0.3), respectively, were obtained at an in-plane bias field at room temperature. The present study demonstrates that PZTFT(x) thin films are multiferroic at room temperature with large magnetoelectric couplings, and these materials may be suitable for use in magnetic sensors and spintronic device applications.

AB We introduce a novel meta-analysis framework to combine dependent tests under a general setting, and utilize it to synthesize various microbiome association tests that are calculated from the same dataset. Our development builds upon the classical meta-analysis methods of aggregating P-values and also a more recent general method of combining confidence distributions, but makes generalizations to handle dependent tests. The proposed framework ensures rigorous statistical guarantees, and we provide a comprehensive study and compare it with various existing dependent combination methods. Notably, we demonstrate that the widely used Cauchy combination method for dependent tests, referred to as the vanilla Cauchy combination in this article, can be viewed as a special case within our framework. Moreover, the proposed framework provides a way to address the problem when the distributional assumptions underlying the vanilla Cauchy combination are violated. Our numerical results demonstrate that ignoring the dependence among the to-be-combined components may lead to a severe size distortion phenomenon. Compared to the existing P-value combination methods, including the vanilla Cauchy combination method and other methods, the proposed combination framework is flexible and can be adapted to handle the dependence accurately and utilizes the information efficiently to construct tests with accurate size and enhanced power. The development is applied to the microbiome association studies, where we aggregate information from multiple existing tests using the same dataset. The combined tests harness the strengths of each individual test across a wide range of alternative spaces, enabling more efficient and meaningful discoveries of vital microbiome associations.

ID VEHICLE-ROUTING PROBLEM; CUT-AND-PRICE; TRAVELING SALESMAN PROBLEM;

AB In this paper, we propose an innovative variable fixing strategy called deep Lagrangian underestimate fi xing (DeLuxing). It is a highly effective approach for removing unnecessary variables in column-generation (CG)-based exact methods used to solve challenging discrete optimization problems commonly encountered in various industries, including vehicle routing problems (VRPs). DeLuxing employs a novel linear programming (LP) formulation with only a small subset of the enumerated variables, which is theoretically guaranteed to yield qualified dual solutions for computing Lagrangian underestimates (LUs). Because of their small sizes, DeLuxing can efficiently solve a sequence of similar LPs to generate multiple high-quality LUs, and thus can, in most cases, remove over 75% of the variables from the enumerated pool. We extend the fundamental concept underpinning the new formulation to contexts beyond variable fixing, namely, variable type relaxation and cutting plane addition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in accelerating CG-based exact methods via the capacitated multitrip vehicle routing problem with time windows (CMTVRPTW), its two important variants with loading times or release dates, and the classic capacitated VRP (CVRP) and VRPTW. Enhanced by DeLuxing and the extensions, one of the best exact methods for solving the CMTVRPTW doubles the size of instances solved optimally for the first time while being more than 7 times on average and up to over 20 times as fast as top-performing exact methods reported in the literature. It further accelerates RouteOpt, one of the world's fastest VRP solvers, by 45% and 71%, respectively, for solving the 200-node CVRP and 300-node VRPTW instances. Although DeLuxing is less effective for longer routes, it still contributes to an effective primal heuristic.

AB This work demonstrates the synthesis and characterization of Fe nanoparticles surrounded by a citrate (CIT) matrix prepared at various temperatures and concentrations of metal, capping agent and reducing agent at standard conditions. We study the effect of reactant ratio and reaction temperature on the magnetization of the produced nanoparticles and their crystal structure. We found that for optimal metal concentrations, magnetic saturation increases with increase in the concentration of capping and reducing agents but decreases as the temperature of the reaction increases. Synthesis conditions were tailored to reveal nucleation of particles with average sizes ranging from 24 to 105 nm and a spherical shape. The ultra-high saturation magnetization of 228 emu g-1 obtained for samples prepared at a metal precursor concentration of 27.8 mol l-1 was attributed to the formation of small magnetic domains. Energy band gap measurements revealed a band gap energy for the Fe nanoparticles in the CIT matrix which is associated with CIT concentration and/or possible formation of a few thin layers of iron oxide shell and does not have a significant effect on the magnetic properties of the samples. Herein, we demonstrate that the synthesis parameters are crucial for the nucleation of Fe-CIT nanoparticles tailoring their magnetizatic properties as well as their potential for different applications.

AB Bursty star formation-a key prediction for high-redshift galaxies from cosmological simulations explicitly resolving stellar feedback in the interstellar medium-has recently been observed to prevail among galaxies at redshift z greater than or similar to 6. Line intensity mapping (LIM) of the 158 mu m [C ii] line as a star formation rate (SFR) indicator offers unique opportunities to tomographically constrain cosmic star formation at high redshift, in a way complementary to observations of individually detected galaxies. To understand the effects of bursty star formation on [C ii] LIM, which have remained unexplored in previous studies, we present an analytic modeling framework for high-z galaxy formation and [C ii] LIM signals that accounts for bursty star formation histories induced by delayed supernova feedback. We use it to explore and characterize how bursty star formation can impact and thus complicate the interpretation of the [C ii] luminosity function and power spectrum. Our simple analytic model indicates that bursty star formation mainly affects low-mass galaxies by boosting their average SFR and [C ii] luminosity, and in the [C ii] power spectrum it can create a substantial excess in the large-scale clustering term. This distortion results in a power spectrum shape that cannot be explained by invoking a mass-independent logarithmic scatter. We conclude that burstiness must be accounted for when modeling and analyzing [C ii] data sets from the early Universe, and that in the extreme, the signature of burstiness may be detectable with first-generation experiments such as TIME, CONCERTO, and CCAT-DSS.

AB When learning multiple tasks in a sequence, deep neural networks tend to loose accuracy on tasks learned in the past while gaining accuracy on the current task. This phenomenon is called catastrophic forgetting. Memory-based Class Incremental Learning (CIL) methods address this problem by re-learning exemplars retained in the memory from previous tasks. However, due to data imbalances between the training data for the current task and the limited exemplars from previous tasks, existing methods struggle to balance the accuracy across all seen tasks. Here, we propose to address data imbalance and in addition to a generic model to learn a set of task-specific parameters. In particular, we propose a novel methodology of Tangent Kernel for Incremental Learning (TKIL) that seeks an equilibrium between current and previous representations. Specifically, TKIL achieves such equilibrium by tuning different task-specific parameters for different tasks with a new Gradient Tangent Kernel (GTK) loss. Therefore, when representing previous tasks, task-specific models are not impacted by the samples of the current task and are able to retain learned representations. As a result, TKIL equally considers the contribution from all task models. The generalized parameters that TKIL obtains allow it to automatically identify which task is being considered and to adapt to it during inference. Extensive experiments on five CIL benchmark datasets with ten incremental learning settings show that TKIL outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, e.g., achieving 9.4% boost on CIFAR-100 with 25 incremental stages.

AB Gridded ion thrusters are tested in ground vacuum chambers to verify their performance when deployed in space. However, the presence of high background pressure and conductive walls in the chamber leads to facility effects that increase uncertainty in the performance of the thruster in space. To address this issue, this study utilizes a fully kinetic simulation to investigate the facility effects on the thruster plume. The in-chamber condition shows a downstream neutral particle density 100 times larger than the in-space case due to ion neutralization at the wall and limited vacuum pump capability, resulting in a significant difference in the density and distribution of charge-exchange ions. The flux, energy, and angle of charge-exchange ions incident on the chamber wall are found to be altered by the electron sheath, which can only be simulated by the fully kinetic approach, as opposed to the conventionally used quasi-neutral Boltzmann approach. We also examine the effect of back sputtering, another important facility effect, and find that it does not necessarily require a fully kinetic simulation as the incident flux and energy of the sampled charge-exchange ion are negligibly small. Finally, we demonstrate that the carbon deposition rate on the thruster is significantly influenced by the angular dependence of the sputtered carbon, with a nearly 50% effect.

AB Powder bed fusion (PBF) is an additive manufacturing process in which laser heat liquefies blown powder particles on top of a powder bed, and cooling solidifies the melted powder particles. During this process, the laser beam heat interacts with the powder causing thermal emission and affecting the melt pool. This paper aims to predict heat emission in PBF by harnessing the strengths of recurrent neural networks. Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are developed to learn from sequential data (emission readings), while the learning is guided by process physics including laser power, laser speed, layer number, and scanning patterns. To reduce the computational efforts on model training, the LSTM models are integrated with a new approach for down-sampling the pyrometry raw data and extracting useful statistical features from raw data. The structure and hyperparameters of the LSTM model reflect several iterations of tuning based on the training on the pyrometer readings data. Results reveal useful knowledge on how raw pyrometer data should be processed to work the best with LSTM, how physics features are informative in predicting overheating, and the effectiveness of physics-guided LSTM in emission prediction.

AB Long and stable timescales are often observed in complex biochemical networks, such as in emergent oscillations. How these robust dynamics persist remains unclear, given the many stochastic reactions and shorter time scales demonstrated by underlying components. We propose a topological model that produces long oscillations around the network boundary, reducing the system dynamics to a lower-dimensional current in a robust manner. Using this to model KaiC, which regulates the circadian rhythm in cyanobacteria, we compare the coherence of oscillations to that in other KaiC models. Our topological model localizes currents on the system edge, with an efficient regime of simultaneously increased precision and decreased cost. Further, we introduce a new predictor of coherence from the analysis of spectral gaps, and show that our model saturates a global thermodynamic bound. Our work presents a new mechanism and parsimonious description for robust emergent oscillations in complex biological networks.
   Complex biological systems, often stochastic and heterogenous, can undergo dimensionality reduction, however processes governing this transition are not well understood. The authors propose a topological model that produces long oscillations in biological networks, reducing the system dynamics to a lower-dimensional current.

AB Electron doping induces metal -to -insulator transition (MIT) in SmNiO 3 as realized by experiments. While earlier density functional theory (DFT) studies with static correlations fell short of explaining the recent MIT observations at lower hydrogen concentrations, we present a comprehensive computational investigation employing an advanced approach. We combine DFT with dynamical mean field theory (DFT + DMFT) to efficiently analyze the insulating behavior of hydrogen -doped SmNiO 3 . In contrast to previous theoretical works, our calculations predict an insulator transition occurring at a reduced doping level of H:Ni = 0.5:1. Specifically, while the DFT + U method reveals a gap opening between p -to - d orbitals, the DMFT approach highlights a gap opening between d -to - d orbitals. Our findings uncover a selective Mott transition in site and orbital characteristics, with the Ni ions proximate to the doped hydrogen exhibiting Mott -like traits. Notably, DMFT calculations highlight a pronounced dependence on Hund's parameter J , implying the presence of Hundness in the Mott insulator. This study underscores the necessity of accounting for dynamical correlations to accurately describe the electronic structure of strongly correlated electron -doped rare-earth nickelates.

AB Axisymmetric numerical simulations are used to assess the swirl-induced stabilization of low-Mach -number non-premixed jet flames at a moderate Reynolds number (Re = 200). Using a one-step model chemistry describing methane-air partially premixed combustion, we carry out a parametric investigation of the coupling between vortex breakdown and laminar flame liftoff/blowoff in a concentric jet configuration involving a central non-swirling methane jet surrounded by a swirling annular air jet issuing from a pipe with radius R-A' rotating with angular speed Omega'. The analysis considers order-unity values of the two relevant controlling parameters, namely, the Damkohler number D-N, defined as the square of the ratio of the stoichiometric methane-air flame-propagation velocity to the mean air-jet velocity U-A', and the swirl number S = Omega'R-A'/U-A'. As the Damkohler number D-N is decreased the attached edge flame lifts off from the injector rim. The resulting lifted triple flame migrates downstream on further decreasing D-N until a critical blowoff value D-N,D-b is reached. Results for fixed S = 1 exhibit lower values D-N,D-b than the corresponding simulations with fixed S = 0 . For a fixed Damkohler number, it is found that increasing S results in increased entrainment and reduced liftoff heights. At a critical value S-B* of the swirl number, equal to S-B* = 1 . 2 for D-N = 0 . 35 , a recirculation zone abruptly forms upstream of the lifted triple flame, enhancing the mixing and facilitating flame stabilization closer to the injector.

AB The Unlearning Racism in Geosciences (URGE) program guides groups of geoscientists as they draft, implement, and assess anti-racist policies and resources for their workplace. Some participating Geoscientists of Color (GoC) shared concerns about microaggression, tokenism, and power struggles within their groups. These reports led us to collect and analyze data that describe the experiences of GoC in URGE. The data are from five discussion groups and two surveys. Our analyses revealed that participating GoC want to continue working with White colleagues on anti-racist work. GoC want White colleagues not to shy away from doing anti-racist work. Instead, GoC want White colleagues (a) to create and adhere to robust behavioral codes of conduct, (b) to focus discussions on anti-racism, (c) to act on anti-racism initiatives, (d) not to prompt GoC to educate them or reveal trauma, and (e) to refrain from microaggressions and tokenism. These desired outcomes were achieved in some groups with varying degrees of success. Correcting a history of mistrust relating to racism and anti-racism action is key to implementing and assessing effective anti-racist policies and resources. This requires leadership support, following through on anti-racism action, and deepening relationships between GoC and White colleagues. Future anti-racist programs should spend a substantial amount of time on and demonstrate the importance of training participants how to discuss racism effectively and how to create and adhere to robust behavioral codes of conduct. Future programs should also explore developing a robust program-wide code of conduct that includes a policy for reporting offenses.

AB Two-party computation (2PC) is promising to enable privacy-preserving deep learning (DL). However, the 2PC-based privacy-preserving DL implementation comes with high comparison protocol overhead from the non-linear operators. This work presents PASNet, a novel systematic framework that enables low latency, high energy efficiency & accuracy, and security-guaranteed 2PC-DL by integrating the hardware latency of the cryptographic building block into the neural architecture search loss function. We develop a cryptographic hardware scheduler and the corresponding performance model for Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) as a case study. The experimental results demonstrate that our light-weighted model PASNet-A and heavily-weighted model PASNet-B achieve 63 ms and 228 ms latency on private inference on ImageNet, which are 147 and 40 times faster than the SOTA CryptGPU system, and achieve 70.54% & 78.79% accuracy and more than 1000 times higher energy efficiency. The pretrained PASNet models and test code can be found on Github(1).

AB The multiple-try Metropolis (MTM) algorithm is an extension of the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm by selecting the proposed state among multiple trials according to some weight function. Although MTM has gained great popularity owing to its faster empirical convergence and mixing than the standard MH algorithm, its theoretical mixing property is rarely studied in the literature due to its complex proposal scheme. We prove that MTM can achieve a mixing time bound smaller than that of MH by a factor of the number of trials under a general setting applicable to high-dimensional model selection problems with discrete state spaces. Our theoretical results motivate a new class of weight functions called locally balanced weight functions and guide the choice of the number of trials, which leads to improved performance over standard MTM algorithms. We support our theoretical results by extensive simulation studies and real data applications with several Bayesian model selection problems.

AB In this paper, we show how to construct XX Hamiltonians that realize perfect quantum state transfer and also have the property that the overlap of the time evolved state with the initial state is zero for some time before the transfer time. If the latter takes place, we call it an early exclusion state. We also show that in some cases, early state exclusion is impossible. The proofs rely on properties of Krawtchouk and Chebyshev polynomials.

AB Today's data-driven world requires earth and environmental scientists to have skills at the intersection of domain and data science. These skills are imperative to harness information contained in a growing volume of complex data to solve the world's most pressing environmental challenges. Despite the importance of these skills, Earth and Environmental Data Science (EDS) training is not equally accessible, contributing to a lack of diversity in the field. This creates a critical need for EDS training opportunities designed specifically for underrepresented groups. In response, we developed the Earth Data Science Corps (EDSC) which couples a paid internship for undergraduate students with faculty training to build capacity to teach and learn EDS using Python at smaller Minority Serving Institutions. EDSC faculty participants are further empowered to teach these skills at their home institutions which scales the program beyond the training lead by our team. Using a Rasch modeling approach, we found that participating in the EDSC program had a significant impact on undergraduate learners' comfort and confidence with technical and nontechnical data science skills, as well as their science identity and sense of belonging in science, two critical aspects of recruiting and retaining members of underrepresented groups in STEM.

AB Continual learning (CL) focuses on training machine learning models to incrementally learn new tasks while avoiding "catastrophic forgetting" of previous tasks. CL is analogous to human learning and effective computational techniques are being actively researched. This paper introduces a novel approach to CL in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using tensor rank increments, which facilitates learning new tasks without forgetting previous ones. For each new task, our method intelligently reuses parameters trained for previous tasks, augmented with a small number of new parameters, thereby achieving efficient learning. Our experimental studies demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared to existing alternatives across multiple standard datasets.

AB Thin films of rare-earth monopnictide (RE-V) semimetals are expected to turn into semiconductors due to quantum confinement effects (QCE), lifting the overlap between electron pockets at Brillouin zone edges (X) and hole pockets at the zone center (Gamma). Instead, using LaSb as an example, we find the emergence of the quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulator phase in (001)-oriented films as the thickness is reduced to 7, 5, or 3 monolayers (MLs). This is attributed to a strong QCE on the in-plane electron pockets and the lack of quantum confinement on the out-of-plane pocket projected onto the zone center, resulting in a band inversion. Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) opens a sizable nontrivial gap in the band structure of ultrathin films. Such effect is anticipated to be general in rare-earth monopnictides and may lead to interesting phenomena when coupled with the 4f magnetic moments present in other members of this family of materials.

AB Developing protocols for designing high-efficiency, durable, cost-effective electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) necessitates deeper understanding of structure-property correlation as a function of composition. Herein, it has been demonstrated that incorporating tellurium into binary nickel chalcogenide (NiSe) and creating a mixed anionic phase perturbs its electronic structure and significantly enhances the OER activity. A series of nanostructured nickel chalcogenides comprising a layer-by-layer morphology along with mixed anionic ternary phase are grown in situ on nickel foam with varying morphological textures using simple hydrothermal synthesis route. Comprehensive X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and in situ Raman spectroscopy analysis confirms the formation of a trigonal single-phase nanocrystalline nickel (telluro)-selenide (NiSeTe) as a truly mixed anionic composition. The NiSeTe electrocatalyst exhibits excellent OER performance, with a low overpotential of 300 mV at 50 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 98 mV dec(-1) in 1 m KOH electrolyte. The turnover frequency and mass activity are 0.047 s(-1) and 90.3 Ag-1, respectively. Detailed electrochemical measurements also reveal enhanced charge transfer properties of the NiSeTe phase compared to the mixture of binaries. Density functional theory calculations reveal favorable OH adsorption energy in the mixed anionic phase compared to the binary chalcogenides confirming superior electrocatalytic property.

TI Combining Socioeconomic, Demographic, and Zoning Data to Explore Urban
   Inequality in Pittsburgh

ID SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; LAND-USE; ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE; FACILITIES
AB Historic injustices due to racial discrimination, redlining, and inequitable zoning practices have contributed to urban inequalities in the United States. These inequalities have been compounded by a lack of consideration for how infrastructure, industrial projects, and zoning impact nearby low-income and minority populations. To promote an equitable future, this paper investigates whether there are spatial patterns based on zoning variance data in the city of Pittsburgh. The authors used principal component analysis and regression analysis to study statistical correlations between socioeconomic and demographic characteristics and zoning variance application data. Several relationships reflect statistical significance, such as the average income of the residents and the percentage over the age of 25 who are college-educated, while the overall results highlight potential future research areas. Our work combining data sets with spatially explicit statistical analysis has the potential to equip decision makers with future tools necessary to account for inequalities and assess communities that may be unaware of the opportunities that variances present.

TI First-principles study of proton migration in indium oxide
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
LA English
DT Article
ID TRANSPARENT; HYDROGEN; DEFECTS; IN2O3; FILMS
AB Indium oxide is widely used as a transparent conducting oxide. Interstitial hydrogen (Hi) acts as a shallow donor, but is expected to be quite mobile, thus enabling potential applications in electrochemical synapses or electrochemical random-access memory. Understanding the diffusion of interstitial hydrogen is essential for controlling its incorporation and stability. Using first-principles calculations based on hybrid density functional theory we find that the proton is the most stable charge state for Fermi levels up to 0.77 eV above the conduction-band minimum. Based on the nudged elastic band method we find that local hopping of the H atom, corresponding to a realignment of the O-H bond, can occur with an activation energy of 0.24 eV; this process can thus occur at low temperatures but does not lead to long-range diffusion. The long-range migration path of H+i can be decomposed into rotations of the hydrogen atom around oxygen atoms and jumps between two oxygen atoms, with an overall activation energy of 0.94 eV. We compare our results with recent experiments, finding excellent agreement in both the low-temperature and high-temperature regimes, but leading to a re-evaluation of the measured activation energy. Our results provide insight into the different physical mechanisms that govern hydrogen motion in the different temperature regimes, and highlight the necessity of including the quantum-mechanical behavior of protons at low temperature.

TI Two-component repulsive atomic Fermi gases in a thin spherical shell
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
LA English
DT Article
ID EINSTEIN; VORTICES
AB We present possible ground-state structures of two-component atomic Fermi gases with repulsive interactions in a thin spherical shell geometry by implementing a self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation. The system exhibits a miscible-immiscible transition from a homogeneous mixture to two-chunk phase separation as the interaction strength crosses a critical value. While the critical value is relatively insensitive to population imbalance for equal-mass mixtures, it decreases with the mass ratio when mass imbalance is present. The interaction may be tuned by the two-body scattering length or the radius of the sphere, thereby allowing the system to cross the transition by varying different parameters. When the atoms on the sphere are rotating, three-chunk sandwich structures emerge in mass-imbalanced mixtures as a consequence of maximal angular momentum along the rotation axis. Some indications of geometric effects and possible experimental implications are also discussed.

AB Risk assessment of infrastructure exposed to ice-rich permafrost hazards is essential for climate change adaptation in the Arctic. As this process requires up-to-date, comprehensive, high-resolution maps of human-built infrastructure, gaps in such geospatial information and knowledge of the applications required to produce it must be addressed. Therefore, this study highlights the ongoing development of a deep learning approach to efficiently map the Arctic built environment by detecting nine different types of structures (detached houses, row houses, multi-story blocks, non-residential buildings, roads, runways, gravel pads, pipelines, and storage tanks) from recently-acquired Maxar commercial satellite imagery (<1 m resolution). We conducted a multi-objective comparison, focusing on generalization performance and computational cost, of nine different semantic segmentation architectures. K-fold cross validation was used to estimate the average F1-score of each architecture and the Friedman Aligned Ranks test with the Bergmann-Hommel post-hoc procedure was applied to test for significant differences in generalization performance. ResNet-50-UNet++ performs significantly better than five out of the other eight candidate architectures; no significant difference was found in the pairwise comparisons of ResNet-50-UNet++ to ResNet-50-MANet, ResNet-101-MANet, and ResNet-101-UNet++. We then conducted a high-performance computing scaling experiment to compare the number of service units and runtime required for model inferencing on a hypothetical pan-Arctic scale dataset. We found that the ResNet-50-UNet++ model could save up to similar to 54% on service unit expenditure, or similar to 18% on runtime, when considering operational deployment of our mapping approach. Our results suggest that ResNet-50-UNet++ could be the most suitable architecture (out of the nine that were examined) for deep learning-enabled Arctic infrastructure mapping efforts. Overall, our findings regarding the differences between the examined CNN architectures and our methodological framework for multi-objective architecture comparison can provide a foundation that may propel future pan-Arctic GeoAI mapping efforts of infrastructure.

AB Tensor decompositions are powerful tools for dimensionality reduction and feature interpretation of multidimensional data such as signals. Existing tensor decomposition objectives (e.g., Frobenius norm) are designed for fitting raw data under statistical assumptions, which may not align with downstream classification tasks. In practice, raw input tensors can contain irrelevant information, while data augmentation techniques may be used to smooth out class-irrelevant noise in samples. This paper addresses the above challenges by proposing augmented tensor decomposition (ATD), which effectively incorporates data augmentations and self-supervised learning (SSL) to boost downstream classification. To address the non-convexity of the new augmented objective, we develop an iterative method that enables the optimization to follow an alternating least squares (ALS) fashion. We evaluate our proposed ATD on multiple datasets. It can achieve 0.8% similar to 2.5% accuracy gain over tensor-based baselines. Also, our ATD model shows comparable or better performance (e.g., up to 15% in accuracy) over self-supervised and autoencoder baselines while using less than 5% of learnable parameters of these baseline models. We have released our data processing and codes in https://github.com/ycq091044/ATD.

AB A flexible conformal inference method is developed to construct confidence intervals for the frequencies of queried objects in very large data sets, based on a much smaller sketch of those data. The approach is data-adaptive and requires no knowledge of the data distribution or of the details of the sketching algorithm; instead, it constructs provably valid frequentist confidence intervals under the sole assumption of data exchangeability. Although our solution is broadly applicable, this paper focuses on applications involving the count-min sketch algorithm and a non-linear variation thereof. The performance is compared to that of frequentist and Bayesian alternatives through simulations and experiments with data sets of SARS-CoV-2 DNA sequences and classic English literature.

AB Broadband microwave spectra of N-ethyl maleimide (NEM) and N-ethyl succinimide (NES) have been recorded using chirped pulse Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy in the K-a-band (26.5-40 GHz). The spectra for both molecules were fit to a Watson A-reduced Hamiltonian in the I (R) representation to obtain best fit experimental rotational constants (NEM: A(0) = 2143.1988(29), B-0 = 1868.7333(22), C-0 = 1082.98458(36); NES: A(0) = 2061.47756(14), B-0 = 1791.73517(12), C-0 = 1050.31263(11)), centrifugal distortion constants, and nuclear quadrupole coupling constants. While the heavy atoms of the five-membered ring of both molecules are planar, the ethyl chain has its terminal methyl group perpendicular to the ring. Along the relaxed potential energy curve for the ethyl dihedral angle (theta(1) = C(6)-C(5)-N-C(4)), the ethyl group experiences significant steric strain when it is in the plane of the ring, associated with the interaction of the ethyl group with the two carbonyl oxygens. This leads to calculated barriers of theta(1) = 1469 cm(-1) and theta(1) = 1680 cm(-1) in N-ethyl maleimide and N-ethyl succinimide, respectively.

AB Data-driven network models to measure systemic risk in the financial sector and identify "too-connected-to-fail" institutions are becoming increasingly common in financial applications. Existing statistical methods for building such networks either take a pairwise approach of fitting many bivariate models or a system-wide approach of fitting penalized regression models. The former strategy is prone to large false positive selection, while the latter suffers from shrinkage bias and lack of formal inference machinery. These issues are accentuated in small sample, low signal-to-noise settings common in financial data. Building up on recent advances in high-dimensional infera method for building financial networks that addresses these limitations. Our empirical analysis highlights the importance of debiasing in a way that increases power of the algorithm in finite samples. We also provide formal inference guarantees of Granger causality tests in high-dimension to justify our method. We apply DLVAR to the stock returns of U.S. large financial institutions covering the period 1990-2021 and illustrate its usefulness in detecting systemically risky periods and institutions, especially during the Great Financial Crisis of 2008-2009 and the most recent Covid-19 related market shock.

AB Migratory divides, hybrid zones between populations that use different seasonal migration routes, are hypothesised to contribute to speciation. Specifically, relative to parental species, hybrids at divides are predicted to exhibit (1) intermediate migratory behaviour and (2) reduced fitness as a result. We provide the first direct test of the second prediction here with one of the largest existing avian tracking datasets, leveraging a divide between Swainson's thrushes where the first prediction is supported. Using detection rates as a proxy for survival, our results supported the migratory divide hypothesis with lower survival rates for hybrids than parental forms. This finding was juvenile-specific (vs. adults), suggesting selection against hybrids is stronger earlier in life. Reduced hybrid survival was not explained by selection against intermediate phenotypes or negative interactions among phenotypes. Additional work connecting specific features of migration is needed, but these patterns provide strong support for migration as an ecological driver of speciation.
   Predicted survival of migrating Swainson's thrushes depends on their subspecies ancestry (coastal, inland or hybrid), with coastal backcrosses and intermediate hybrids showing reduced survival relative to parental subspecies. Survival was estimated in migrating juveniles using radio tags detected by across North America the Motus station network, with highest detection rates during fall and spring migration.image

ID DISCRIMINATION; BIAS
AB Advertising funds a number of services that play a major role in our everyday online experiences, from social networking, to maps, search, and news. As the power and reach of advertising platforms grow, so do the concerns about the potential for discrimination associated with targeted advertising. However, despite our ever-improving ability to measure and describe instances of unfair distribution of high-stakes ads-such as employment, housing, or credit-we lack the tools to model and predict the extent to which alternative systems could address such problems. In this paper, we simulate an ad distribution system to model the effects that enforcing popularly proposed fairness approaches would have on the utility of the advertising platforms and their users. We show that in many realistic scenarios, achieving statistical parity would come at a much higher utility cost to platforms than enforcing predictive parity or equality of opportunity. Additionally, we identify a tradeoff between different notions of fairness, i.e., enforcing one criterion leads to worse outcomes with respect to other criteria. We further describe how pursuing fairness in situations where one group of users is more expensive to advertise to is likely to result in "leveling down" effects, i.e., not benefiting any group of users. We show that these negative effects can be prevented by ensuring that it is the platforms that carry the cost of fairness rather than passing it on to their users or advertisers. Overall, our findings contribute to ongoing discussions on fair ad delivery. We show that fairness is not satisfied by default, that limiting targeting options is not sufficient to address potential discrimination and bias in online ad delivery, and that choices made by regulators and platforms may backfire if potential side-effects are not properly considered.

AB Conducting research with human subjects can be difficult because of limited sample sizes and small empirical effects. We demonstrate that this problem can yield patterns of results that are practically indistinguishable from flipping a coin to determine the direction of treatment effects. We use this idea of random conclusions to establish a baseline for interpreting effect-size estimates, in turn producing more stringent thresholds for hypothesis testing and for statistical-power calculations. An examination of recent meta-analyses in psychology, neuroscience, and medicine confirms that, even if all considered effects are real, results involving small effects are indeed indistinguishable from random conclusions.

TI Beyond "Taming Electric Scooters": Disentangling Understandings of
   Micromobility Naturalistic Riding
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON INTERACTIVE MOBILE WEARABLE AND UBIQUITOUS
   TECHNOLOGIES-IMWUT
LA English
DT Article
AB Electric(e)-scooters have emerged as a popular, ubiquitous, and first/last-mile micromobility transportation option within and across many cities worldwide. With the increasing situation-awareness and on-board computational capability, such intelligent micromobility has become a critical means of understanding the rider's interactions with other traffic constituents (called Rider-to-X Interactions, , RXIs), such as pedestrians, cars, and other micromobility vehicles, as well as road environments, including curbs, road infrastructures, and traffic signs. How to interpret these complex, dynamic, and context-dependent RXIs, particularly for the rider-centric understandings across different data modalities - such as visual, behavioral, and textual data - is essential for enabling safer and more comfortable micromobility riding experience and the greater good of urban transportation networks. Under a naturalistic riding setting (i.e., without any unnatural constraint on rider's decision-making and maneuvering), we have designed, implemented, and evaluated a pilot Cross-modality E-scooter Naturalistic Riding Understanding System, namely CENRUS, from a human-centered AI perspective. We have conducted an extensive study with CENRUS in sensing, analyzing, and understanding the behavioral, visual, and textual annotation data of RXIs during naturalistic riding. We have also designed a novel, efficient, and usable disentanglement mechanism to conceptualize and understand the e-scooter naturalistic riding processes, and conducted extensive human-centered AI model studies. We have performed multiple downstream tasks enabled by the core model within CENRUS to derive the human-centered AI understandings and insights of complex RXIs, showcasing such downstream tasks as efficient information retrieval and scene understanding. CENRUS can serve as a foundational system for safe and easy-to-use micromobility rider assistance as well as accountable use of micromobility vehicles.

AB We have investigated the concentration and correlation between the macro and micro-elements found in an herbal plant named Ocimum sanctum (Tulsi) leaf, using Particle-Induced X-ray Emission (PIXE) spectroscopy. The leaf area was analyzed with a 2 MeV scanning proton micro-beam with a spot size of similar to 1 square micrometer. This study is focused on exploring the correlation between the elemental maps generated using X-ray spectra with micro-PIXE. Two types of correlations i.e., elemental, and concentration-phase correlations were examined. The elemental maps are used to find the relation between the spatial distribution of the elements present in the scanned region while the correlation maps help in understanding which phase corresponds to the region of selected concentration ratios. All the elemental concentrations were determined with the detection limits in ng/mg. The analysis of macro-elements showed that the potassium concentration was highest and phosphorus exhibited the lowest concentration whereas iron was found to be highest in the category of trace or micro-elements. Moreover, broad-beam runs were also performed on the samples to examine the trend for elemental concentrations.

AB Thanks to many promising properties, including biocompatibility and the ability to experience large deformations, poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) hydrogels are excellent candidate materials for a wide range of applications. Interestingly, the polymerization of PEGDA leads to a network microstructure that is fundamentally different from that of the "classic" polymeric gels. Specifically, PEGDA hydrogels comprise PEG chains that are interconnected by multifunctional densely grafted rod-like polyacrylates (PAs), which serve as cross-linkers. In this work, we derive a microstructurally motivated model that captures the essential features which enable deformation in PEGDA hydrogels: (1) entropic elasticity of PEG chains, (2) deformation of PA rods, and (3) PA-PA interactions. Expressions for the energy-density functions and the stress associated with each of the three contributions are derived. The model demonstrates the microstructural evolution of the network during loading and reveals the role of key microscopic quantities. To validate the model, we fabricate and compress PEGDA hydrogel discs. The model is in excellent agreement with our experimental findings for a broad range of PEGDA compositions. Interestingly, we show that the response of PEGDA hydrogels with short PEG chains and long PA rods is governed by PA-PA interactions, whereas networks with longer PEG chains are dominated by entropy. To enable design, we employ the model to investigate the influence of key microstructural quantities, such as the length of the PEG and the PA chains, on the macroscopic properties and response. The findings from this work pave the way to the efficient design of PEGDA hydrogels with tunable properties and behaviors, which will enable the optimization of their performance in various applications.

TI Distilling the knowledge from large-language model for health event
   prediction
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
DE Health event prediction; Cardiovascular disease; Large-language model;
   Knowledge distillation; Multi-modal learning
AB Health event prediction is empowered by the rapid and wide application of electronic health records (EHR). In the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), precisely predicting the health related events in advance is essential for providing treatment and intervention to improve the patients outcomes. EHR is a kind of multi-modal data containing clinical text, time series, structured data, etc. Most health event prediction works focus on a single modality, e.g., text or tabular EHR. How to effectively learn from the multi-modal EHR for health event prediction remains a challenge. Inspired by the strong capability in text processing of large language model (LLM), we propose the framework CKLE for health event prediction by distilling the knowledge from LLM and learning from multi-modal EHR. There are two challenges of applying LLM in the health event prediction, the first one is most LLM can only handle text data rather than other modalities, e.g., structured data. The second challenge is the privacy issue of health applications requires the LLM to be locally deployed, which may be limited by the computational resource. CKLE solves the challenges of LLM scalability and portability in the healthcare domain by distilling the cross-modality knowledge from LLM into the health event predictive model. To fully take advantage of the strong power of LLM, the raw clinical text is refined and augmented with prompt learning. The embedding of clinical text are generated by LLM. To effectively distill the knowledge of LLM into the predictive model, we design a cross-modality knowledge distillation (KD) method. A specially designed training objective will be used for the KD process with the consideration of multiple modality and patient similarity. The KD loss function consists of two parts. The first one is cross-modality contrastive loss function, which models the correlation of different modalities from the same patient. The second one is patient similarity learning loss function to model the correlations between similar patients. The cross-modality knowledge distillation can distill the rich information in clinical text and the knowledge of LLM into the predictive model on structured EHR data. To demonstrate the effectiveness of CKLE, we evaluate CKLE on two health event prediction tasks in the field of cardiology, heart failure prediction and hypertension prediction. We select the 7125 patients from MIMIC-III dataset and split them into train/validation/test sets. We can achieve a maximum 4.48% improvement in accuracy compared to state-of-the-art predictive model designed for health event prediction. The results demonstrate CKLE can surpass the baseline prediction models significantly on both normal and limited label settings. We also conduct the case study on cardiology disease analysis in the heart failure and hypertension prediction. Through the feature importance calculation, we analyse the salient features related to the cardiology disease which corresponds to the medical domain knowledge. The superior performance and interpretability of CKLE pave a promising way to leverage the power and knowledge of LLM in the health event prediction in real-world clinical settings.

AB The Li-based layered perovskites Li(2)AB(2)O(7) (A = Ca, Sr; B = Nb, Ta) host competing ferroelectric and antiferroelectric states which arise from coupled octahedral rotation distortions and (anti)polar instabilities. We combine density functional theory (DFT) calculations with group theoretic analysis to unravel the mechanism that controls the relative energies of these competing states. We identify transition paths between the competing polar and antipolar states with very low-energy barriers (<3 meV/f.u.), and show that stacking domain walls can facilitate an antipolar-polar transition. We furthermore show that epitaxial strain tunes the relative energy between the polar and antipolar phases. We compare the Li(2)AB(2)O(7) materials to other families of layered perovskite oxide (anti)ferroelectrics.

AB We propose a novel deep learning framework, named SYMHnet, which employs a graph neural network and a bidirectional long short-term memory network to cooperatively learn patterns from solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field parameters for short-term forecasts of the SYM-H index based on 1- and 5-min resolution data. SYMHnet takes, as input, the time series of the parameters' values provided by NASA's Space Science Data Coordinated Archive and predicts, as output, the SYM-H index value at time point t + w hours for a given time point t where w is 1 or 2. By incorporating Bayesian inference into the learning framework, SYMHnet can quantify both aleatoric (data) uncertainty and epistemic (model) uncertainty when predicting future SYM-H indices. Experimental results show that SYMHnet works well at quiet time and storm time, for both 1- and 5-min resolution data. The results also show that SYMHnet generally performs better than related machine learning methods. For example, SYMHnet achieves a forecast skill score (FSS) of 0.343 compared to the FSS of 0.074 of a recent gradient boosting machine (GBM) method when predicting SYM-H indices (1 hr in advance) in a large storm (SYM-H = -393 nT) using 5-min resolution data. When predicting the SYM-H indices (2 hr in advance) in the large storm, SYMHnet achieves an FSS of 0.553 compared to the FSS of 0.087 of the GBM method. In addition, SYMHnet can provide results for both data and model uncertainty quantification, whereas the related methods cannot.
   In the past several years, machine learning and its subfield, deep learning, have attracted considerable interest. Computer vision, natural language processing, and social network analysis make extensive use of machine learning algorithms. Recent applications of these algorithms include the prediction of solar flares and the forecasting of geomagnetic indices. In this paper, we propose an innovative machine learning method that utilizes a graph neural network and a bidirectional long short-term memory network to cooperatively learn patterns from solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field parameters to provide short-term predictions of the SYM-H index. In addition, we present techniques for quantifying both data and model uncertainties in the output of the proposed method.
   SYMHnet is a novel deep learning method for making short-term predictions of the SYM-H index (1 or 2 hr in advance) With Bayesian inference, SYMHnet can quantify both aleatoric (data) and epistemic (model) uncertainties in making its prediction SYMHnet generally performs better than related machine learning methods for SYM-H forecasting

AB We propose Bayesian nonparametric Weibull delegate racing (WDR) to fill the gap in interpretable nonlinear survival analysis with competing events, left truncation, and time -varying covariates. We set a two-phase race among a potentially infinite number of sub -events to model nonlinear covariate effects, which does not rely on transformations or complex functions of the covariates. Using gamma processes, the nonlinear capacity of WDR is parsimonious and data-adaptive. In prediction accuracy, WDR dominates cause -specific Cox and Fine-Gray models and is comparable to random survival forests in the presence of time-invariant covariates. More importantly, WDR can cope with different types of censoring, missing outcomes, left truncation, and time-varying covariates, on which other nonlinear models, such as the random survival forests, Gaussian processes, and deep learning approaches, are largely silent. We develop an efficient MCMC algorithm based on Gibbs sampling. We analyze biomedical data, interpret disease progression affected by covariates, and show the potential of WDR in discovering and diagnosing new diseases.

TI Monolithic three-dimensional integration of complementary

SO NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB The semiconductor industry is transitioning to the 'More Moore' era, driven by the adoption of three-dimensional (3D) integration schemes surpassing the limitations of traditional two-dimensional scaling. Although innovative packaging solutions have made 3D integrated circuits (ICs) commercially viable, the inclusion of through-silicon vias and microbumps brings about increased area overhead and introduces parasitic capacitances that limit overall performance. Monolithic 3D integration (M3D) is regarded as the future of 3D ICs, yet its application faces hurdles in silicon ICs due to restricted thermal processing budgets in upper tiers, which can degrade device performance. To overcome these limitations, emerging materials like carbon nanotubes and two-dimensional semiconductors have been integrated into the back end of silicon ICs. Here we report the M3D integration of complementary WSe2 FETs, in which n-type FETs are placed in tier 1 and p-type FETs are placed in tier 2. In particular, we achieve dense and scaled integration through 300nm vias with a pitch of <1 mu m, connecting more than 300 devices in tiers 1 and 2. Moreover, we have effectively implemented vertically integrated logic gates, encompassing inverters, NAND gates and NOR gates. Our demonstration highlights the two-dimensional materials' role in advancing M3D integration in complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor circuits.

AB Transitions of biological tissues between solid-like and liquid-like phases have been of great recent interest. Here, the first successful cell-by-cell evaluation of tissue viscoelastic transition is presented. An in situ micro-mechanical perturbation is applied to a microtissue, and the resulting volumetric deformation is evaluated using 3D light-sheet microscopy and digital image correlation (DIC), quantifying both solid-like, well-aligned displacement and liquid-like swirling motion between individual cells. The viscoelastic transition of fibroblasts is crucial in fundamental physiological events, such as placentation, cancer dissemination, and wound healing. This study investigates 3D organoid systems modeling maternal-fetal and tumor-stroma interfaces, demonstrating established molecular and structural parallels. The analysis visualizes individual cells in stromal-epithelial interactions and how they collectively alter tissue viscoelastic properties. It also enables in-silico microdissection, linking single-cell viscoelasticity with multi-channel fluorescence. RNAseq analysis of endometrial stromal fibroblasts shows that decidualization activates mechano-transcriptional regulators, including myocardin-related transcription factors (MRTFs), associated with increased cellular contractility and actomyosin mobilization. Knocking down MRTFA in cancer-associated fibroblasts in the tumor-fibroblast co-culture 3D model induces significant changes in fibroblast properties, mirroring those observed in the maternal-fetal interface model, highlighting parallels between placentation and cancer invasion. This analysis confirms existing beliefs and discovers new insights broadly applicable to studying organoids, embryos, tumors, and other tissues.

TI Impact of WindBorne Observation Assimilation on Prediction of a TPV

AB The impact of assimilating in situ temperature, moisture and wind observations from a WindBorne Systems balloon, with long duration and adjustable ballast, is evaluated using a case study from the 2022 THINICE field campaign. A case is selected wherein the WindBorne balloon directly sampled a jet streak associated with a tropopause polar vortex (TPV). The observed TPV merged with another TPV at the same time as a downstream Arctic cyclone (AC) redeveloped eastward. The case is used to better understand the role of the observed TPV in the evolution of the downstream AC. The assimilation of the WindBorne observations improves the forecast track and amplitude of the TPV during the similar to 1 day forecast period that the TPV can be tracked as a distinct feature. The root mean square error of temperature at 350 hPa is improved by the WindBorne assimilation throughout the 2.5 day forecast period. The surface cyclone track forecast is improved by the WindBorne assimilation during the period of eastward redevelopment of the surface cyclone, and the sea level pressure RMSE in the surrounding region is reduced during the first similar to 1.5 days of forecast lead time. Results demonstrate the capability of the long-duration controllable WindBorne balloons to improve the analysis of the TPV associated with the jet streak, leading to improved forecast of both tropopause-level and surface pressure features. Additionally, the importance of observing the upstream TPV amplitude for improving forecasts of the process of TPV merging and its impact on the evolution and longevity of the mature AC is confirmed.
   During a recent field campaign, WindBorne Systems deployed novel weather balloons that remain in the atmosphere for weeks at a time, adjusting their altitude to follow winds towards features of interest. These balloons provide an opportunity to study the impact of the merging of two upper-level disturbances on the performance of an Arctic cyclone (AC) forecast. WindBorne observations of one of the two merged disturbances allowed for an improved forecast of the eastward redevelopment of the AC. These experiments confirm the importance of observing such features for AC prediction and the importance of the merging process in the maintenance and evolution of long-lived Arctic cyclones.
   WindBorne balloons can improve in situ sampling of small scale features critical for Arctic predictability Tropopause polar vortex (TPV)-related jet streak is important for predictability of subsequent TPV merging and Arctic cyclone (AC) redevelopment Merging of TPVs without associated surface cyclone should be included in conceptual models of AC longevity

AB We investigate the concept of effective resistance in connection graphs, expanding its traditional application from undirected graphs. We propose a robust definition of effective resistance in connection graphs by focusing on the duality of Dirichlet-type and Poisson-type problems on connection graphs. Additionally, we delve into random walks, taking into account both node transitions and vector rotations. This approach introduces novel concepts of effective conductance and resistance matrices for connection graphs, capturing mean rotation matrices corresponding to random walk transitions. Thereby, it provides new theoretical insights for network analysis and optimization.

AB Polymeric membranes fabricated via the nonsolvent-induced phase separation process rely heavily on toxic aprotic organic solvents, like N-methyl-pyrrolidine (NMP) and dimethylformamide. We suggest that the "saloplastic" nature of polyelectrolyte complexes (PECs) makes them an excellent candidate for fabricating next-generation water purification membranes that use a more sustainable aqueous phase separation process. In this study, we investigate how the properties of PECs and their interactions with salt can form pore-containing membranes from the strong polyelectrolytes poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS) and poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC) in the presence of potassium bromide (KBr). How the single-phase polymer-rich (coacervate) dope solution and coagulation bath impacted the formation, morphology, and pure water permeance (PWP) of the membranes was systematically evaluated by using scanning electron microscopy and dead-end filtration tests. The impact of a salt annealing post-treatment process was also tested; these treated PEC membranes exhibited a PWP of 6.2 L m-2 h-1 bar-1 and a dye removal of 91.7% and 80.5% for methyl orange and methylene blue, respectively, which are on par with commercial poly(ether sulfone) nanofiltration membranes. For the first time, we have demonstrated the ability of the PEC membranes to repel Escherichia coli bacteria under static conditions. Our fundamental study of polyelectrolyte membrane pore-forming mechanisms and separation performance could help drive the future development of sustainable materials for membrane-based separations.

AB GW170817 and GRB 170817A provided direct evidence that binary neutron star (NSNS) mergers can produce short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs). However, questions remain about the nature of the central engine. Depending on the mass, the remnant from a NSNS merger may promptly collapse to a black hole (BH), form a hypermassive neutron star (HMNS) which undergoes a delayed collapse to a BH, a supramassive neutron star (SMNS) with a much longer lifetime, or an indefinitely stable NS with a mass below the TOV limit. There is strong evidence that a BH with an accretion disk can launch a sGRBcompatible jet via the Blandford-Znajek mechanism, but whether a supramassive star can do the same is less clear. We have performed general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations of the merger of both irrotational and spinning, equal-mass NSNSs constructed from a piecewise polytropic representation of the nuclear SLy equation of state, with a range of gravitational masses that yield remnants with mass above and below the supramassive limit. Each NS is endowed with a dipolar magnetic field extending from the interior into the exterior, as in a radio pulsar. We examine cases with different initial binary masses, including a case which produces a HMNS which collapses to a BH, and lower mass binaries that produce SMNS remnants. We find similar jetlike structures (helical magnetic field structures, a magnetically dominated evacuated funnel, and mildly relativistic outflow from the poles) for both the SMNS and HMNS remnants that meet our basic criteria for an incipient jet. The outflow for the HMNS case is consistent with a Blandford-Znajek (BZ) jet. There is sufficient evidence that such BZ-powered outflows can break out and produce ultrarelativistic jets so that we can describe the HMNS system as a sGRB progenitor. However, the incipient jets from the SMNS remnants have much more baryon pollution and we see indications of inefficient outflow acceleration and mixing with the surrounding debris torus. Therefore, we cannot conclude that outflows from SMNSs are the progenitors of sGRBs.

AB Graph mining algorithms have been playing a significant role in myriad fields over the years. However, despite their promising performance on various graph analytical tasks, most of these algorithms lack fairness considerations. As a consequence, they could lead to discrimination towards certain populations when exploited in human-centered applications. Recently, algorithmic fairness has been extensively studied in graph-based applications. In contrast to algorithmic fairness on independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data, fairness in graph mining has exclusive backgrounds, taxonomies, and fulfilling techniques. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and up-to-date introduction of existing literature under the context of fair graph mining. Specifically, we propose a novel taxonomy of fairness notions on graphs, which sheds light on their connections and differences. We further present an organized summary of existing techniques that promote fairness in graph mining. Finally, we discuss current research challenges and open questions, aiming at encouraging cross-breeding ideas and further advances.

ID ISOTROPIC TURBULENCE; DECAYING TURBULENCE; GRID TURBULENCE
AB Random jet arrays (RJAs) have been shown to be effective in generating zero mean flow homogeneous isotropic turbulence. While many laboratory studies have investigated the flow in these facilities, there are several remaining questions regarding the evolution of turbulence, from the development of turbulence to where it decays, along with understanding how input energy from the jet array transfers into different turbulent flow characteristics. To address these questions, we perform a series of laboratory experiments in which we alter the parameters of the randomized algorithm, along with the jet spacing and outlet velocity of the jets. We first determine the location where turbulence transitions to a fully developed state and show that it is a function of jet penetration length, LJ, J , and effective jet spacing, S e . We identify three distinct regions for the spatial decay of turbulence in RJA facilities and notably, we find different decay rates, unlike previous studies that report only one spatial decay rate using similar facilities. These regions are shown to depend on the variations of input parameters yet independent of the strength of the mean flow. We also find the strength of the mean flow does not affect the homogeneity, nor the production, transport, or advection terms of the turbulent kinetic energy budget equation. Finally, we address a longstanding question toward estimating turbulence metrics with an RJA based on the input parameters. We define an efficiency parameter that provides insight into the transfer rate of input power to the dissipation rate of the generated turbulence.

TI Unambiguous Fluctuation Decomposition of the Self-Energy: Pseudogap
   Physics beyond Spin Fluctuations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
ID MONTE-CARLO; SYSTEMS
AB Correlated electron systems may give rise to multiple effective interactions whose combined impact on quasiparticle properties can be difficult to disentangle. We introduce an unambiguous decomposition of the electronic self-energy which allows us to quantify the contributions of various effective interactions simultaneously. We use this tool to revisit the hole-doped Hubbard model within the dynamical cluster approximation, where commonly spin fluctuations are considered to be the origin of the pseudogap. While our fluctuation decomposition confirms that spin fluctuations indeed suppress antinodal electronic spectral weight, we show that they alone cannot capture the pseudogap self-energy quantitatively. Nonlocal multiboson Feynman diagrams yield substantial contributions and are needed for a quantitative description of the pseudogap.

AB For rapid civil infrastructure assessment following natural and man-made emergencies, the utilization of minimally invasive and cost-effective drone deployable sensor packages has the potential to become a valuable tool. Although compact sensors with wireless data transfer capabilities have proven effective in monitoring the structural dynamics of infrastructure, these systems require data processing to occur externally, frequently off-site. These extra steps impede the high-speed assessment of a structure's state. Difficulties can arise when the transmission is unfeasible due to degraded communication links during natural or man-made emergencies. Additionally, off-site data processing can add unneeded interruptions to actions that can be taken by emergency personnel after infrastructure damage. To enhance the effectiveness of sensor packages in expediting infrastructure assessment, incorporating real-time data analysis through embedded edge computing techniques emerges as a promising solution. The objective of this work is to demonstrate on-device data processing for frequency-based structural health monitoring techniques using drone-deployable sensors. This approach advances the effectiveness of drone-deployable sensors in rapid infrastructure assessment by mitigating their susceptibility to errors or delays in data communications. The proposed approach computes the frequency components of vibration measurements taken from a structure of interest, for example, the monitoring of a bridge immediately following a damaging event such as a flood. This work presents contributions in terms of outlining a methodology that emphasizes the hardware-based implementation of edge computing algorithms and examines the required on-device performance and resource utilization for structural health monitoring at the edge. The execution time for the sensor's edge computing functions was profiled, resulting in an additional 9.77 seconds per test, an advancement over traditional transmit and analyze methods.

AB Solvents are so nearly omnipresent in synthetic chemistry that a classic question for their use has been: "What is the best solvent for this reaction?" The increasing use of mechanochemical approaches to synthesis-by grinding, milling, extrusion, or other means-and usually with no, or only limited, amounts of solvent, has raised an alternative question for the synthetic chemist: "What happens if there is no solvent?" This review focuses on a three-part answer to that question: when there is little change ("solvent-optional" reactions); when solvent needs to be present in some form, even if only in the amounts provided by liquid-assisted (LAG) or solvate-assisted grinding; and those cases in which mechanochemistry allows access to compounds that cannot be obtained from solution-based routes. The emphasis here is on inorganic and organometallic systems, including selected examples of mechanosynthesis and mechanocatalysis. Issues of mechanochemical depictions and the adequacy of LAG descriptions are also reviewed.
   Solution-based reactions are a staple of synthetic chemistry-but what happens mechanochemically, when there is no solvent?

AB Reliable sensing of road conditions during flooding can facilitate safe and efficient emergency response, reduce vehicle-related fatalities, and enhance community resilience. Existing situational awareness tools typically depend on limited data sources or simplified models, rendering them inadequate for sensing dynamically evolving roadway conditions. Consequently, roadway-related incidents are a leading cause of flood fatalities (40%-60%) in many developed countries. While an extensive network of physical sensors could improve situational awareness, they are expensive to operate at scale. This study proposes an alternative-a framework that leverages existing data sources, including physical, social, and visual sensors and physics-based models, to sense road conditions. It uses source-specific data collection and processing, data fusion and augmentation, and network and spatial analyses workflows to infer flood impacts at link and network levels. A limited case study application of the framework in Houston, Texas, indicates that repurposing existing data sources can improve roadway situational awareness. This framework offers a paradigm shift for improving mobility-centric situational awareness using open-source tools, existing data sources, and modern algorithms, thus offering a practical solution for communities. The paper's contributions are timely: it provides an equitable framework to improve situational awareness in an epoch of climate change and exacerbating urban flood risk.

AB A human laryngeal model, incorporating all the cartilages and the intrinsic muscles, was reconstructed based on MRI data. The vocal fold was represented as a multilayer structure with detailed inner components. The activation levels of the thyroarytenoid (TA) and cricothyroid (CT) muscles were systematically varied from zero to full activation allowing for the analysis of their interaction and influence on vocal fold dynamics and glottal flow. The finite element method was employed to calculate the vocal fold dynamics, while the one-dimensional Bernoulli equation was utilized to calculate the glottal flow. The analysis was focused on the muscle influence on the fundamental frequency (fo). We found that while CT and TA activation increased the fo in most of the conditions, TA activation resulted in a frequency drop when it was moderately activated. We show that this frequency drop was associated with the sudden increase of the vertical motion when the vibration transited from involving the whole tissue to mainly in the cover layer. The transition of the vibration pattern was caused by the increased body-cover stiffness ratio that resulted from TA activation.

AB Cadmium telluride (CdTe) is a highly promising material for photovoltaics (PV) and photodetectors due to its light-absorbing properties. However, efficient design and use of flexible devices require a deep understanding of its atomic-level deformation mechanism. Herein, uniaxial compression deformation of CdTe monocrystalline with varying crystal orientations is investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) with a newly developed machine-learning force field (ML-FF), alongside in-situ micropillar compression experiments. The findings reveal that CdTe bulk deformation is dominated by reversible martensitic phase transformation, whereas CdTe pillar deformation is primarily driven by dislocation nucleation and movement. CdTe monocrystals possess exceptional super-recoverable deformation along the <100> orientation due to hyper-elastic processes induced by martensitic transformation. This discovery not only sheds light on the peculiarities observed in micropillar experimental measurements, but also provides pivotal insights into the fundamental deformation behaviors of CdTe and similar II-VI compounds under various stress conditions. These insights are crucial for the innovative design and enhanced functionality of future flexible electronic devices.

For the hypercube case, a breakthrough result of Khot-Minzer-Safra (FOCS 2015) gave a non-adaptive, one-sided tester making (O) over tilde (epsilon(-2)root d) queries. Up to polylog d and epsilon factors, this bound matches the (Omega) over tilde (epsilon root d)-query non-adaptive lower bound (Chen-De-Servedio-Tan (STOC 2015), Chen-Waingarten-Xie (STOC 2017)). For any n > 2, the optimal non-adaptive complexity was unknown. A previous result of the authors achieves a (O) over tilde (d(5/6))-query upper bound (SODA 2020), quite far from the root d bound for the hypercube.
   In this paper, we resolve the non-adaptive complexity of monotonicity testing for all constant n, up to poly(epsilon(-1) log d) factors. Specifically, we give a non-adaptive, one-sided monotonicity tester making (O) over tilde (epsilon(-2) n root d) queries. From a technical standpoint, we prove newdirected isoperimetric theorems over the hypergrid [n](d). These results generalize the celebrated directed Talagrand inequalities that were only known for the hypercube.

AB The use of photopolymerization is expanding across a multitude of biomedical applications, from drug delivery to bioprinting. Many of these current and emerging photopolymerization systems employ visible light, as motivated by safety and energy efficiency considerations. However, the "library" of visible light initiators is limited compared with the wealth of options available for UV polymerization. Furthermore, the synthesis of traditional photoinitiators relies on diminishing raw materials, and several traditional photoinitiators are considered emerging environmental contaminants. As such, there has been recent focus on identifying and characterizing biologically sourced, visible light-based photoinitiator systems that can be effectively used in photopolymerization applications. In this regard, several bio-sourced molecules have been shown to act as photoinitiators, primarily through Type II photoinitiation mechanisms. However, whether bio-sourced molecules can also act as effective synergists in these reactions remains unknown. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of bio-sourced synergist candidates, with a focus on amino acids, due to their amine functional groups, in combination with two bio-sourced photoinitiator molecules: riboflavin and curcumin. We tested the effectiveness of these photoinitiator systems under both violet (405 nm) and blue (460-475 nm) light using photo-rheology. We found that several synergist candidates, namely lysine, arginine, and histidine, increased the polymerization effectiveness of riboflavin when used with both violet and blue light. With curcumin, we found that almost all tested synergist candidates slightly decreased the polymerization effectiveness compared with curcumin alone under both light sources. These results show that bio-sourced molecules have the potential to be used as synergists with bio-sourced photoinitiators in visible light photopolymerization. However, more work must be done to fully characterize these reactions and to investigate more synergist candidates. Ultimately, this information is expected to expand the range of available visible light-based photoinitiator systems and increase their sustainability.
   Biologically sourced molecules can be used as both initiators (riboflavin and curcumin) and synergists (amino acids) in visible light-based photopolymerization reactions. The use of bio-sourced molecules as alternativesto cytotoxic, synthetic photoinitiators can increase the safety and sustainability of photopolymerization, which is particularly important in biomedical applications. image

AB Current phonon transport theory based on ground-state calculations has been successful in predicting thermal conductivity at room and medium temperatures but may misrepresent behavior at high temperatures. In this work, we predict the thermal conductivity (kappa) of ZrC including electronic and phonon contributions from 300 to 3500 K, by including high-order phonon scattering; lattice expansion; temperature-dependent (TD) second-, third-, and fourth-order force constants (2FC, 3FC, and 4FC); and interband phonon conduction by using first principles. For the phonon transport, we find that four-phonon scattering (4(ph)) significantly reduces the phonon thermal conductivity (kappa(ph)), by as much as similar to 75% at 3500 K. After including 4ph scattering and all other factors,.ph shows a similar to T -1.5 rather than similar to T -1 dependence. TD 2FC decreases three-phonon scattering rates but increases 4ph rates by decreasing and increasing the scattering phase spaces, respectively. For 4ph phase space, the TD 2FC flattens phonon bands, and allows more redistribution-4ph processes (1 + 2. 3 + 4) to happen. The combination effect of TD 2FC and TD 4FC reduces 4ph rates of acoustic modes but increases those of optical modes. The TD 3FC and 4FC decrease the phonon scattering cross section and increase the.ph significantly (by 52% at 3500 K). The contribution from interband (Wigner) phonon conduction is small, even at ultrahigh temperatures. For electronic thermal transport, we find that it is sensitive to and can be changed by 20% by the TD lattice constants. The Lorenz number varies from 1.6 to 3.3 x 10-8W similar to K-2 at different temperatures. The theoretical prediction in the literature overpredicts.ph (e.g., similar to 28%) and underpredicts the.el (e.g., similar to 38%), resulting in an overall underprediction of. (similar to 26% at 1500 K). The impacts of grain size and defects are found to be strong, leading to the lower observed thermal conductivity in experiments.

ID CIRCULAR-DICHROISM; FABRICATION
AB The inherently weak chiroptical responses of natural materials limit their usage for controlling and enhancing chiral light-matter interactions. Recently, several nanostructures with subwavelength scale dimensions were demonstrated, mainly due to the advent of nanofabrication technologies, as a potential alternative to efficiently enhance chirality. However, the intrinsic lossy nature of metals and the inherent narrowband response of dielectric planar thin films or metasurface structures pose severe limitations toward the practical realization of broadband and tailorable chiral systems. Here, we tackle these problems by designing all-dielectric silicon-based L-shaped optical metamaterials based on tilted nanopillars that exhibit broadband and enhanced chiroptical response in transmission operation. We use an emerging bottom-up fabrication approach, named glancing angle deposition, to assemble these dielectric metamaterials on a wafer scale. The reported strong chirality and optical anisotropic properties are controllable in terms of both amplitude and operating frequency by simply varying the shape and dimensions of the nanopillars. The presented nanostructures can be used in a plethora of emerging nanophotonic applications, such as chiral sensors, polarization filters, and spin-locked nanowaveguides.
   L-shaped silicon metamaterials are realized exhibiting broadband and enhanced chirality. The current work sets new benchmarks in the assembly of ultrathin dielectric chiral metamaterials that can efficiently control chiral light-matter interactions.

AB Many pathologies are related to hemodynamic changes occurring at the microvascular level, where small vessels pierce the tissue, perfusing it with blood. Since there is a large number of vessels of small caliber, it is impractical to model the fluid flow through each one of them separately, as it is done in the case of large arteries using, for example, the Navier-Stokes equations. As an alternative, tissue perfusion is modeled here via three-dimensional (3D) partial differential equations (PDEs) for fluid flow through deformable porous media, where blood vessels are modeled as pores within a deformable solid representing the tissue. Since it is known that the local perfusion is related to the systemic features of surrounding blood circulation, we couple the PDE system with a zero-dimensional (0D) lumped circuit model, obtained by the analogy between fluid flows in hydraulic networks and current flowing in electrical circuits. An important feature in this multiscale 3D-0D coupling is the specification of interface conditions between the 3D and the 0D parts of the system. In this article, we focus on two types of interface conditions driven by physical considerations, and compare the behavior of the solutions for the two different scenarios.

AB This second paper in a series of two describes the chirped-pulse ice apparatus that permits the detection of buffer gas cooled molecules desorbed from an energetically processed ice using broadband mm-wave rotational spectroscopy. Here, we detail the lower ice stage developed to generate ices at 4 K, which can then undergo energetic processing via UV/VUV photons or high-energy electrons and which ultimately enter the gas phase via temperature-programmed desorption (TPD). Over the course of TPD, the lower ice stage is interfaced with a buffer gas cooling cell that allows for sensitive detection via chirped-pulse rotational spectroscopy in the 60-90 GHz regime. In addition to a detailed description of the ice component of this apparatus, we show proof-of-principle experiments demonstrating the detection of H2CO products formed through irradiation of neat methanol ices or 1:1 CO + CH4 mixed ices.

AB Aerosols can be modeled for detailed investigations using reverse micelles in the laboratory as well as in computational simulations. A long-standing question in the description of confined water under these conditions is that of a two-state model of core - interface or a three-state model of core - intermediate - interface. In this work, we present results of analysis of water dynamics inside reverse micelles from fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. The size and composition of reverse micelles is expressed through w0, the ratio of the number of water molecules to the number of surfactant molecules. Reverse micelles of diverse sizes, with w0 ranging from 5 to 20, were constructed with Sodium bis(2-ethylhexyl) sulfosuccinate (AOT) surfactant and simulated within isooctane solvent. Residence time and diffusion coefficients, in the simulations, both behaved increasingly like bulk water with the increase in size of reverse micelles. Rotational anisotropy autocorrelation was modeled using exponential func-tions in the short time range of 10-20 ps and longer time data were modeled as a power law fit. Similarly, the diffusion of water in the reverse micelles was also modeled on a power law fit. All these metrics demonstrate a clear progression towards bulk water behavior as the reverse micelle size increases. Additionally, our results also support a 3-layer model of water in a reverse micelle of core - intermediate - interface. These results extend the understanding of water dynamics in reverse micelles and provide further evidence for the 3-layer model.(c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Perhaps the most dynamic component of the Arctic sea ice cover is the marginal ice zone (MIZ), the transitional region between dense pack ice to the north and open ocean to the south. It widens by a factor of four while seasonally migrating more than 1600 km poleward in the Bering-Chukchi Sea sector, impacting climate dynamics, ecological processes, and human accessibility to the Arctic. Here we showcase a transformative mathematical modeling approach to understanding changes in MIZ location and width, focusing on their seasonal cycles as observed by satellites. We view the MIZ as a liquid-solid phase transition region, or mushy zone, on the scale of the Arctic Ocean. Invoking the physics of phase changes, the MIZ is modeled as a dynamic, multiscale composite material layer; this model captures 96% of the annual cycle of MIZ location and 78% of the annual cycle of MIZ width. Temperature in the upper ocean is described by a nonlinear heat equation with effective parameters obtained using homogenization theory for a random medium of ice floes in a sea water host. Observations and simulations together indicate that MIZ location closely tracks the below-ice 273 K isotherm while the width of the MIZ follows vertical heat flux convergence, but with a three-week lag.

AB Hydrous and nominally anhydrous minerals are a fundamental class of solids of enormous significance to geophysics. They are the water carriers in the deep geological water cycle and impact structural, elastic, plastic, and thermodynamic properties and phase relations in Earth's forming aggregates (rocks). They play a critical role in the geochemical and geophysical processes that shape the planet. Their complexity has prevented predictive calculations of their properties, but progress in materials simulations ushered by machine-learning potentials is transforming this state of affairs. Here, we adopt a hybrid approach that combines deep learning potentials (DPs) with the strongly constrained and appropriately normed meta-generalized gradient approximation functional to simulate a prototypical hydrous system. We illustrate the success of this approach to simulate 8-AlOOH (8), a phase capable of transporting water down to near the core-mantle boundary of the Earth (similar to 2900 km depth and similar to 135 GPa) in subducting slabs. A high-throughput sampling of phase space using molecular dynamics simulations with DPs sheds light on the hydrogen-bond behavior and proton diffusion at geophysical conditions. These simulations provide a pathway for a deeper understanding of these crucial components that shape Earth's internal state.

AB Searches for new physics in the top quark sector are of great theoretical interest, yet some powerful avenues for discovery remain unexplored. We characterize the expected statistical power of the LHC dataset to constrain the single production of heavy top partners T decaying to a top quark and a photon or a top quark and a gluon. We describe an effective interaction which could generate such production, though the limits apply to a range of theoretical models. We find sensitivity to cross sections in the 102 - 105 fb range, for T masses between 300 and 1000 GeV, depending on decay mode.

AB We study an online allocation problem with sequentially arriving items and adversarially chosen agent values, with the goal of balancing fairness and efficiency. Our goal is to study the performance of algorithms that achieve strong guarantees under other input models such as stochastic inputs, in order to achieve robust guarantees against a variety of inputs. To that end, we study the PACE (Pacing According to Current Estimated utility) algorithm, an existing algorithm designed for stochastic input. We show that in the equal-budgets case, PACE is equivalent to an integral greedy algorithm. We go on to show that with natural restrictions on the adversarial input model, both the greedy allocation and PACE have asymptotically bounded multiplicative envy as well as competitive ratio for Nash welfare, with the multiplicative factors either constant or with optimal order dependence on the number of agents. This completes a "best-of-many-worlds" guarantee for PACE, since past work showed that PACE achieves guarantees for stationary and stochastic-but-non-stationary input models.

AB This study was to determine the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater samples from two wastewater treatment plants in Baltimore over a period of one year. The samples were concentrated by the Polyethylene Glycol 8000 (PEG) method, and RNA fragments were extracted using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit. RT-PCR and qPCR assays were performed, and Cq values below 40 were analyzed and presented as gene copies/L. N1 and N2 genes were detected in both WWTP samples, with N1 ranging from 1.38 to 3.34 log10 gc/l and N2 ranging from 1.88 to 3.20 log10 gc/l. COVID-19 hospitalization cases in Baltimore County and City were observed to be 40-42 % positively correlated with the copies of N-genes detected in the WWTP-A. On the contrary, the N-genes (N1 and N2) from both WWTPs exhibited a very weak positive and negative relationship with wastewater physical parameters such as pH, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solutes, salinity, and temperature. The reduction in positive correlation with hospitalization cases could be attributed to an increase in immunity amongst the population surveyed. There is a need to ascertain the effect of physical parameters changes from the sampling point to the processing point on the capture and detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater.

AB An experimentally demonstrated, vertical chip-to-chip evanescent coupler between silicon nitride (SiNx$_{x}$) and silicon (Si) is presented with the coupler loss measured to be 0.39 +/-$\pm$ 1.06 dB at 1550 nm with a 1-dB bandwidth of 160 nm extending across the C-band, S-band, and L-band (1480-1640 nm). The average coupling loss is determined to be 0.73 dB for the 1480-1640 nm wavelength range with a +/-$\pm$2 sigma tolerance of +/-$\pm$0.92 dB. The 1-dB lateral alignment tolerance is 1.56 +/-$\pm$ 0.14 mu m at 1550 nm and the average tolerance is 1.38 +/-$\pm$ 0.24 mu m across the 1480-1640 nm wavelength regime. In addition, the average coupling loss varies by less than +/-$\pm$0.35 dB and the average 1-dB alignment tolerance varies by less than +/-$\pm$30 nm for temperatures varying from 23 to 60 degrees C. Finally, the average coupling loss range is less than 1.5 dB range across four sets of identically packaged die. This is the first experimental demonstration of an interchip, passively assembled evanescent coupler using standard complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor foundry processes for directly coupling between Si and SiNx$_{x}$, overcoming a waveguide refractive index difference of Delta n$\Delta n$ = 1.32 without requiring taper tip widths of less than 100 nm.

AB Pyrroloiminoquinone alkaloids are a large class of natural products that display a wide range of biological activities. Synthetic approaches to these natural products typically rely on a common late-stage C10-oxygenated pyrroloiminoquinone intermediate, but these strategies often lead to lengthy synthetic sequences that are not amenable to divergent syntheses. We devised an alternative approach aimed at the early introduction of the C10 nitrogen, which we hypothesized would enable late-stage diversification. This strategy hinged upon a Larock/Buchwald-Hartwig annulation/cyclization to quickly access the core of these alkaloids. We report the development of this cascade process, which was facilitated by a dual ligand system in addition to selective functionalization of the key intermediate, to provide efficient syntheses of makaluvamines A, C, and D and isobatzelline B, and the first total synthesis of makaluvamine N.
   Herein, we report a novel approach to pyrroloiminoquinones which was enabled by the development of a Larock/Buchwald-Hartwig annulation/cyclization cascade to rapidly construct the core, which was further elaborated to 5 of these natural products.

AB The interaction of tetramethylammonium acetate with [(MeCN)(2)Ni(CF3)(2)], [(MeCN)(2)Ni(C2F5)(2)], and [NMe4][(MeCN)Ni(CF3)(3)] was explored by F-19 NMR spectroscopy. We show that depending on the nature of the nickel complex, one or two acetate ligands can add to the metal center and replace the nickel-bound MeCN ligands, depending on the acetate concentration. The number of acetates that could bind to nickel, and whether the resulting complex exists as a monomer or dimer, was determined to be dependent on the nature of the fluoroalkyl ligand. Moreover, we observe that oxidation of the nickel center of [(MeCN)(2)Ni(CF3)(2)] in the presence of two equivalents of acetate leads cleanly to the octahedral, paramagnetic (EPR spectroscopy), and anionic Ni(III) complex [NMe4][Ni(CF3)(2)(OAc)(2)].

   protection
AB 100% inverter-based renewable units are becoming more prevalent, introducing new challenges in the protection of microgrids that incorporate these resources. This is particularly due to low fault currents and bidirectional flows. Previous work has studied the protection of microgrids with high penetration of inverter-interfaced distributed generators; however, very few have studied the protection of a 100% inverter-based microgrid. This work proposes machine learning (ML)-based protection solutions using local electrical measurements that consider implementation challenges and effectively combine short-circuit fault detection and type identification. A decision tree method is used to analyze a wide range of fault scenarios. PSCAD/EMTDC simulation environment is used to create a dataset for training and testing the proposed method. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is examined under seven distinct fault types, each featuring varying fault resistance, in a 100% inverter-based microgrid consisting of four inverters.

AB Magnetic fields are a defining yet enigmatic aspect of the interstellar medium, with their three-dimensional (3D) mapping posing a substantial challenge. In this study, we harness the innovative velocity gradient technique (VGT), underpinned by magnetohydrodynamic turbulence theories, to map the magnetic field structure by applying it to the atomic neutral hydrogen (H I) emission line and the molecular tracer (CO)-C-12. We construct the tomography of the magnetic field in the low-mass star-forming region L1688, utilizing two approaches: (1) VGT-H I combined with the Galactic rotational curve, and (2) stellar polarization paired with precise star parallax measurements. Our analysis reveals that the magnetic field orientations deduced from stellar polarization undergo a distinct directional change in the vicinity of L1688, providing evidence that the misalignment between VGT-H I and stellar polarization stems from the influence of the molecular cloud's magnetic field on the polarization of starlight. When comparing VGT-(CO)-C-12 to stellar polarization and Planck polarization data, we observe that VGT-(CO)-C-12 effectively reconciles the misalignment noted with VGT-H I, showing statistical alignment with Planck polarization measurements. This indicates that VGT-(CO)-C-12 could be integrated with VGT-H I, offering vital insights into the magnetic fields of molecular clouds, thereby enhancing the accuracy of our 3D magnetic field reconstructions.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B

AB Topological theory predicts the necessary conditions for robust dimensional reduction in a host of quantum and classical systems. Models have recently been proposed for stochastic systems which describe many biological and chemical phenomena. However, general theoretical principles are lacking for this class of systems, exemplified by the breakdown of the celebrated bulk-edge correspondence. We prove that contrary to topological phases in quantum and many classical systems, stochastic systems require nonreciprocal (or non-Hermitian) transitions for robust edge responses, which holds across all dimensions and geometries. We propose a novel explanation of hybridization that destroys edge responses in reciprocal (Hermitian) stochastic systems. Further, we show that stochastic steady states grow dramatically with nonreciprocity, in contrast to their quantum counterparts which plateaus. We analyze the resulting theoretical and physical consequences and how nonreciprocity mitigates the effects of hybridization towards robust edge states in equilibrium and nonequilibrium steady states. These results establish the crucial role of nonreciprocal interactions for responses that are robust to random perturbations in active and living matter.

AB Intraspecific variation can be as great as variation across species, but the role of intraspecific variation in driving local and large-scale patterns is often overlooked, particularly in the field of thermal biology. In amphibians, which depend on environmental conditions and behavior to regulate body temperature, recognizing intraspecific thermal trait variation is essential to comprehensively understanding how global change impacts populations. Here, we examine the drivers of micro- and macrogeographical intraspecific thermal trait variation in amphibians. At the local scale, intraspecific variation can arise via changes in ontogeny, body size, and between the sexes, and developmental plasticity, acclimation, and maternal effects may modulate predictions of amphibian performance under future climate scenarios. At the macrogeographic scale, local adaptation in thermal traits may occur along latitudinal and elevational gradients, with seasonality and range-edge dynamics likely playing important roles in patterns that may impact future persistence. We also discuss the importance of considering disease as a factor affecting intraspecific variation in thermal traits and population resilience to climate change, given the impact of pathogens on thermal preferences and critical thermal limits of hosts. Finally, we make recommendations for future work in this area. Ultimately, our goal is to demonstrate why it is important for researchers to consider intraspecific variation to determine the resilience of amphibians to global change.

DT Article
ID FUNCTIONALS; STATE
AB The A V 3 Sb 5 ( A = K, Rb, Cs) kagome materials host an interplay of emergent phenomena including superconductivity, charge density wave states, and nontrivial electronic structure topology. The band structures of these materials exhibit a rich variety of features like Dirac crossings, saddle points associated with van Hove singularities, and flat bands prompting significant investigations into the in -plane electronic behavior. However, recent findings including the charge density wave ordering and effects due to pressure or chemical doping point to the importance of understanding interactions between kagome layers. Probing this c -axis electronic structure via experimental methods remains challenging due to limitations of the crystals and, therefore, rigorous computational approaches are necessary to study the interlayer interactions. Here we use first-principles approaches to study the electronic structure of CsV 3 Sb 5 with emphasis on the k z dispersion. We find that the inclusion of nonlocal and dynamical many-body correlation has a substantial impact on the interlayer band structure. We present band behavior that additionally supports the integration of symmetry in accurately plotting electronic structures and influences further analysis like the calculation of topological invariants.

AB Supramolecular chirality typically originates from either chiral molecular building blocks or external chiral stimuli. Generating chirality in achiral systems in the absence of a chiral input, however, is non-trivial and necessitates spontaneous mirror symmetry breaking. Achiral nematic lyotropic chromonic liquid crystals have been reported to break mirror symmetry under strong surface or geometric constraints. Here we describe a previously unrecognised mechanism for creating chiral structures by subjecting the material to a pressure-driven flow in a microfluidic cell. The chirality arises from a periodic double-twist configuration of the liquid crystal and manifests as a striking stripe pattern. We show that the mirror symmetry breaking is triggered at regions of flow-induced biaxial-splay configurations of the director field, which are unstable to small perturbations and evolve into lower energy structures. The simplicity of this unique pathway to mirror symmetry breaking can shed light on the requirements for forming macroscopic chiral structures.
   Under strong surface or geometric constraints, achiral nematic liquid crystals can form chiral structures. Using pressure driven flow, Zhang et al. show a pathway to mirror symmetry breaking that does not require such constraints and that occurs in nematic lyotropic chromonic liquid crystals.

ID TEACHING PRACTICES; IMPOSTOR SYNDROME; TEACHERS; FACULTY
AB Reflective practices in education are widely advocated for and have become important components of professional reviews. The advantages of reflective practices are many; however, the literature often focuses on the benefits to students, rather than the bene-fits for the educators themselves. Additionally, the extant literature concerning reflective practices in education is laden with conflicting terminology and complex studies, which can inhibit educators' understanding of reflective practices and prevent their adoption. As such, this Essay serves as a primer for educators beginning reflective practices. It briefly describes the benefits to educators and different classifications and modalities of reflec-tion and examines some of the challenges that educators may encounter.

AB The joining of Inconel 625 and GRCop42 using additive manufacturing is required for thermal management of high operating temperature components such as rocket combustion chambers. Though prior efforts have been made to use laser directed energy deposition to join these materials, the impact of laser power and deposition sequence on microstructure of these joints is not well understood. In this study, Inconel 625 onto GRCop42 and GRCop42 onto Inconel 625 joints are fabricated by powder directed-energy-deposition at various laser powers and subsequently subjected to characterization in terms of present defects, grain morphology, and phases. Results show lack -of -fusion free Inconel 625 onto GRCop42 joints can be fabricated by increasing the laser power in the first layer. Substrate remelting in GRCop42 onto Inconel 625 joints is found to result in a melt pool composition which induces liquid-state immiscibility, resulting in a Cu-deprived liquid solidifying to form crack prone islands. Increasing laser power decreases the embrittlement of these islands due to the precipitation of a lower volume fraction of intermetallic phases.

AB This work is devoted to studying a class of biological control problems in a stochastic environment. Specifically, it focuses on stochastic LotkaVoltera systems. Our effort is on treating average cost per unit time controlled diffusions. It is natural to use a vanishing discount argument. However, in contrast to the existing literature, neither the "near-monotone" nor the "stable" condition is satisfied in the current set up. In reference to one of our recent works, we divide the domain into two parts. In one sub-domain, the "near-monotone" condition is satisfied, whereas in the other sub-domain, the "stable" condition is satisfied. We then carefully work out the analysis in the two domains so as to obtain the desired optimal control.

AB Phosphine oxides and arsine oxides are common laboratory reagents with diverse applications that stem from the chemistry exhibited by these monomeric species. Stibine oxides are, in contrast, generally dimeric or oligomeric species because of the reactivity-quenching self-association of the highly polarized stiboryl (Sb=O/Sb+-O-) group. We recently isolated Dipp3SbO (Dipp = 2,6-diisopropylphenyl), the first example of a kinetically stabilized monomeric stibine oxide, which exists as a bench-stable solid and bears an unperturbed stiboryl group. Herein, we report the isolation of Mes(3)SbO (Mes = mesityl), in which the less bulky substituents maintain the monomeric nature of the compound but unlock access to a wider range of reactivity at the unperturbed stiboryl group relative to Dipp(3)SbO. Mes(3)SbO was found to be a potent Lewis base in the formation of adducts with the main-group Lewis acids PbMe3Cl and SnMe3Cl. The accessible Lewis acidity at the Sb atom results in a change in the reactivity with GeMe3Cl, SiMe3Cl, and CPh3Cl. With these species, Mes(3)SbO formally adds the E-Cl (E = Ge, Si, C) bond across the unsaturated stiboryl group to form a 5-coordinate stiborane. The biphilicity of Mes(3)SbO is sufficiently potent to activate even the C-F and Si-F bonds of C(p-MeOPh)(3)F and SiEt3F, respectively. These results mark a significant contribution to an increasingly rich literature on the reactivity of polar, unsaturated main-group motifs. Furthermore, these results highlight the utility of a kinetic stabilization approach to access unusual bonding motifs with unquenched reactivity that can be leveraged for small-molecule activation.

AB Understanding the often antagonistic plant-herbivore interactions and how host defenses can influence herbivore dietary breadth is an area of ongoing study in ecology and evolutionary biology. Typically, host plants/fungi that produce highly noxious chemical defenses are only fed on by specialists. We know very little about generalist species that can feed and develop on a noxious host. One such example of generalists feeding on toxic host occurs in the mushroom-feeding Drosophila found in the immigrans-tripunctata radiation. Although these species are classified as generalists, their acceptable hosts include deadly Amanita species. In this study, we used behavioral assays to assess associations between one mushroom-feeding species, Drosophila guttifera, and the deadly Amanita phalloides. We conducted feeding assays to confirm the presence of cyclopeptide toxin tolerance. We then completed host preference assays in female flies and larvae and did not find a preference for toxic mushrooms in either. Finally, we assessed the effect of competition on oviposition preference. We found that the presence of a competitor's eggs on the preferred host was associated with the flies increasing the number of eggs laid on the toxic mushrooms. Our results highlight how access to a low competition host resource may help to maintain associations between a generalist species and a highly toxic host.
   We used a variety of behavioral assays to assess the association between a generalist feeder and a highly toxic host fungus. Our results suggest that access to a resource with lower competition may help to maintain this association.image

AB This paper considered divergence-free basis methods to solve the viscous Stokes equations. A discrete divergence-free subspace was constructed to reduce the saddle point problem of the Stokes problem to a smaller-sized symmetric and positive definite system solely depending on the velocity components. Then, the system could decouple the unknowns in velocity and pressure and solve them independently. However, such a scheme may not ensure an accurate numerical solution to the velocity. In order to obtain satisfactory accuracy, we used a velocity reconstruction technique to enhance the divergence-free scheme to achieve the desired pressure and viscosity robustness. Numerical results were presented to demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of this discrete divergence-free method.

AB This work is devoted to studying a class of biological control problems in a stochastic environment. Specifically, it focuses on stochastic LotkaVoltera systems. Our effort is on treating average cost per unit time controlled diffusions. It is natural to use a vanishing discount argument. However, in contrast to the existing literature, neither the "near-monotone" nor the "stable" condition is satisfied in the current set up. In reference to one of our recent works, we divide the domain into two parts. In one sub-domain, the "near-monotone" condition is satisfied, whereas in the other sub-domain, the "stable" condition is satisfied. We then carefully work out the analysis in the two domains so as to obtain the desired optimal control.

AB In vehicle edge computing network (VECN), a key issue for the roadside unit (RSU) is how to handle computationally intensive tasks timely and use energy efficiently. When an RSU cannot finish the task on time, computation offloading will be an effective approach. However, when offloading tasks most RSUs neglect the energy supply and do not consider computation requirement and energy supply jointly. In this paper, we consider a VECN where there are multiple RSUs. When an RSU has a computational task with latency constraint, it will offload the task to the nearby RSUs and/or cloud servers, and purchase electricity from the neighbors and/or power grid if it is also short of power. To conserve energy and reduce cost, not only the collaboration between the VECN and the cloud/grid, but also the collaboration of RSUs within the VECN is investigated. Specifically, we first formulate the information-energy collaboration problem, and study how the strategies of computation offloading and energy sharing interact with each other, where the RSU's individual revenue is considered. Next, since the problem is a mixed nonlinear programming problem that is hard to be solved, we reformulate it into a double-level coalition formation game, based on which an algorithm with low complexity is proposed. Finally, we prove theoretically that through finite iterations, the game-based algorithm can converge to a stable Nash equilibrium which is the solution to the original problem. Simulation results show that our scheme is superior to the existing ones in reducing edge network expenses while improving individual revenue.

AB Recently, the technological development in edge computing and content caching can provide high-quality services for users in the wireless communication networks. As a promising technology, multi-access edge computing (MEC) can offload tasks to the nearby edge servers, which alleviates the pressure of users. However, various services and dynamic wireless channel conditions make effective resource allocation challenging. In addition, network slicing can create a logical virtual network and allocate resources flexibly among multiple tenants. In this paper, we construct an integrated architecture of communication, computing and caching to solve the joint optimization problem of task scheduling and resource allocation. In order to coordinate network functions and dynamically allocate limited resources, this paper adopts an improved deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method, which fully jointly considers the diversity of user request services and the dynamic wireless channel conditions to obtain the mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) maximal profit function. Considering the slow convergence speed of the DRL algorithm, this paper combines DRL and ensemble learning. The simulation result shows that the resource allocation scheme inspired by DRL is significantly better than the other compared strategies. The output of the result of DRL algorithm combined with ensemble learning is faster and more cost-effective.

AB While Deep Learning-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (DL-NIDS) have recently been significantly explored and shown superior performance, they are insufficient to actively respond to the detected intrusions due to the semantic gap between their detection results and actionable interpretations. Furthermore, their high error costs make network operators unwilling to respond solely based on their detection results. The root cause of these drawbacks can be traced to the lack of explainability of DL-NIDS. Although some methods have been developed to explain deep learning-based systems, they are incapable of handling the history inputs and complex feature dependencies of structured data and do not perform well in explaining DL-NIDS.
   In this paper, we present xNIDS, a novel framework that facilitates active intrusion responses by explaining DL-NIDS. Our explanation method is highlighted by: (1) approximating and sampling around history inputs; and (2) capturing feature dependencies of structured data to achieve a high-fidelity explanation. Based on the explanation results, xNIDS can further generate actionable defense rules. We evaluate xNIDS with four state-of-the-art DL-NIDS. Our evaluation results show that xNIDS outperforms previous explanation methods in terms of fidelity, sparsity, completeness, and stability, all of which are important to active intrusion responses. Moreover, we demonstrate that xNIDS can efficiently generate practical defense rules, help understand DL-NIDS behaviors, and troubleshoot detection errors.

AB Functionalized multimembered carbocyclic compounds are synthetically challenging scaffolds found in numerous pharmaceuticals and natural products. Herein, we describe a stereoselective and operationally straightforward method to form such carbocyclic compounds via a Michael addition-cyclization cascade. This method is effective in forming three or more contiguous stereocenters with high enantio- and diastereocontrol directly from alpha-substituted arylacetic acids with chiral lithium amides (CLAs) as traceless stereodirecting auxiliaries.

AB Calls to identify, explore, and address ethical and social issues as part of the design and implementation of scientific research are now widespread. One way of doing so is through an embedded approach, where ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI) researchers are situated within larger scientific research studies. We trace the emergence of the 'embedded ELSI' approach to integration alongside the development of genomic medicine. In particular, we conduct a conjunctural analysis that draws attention to contests and struggles over the forms and meanings of good science - in this case, genomics - and the role(s) of ELSI scholars and researchers in producing good science. We demonstrate that the embedded ELSI approach emerged from these contests, which left ELSI research and interventions constrained - institutionally, topically, and methodologically. We end by calling for an opening up of embedded approaches to integration so that they might better meet calls for justice and equity in the present conjuncture.

AB Premise: There is a general lack of consensus on the best practices for filtering of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and whether it is better to use SNPs or include flanking regions (full "locus") in phylogenomic analyses and subsequent comparative methods. Methods: Using genotyping-by-sequencing data from 22 Glycine species, we assessed the effects of SNP vs. locus usage and SNP retention stringency. We compared branch length, node support, and divergence time estimation across 16 datasets with varying amounts of missing data and total size. Results: Our results revealed five aspects of phylogenomic data usage that may be generally applicable: (1) tree topology is largely congruent across analyses; (2) filtering strictly for SNP retention (e.g., 90-100%) reduces support and can alter some inferred relationships; (3) absolute branch lengths vary by two orders of magnitude between SNP and locus datasets; (4) data type and branch length variation have little effect on divergence time estimation; and (5) phylograms alter the estimation of ancestral states and rates of morphological evolution. Discussion: Using SNP or locus datasets does not alter phylogenetic inference significantly, unless researchers want or need to use absolute branch lengths. We recommend against using excessive filtering thresholds for SNP retention to reduce the risk of producing inconsistent topologies and generating low support.

AB Hyperdimensional computing (HDC) is an emerging paradigm that employs hypervectors (HVs) to emulate cognitive tasks. In HDC, the most time-consuming and power-hungry process is encoding, the first step that maps raw data into HVs. There have been non-volatile memory (NVM) based computing-in-memory (CiM) HDC encoding designs, which exploit the intrinsic HDC characteristics of high parallelism, massive data, and robustness. These NVM-based CiMs have shown great potential in reducing encoding time and power consumption. Among them, the ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET) based designs show ultra-high energy efficiency. However, existing FeFET-based HDC encoding designs face the challenges of energy-consuming current-mode addition, inefficient HV storage, limited endurance, and single encoding method support. These challenges limit the energy efficiency, lifetime, and versatility of the designs.
   This work proposes an energy-efficient charge-domain FeFET-based in-memory HDC encoder, i.e., CafeHD, with extended lifetime, good versatility, and comparable accuracy. Area-efficient charge-domain computing is proposed in HDC encoding for the first time, which enables CafeHD with ultra-low power and high scalability. An HV merging technique is explored to improve the performance. A low-cost partial MAJ interface is also proposed to reduce writes. Besides, CafeHD also supports two widely used encoding methods. Results show that CafeHD on average achieves 10.9x/12.7x/3.5x speedup and 103.3x/21.9x/6.3x energy efficiency with similar to 84% write times reduction and similar accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art ReRAM/PCM/FeFET-based CiM design for HDC encoding, respectively.

AB We develop Temporal Quantile Adjustment (TQA), a general method to construct efficient and valid prediction intervals (PIs) for regression on cross-sectional time series data. Such data is common in many domains, including econometrics and healthcare. A canonical example in healthcare is predicting patient outcomes using physiological time-series data, where a population of patients composes a cross-section. Reliable PI estimators in this setting must address two distinct notions of coverage: cross-sectional coverage across a cross-sectional slice, and longitudinal coverage along the temporal dimension for each time series. Recent works have explored adapting Conformal Prediction (CP) to obtain PIs in the time series context. However, none handles both notions of coverage simultaneously. CP methods typically query a pre-specified quantile from the distribution of non-conformity scores on a calibration set. TQA adjusts the quantile to query in CP at each time t, accounting for both cross-sectional and longitudinal coverage in a theoretically-grounded manner. The post-hoc nature of TQA facilitates its use as a general wrapper around any time series regression model. We validate TQA's performance through extensive experimentation: TQA generally obtains efficient PIs and improves longitudinal coverage while preserving cross-sectional coverage. Our code is available at https://github.com/zlin7/TQA.

AB Learning time-evolving objects such as multivariate time series and dynamic networks requires the development of novel knowledge representation mechanisms and neural network architectures, which allow for capturing implicit time-dependent information contained in the data. Such information is typically not directly observed but plays a key role in the learning task performance. In turn, lack of time dimension in knowledge encoding mechanisms for time-dependent data leads to frequent model updates, poor learning performance, and, as a result, subpar decision-making. Here we propose a new approach to a time-aware knowledge representation mechanism that notably focuses on implicit timedependent topological information along multiple geometric dimensions. In particular, we propose a new approach, named Temporal MultiPersistence (TMP), which produces multidimensional topological fingerprints of the data by using the existing single parameter topological summaries. The main idea behind TMP is to merge the two newest directions in topological representation learning, that is, multi-persistence which simultaneously describes data shape evolution along multiple key parameters, and zigzag persistence to enable us to extract the most salient data shape information over time. We derive theoretical guarantees of TMP vectorizations and show its utility, in application to forecasting on benchmark traffic flow, Ethereum blockchain, and electrocardiogram datasets, demonstrating the competitive performance, especially, in scenarios of limited data records. In addition, our TMP method improves the computational efficiency of the state-of-the-art multipersistence summaries up to 59.5 times.

AB The species - area relationship (SAR) is a common pattern in which diversity increases with the area sampled, but ecosystems are three-dimensional (3D) and diversity - volume relationships (DVRs) may exist in ecosystems that vary substantially in their vegetation volume. We tested whether forest vegetation volume, as a 3D extension of area in SARs, was a significant predictor of taxonomic (species) and structural (arrangement) diversity in five groups of organisms across the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON). Vegetation volume and four structural arrangement metrics within the area of NEON plots were measured using NEON's discrete return lidar. Species richness was measured as the number of species within the respective NEON plot sampling area for understory plants, trees, breeding land birds, small mammals, and ground beetles. We found that volume negatively predicted understory plants and positively predicted tree and beetle species richness across the USA forest macrosystem, but not bird and small mammal species richness. Furthermore, volume was a significant predictor of several metrics that describe the internal and external heterogeneity of vegetation in forests (structural arrangement) within the ecosystem across the USA forest macrosystem. There were several significant within site-level relationships, but not at all sites, between volume and species richness or structural arrangement in organism groups. Our study indicates that previous work that has focused on a 2D conceptualization of habitat can be expanded to 3D habitat space, but that the strength and the positive or negative direction of DVRs may vary taxonomically or geographically.

AB The yields of stabilized Criegee intermediates (sCIs), CH2OO and RCHOO (C2H5CHOO, C3H7CHOO, C4H9CHOO, and C5H11CHOO), produced from ozonolysis of asymmetrical 1-alkenes (1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, and 1-heptene) were investigated at low pressures (5-16 Torr) using cavity ring-down spectroscopy and chemical titration with sulfur dioxide (SO2). By extrapolating the low-pressure measurements to zero-pressure limit, nascent sCI yields were obtained. Combined with our previous studies on ethene and propene ozonolysis, the nascent sCI yields demonstrated an intriguing trend of increasing with the addition of CH2 groups and eventually reached a plateau at around 31% for longer chain 1-alkenes. In particular, the fraction of nascent stabilized CH2OO reached the plateau from 1-butene, indicating that CH2OO was produced with nearly the same internal energy distribution from 1-butene to 1-heptene. The comparison between the experiments and RRKM calculations suggests that the dissociation of primary ozonide (POZ) of O-3 + ethene and propene can be treated by statistical theory, while that of O-3 + 1-butene to 1-heptene is nonstatistical and intramolecular vibrational redistribution of the initial energy on the 1,2,3-trioxolane of POZ throughout the entire molecule was incomplete on the dissociation time scale.<br />

AB Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) can retain intact protein structures, but details about partially folded and unfolded protein structures during and after introduction to the gas phase are elusive. Here we use ESI-MS with chemical cross-linkers to compare denatured cytochrome c structures in both solution and gas phases. Solution phase cross-linking prior to ESI captures solution phase structures, while gas phase cross-linking through ion/ion reactions in the trap cell captures gas phase structures. Comparing the ECD fragmentation of the cross-linked products under both conditions shows very similar cross-linker identifications, alluding to no major structural dissimilarities between solution and gas structures. Molecular modeling of the denatured protein using the identified cross-linked sites as distant restraints allows for visualization of the denatured structures to pinpoint where unfolding begins. Our data suggest that cytochrome c likely begins to unfold due to interior hydrophobic expansion, followed by alpha helical unfolding. This localization of structural changes is more specific than using CCS measurements alone.

AB With the rapid progress in Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF), researchers have studied how MAPF algorithms can be deployed to coordinate hundreds of robots in large automated warehouses. While most works try to improve the throughput of such warehouses by developing better MAPF algorithms, we focus on improving the throughput by optimizing the warehouse layout. We show that, even with state-of-the-art MAPF algorithms, commonly used human-designed layouts can lead to congestion for warehouses with large numbers of robots and thus have limited scalability. We extend existing automatic scenario generation methods to optimize warehouse layouts. Results show that our optimized warehouse layouts (1) reduce traffic congestion and thus improve throughput, (2) improve the scalability of the automated warehouses by doubling the number of robots in some cases, and (3) are capable of generating layouts with user-specified diversity measures.

AB Structural health monitoring (SHM) systems are critical in ensuring the safety of space exploration, as spacecraft and structures can experience detrimental stresses and strains. By deploying conventional strain gauges, SHM systems can promptly detect and assess localized strain behaviors in structures; however, these strain gauges are limited by low sensitivity (gauge factor, GF similar to 2). This study introduces an approach to printing strain gauges with high sensitivity, while also considering stretchability and long-term durability. Through direct ink writing (DIW), these devices can be produced by the extrusion of a wide range of viscoelastic inks. The viscoelastic properties of the ink can be tuned with the help of additives to aid in the processing for a desired application. In this work, a series of inks were prepared from commercially available CB028 (silver ink used in screen printing) by adding a combination of ethyl cellulose (EC) and polyolefin (PO) (additives). With the goal of optimizing the long-term sensing response of the printed strain gauges, a systematic study of the rheological properties (frequency sweep analyses, yield stress, viscoelastic recovery, viscosity measurements, and tack tests) was conducted. A viscoelastic window approach was used to predict the optimal properties of the formulated inks. Using this approach, it was determined that 90% CB028, 5% EC, and 5% PO provided enhanced elastic properties, adhesion, and peel strength compared to commercial CB028. The formulated ink has enhanced tack (129 mN/mm2) and peel strength (23.3 kJ/mm2), which led to a viscoelastic window ideal for direct ink writing of the strain gauges. Printed structures were tested in a three-point bending configuration to record the piezoresistive responses that were correlated to the formulated rheological properties and underlying microstructure. The results revealed gauge factors as high as 106 with stable sensing responses for more than 300 cycles of strain. Scanning electron microscopy analysis also revealed minimal crack formation, which resulted in a stable response. The research demonstrated the feasibility of developing high-performance inks for potential printed strain gauge applications.

AB The rapid development of light-activated organic photoredox catalysts has led to the proliferation of powerful synthetic chemical strategies with industrial and pharmaceutical applications. Despite the advancement in synthetic approaches, a detailed understanding of the mechanisms governing these reactions has lagged. Time-resolved optical spectroscopy provides a method to track organic photoredox catalysis processes and reveal the energy pathways that drive reaction mechanisms. These measurements are sensitive to key processes in organic photoredox catalysis such as charge or energy transfer, lifetimes of singlet or triplet states, and solvation dynamics. The sensitivity and specificity of ultrafast spectroscopic measurements can provide a new perspective on the mechanisms of these reactions, including electron-transfer events, the role of solvent, and the short lifetimes of radical intermediates.

AB The use of flavins and flavoproteins in photocatalytic, sensing, and biotechnological applications has led to a growing interest in computationally modeling the excited-state electronic structure and photophysics of flavin. However, there is limited consensus regarding which computational methods are appropriate for modeling flavin's photophysics. We compare the energies of low-lying excited states of flavin computed with time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT), equation-of-motion coupled cluster (EOM-EE-CCSD), scaled opposite-spin configuration interaction [SOS-CIS(D)], multiconfiguration pair-density functional theory (MC-PDFT), and several multireference perturbation theory (MR-PT2) methods. In the first part, we focus on excitation energies of the first singlet excited state (S-1) of five different redox and protonation states of flavin, with the goal of finding a suitable active space for MR-PT2 calculations. In the second part, we construct two sets of one-dimensional potential energy surfaces connecting the S-0 and S-1 equilibrium geometries (S-0-S-1 path) and the S-1 (pi,pi*) and S-2 (n,pi*) equilibrium geometries (S-1-S-2 path). The first path therefore follows a Franck-Condon active mode of flavin while the second path maps crossings points between low-lying singlet and triplet states in flavin. We discuss the similarities and differences in the TD-DFT, EOM-EE-CCSD, SOS-CIS(D), MC-PDFT and MR-PT2 energy profiles along these paths. We find that (TD-)DFT methods are suitable for applications such as simulating the spectra of flavins but are inconsistent with several other methods when used for some geometry optimizations and when describing the energetics of dark (n,pi*) states. MR-PT2 methods show promise for the simulation of flavin's low-lying excited states, but the selection of orbitals for the active space and the number of roots used for state averaging must be done carefully to avoid artifacts. Some properties, such as the intersystem crossing geometry and energy between the S-1 (pi,pi*) and T-2 (n,pi*) states, may require additional benchmarking before they can be determined quantitatively.

AB In classical theory, heat conduction in solids is regarded as a diffusion process driven by a temperature gradient, whereas fluid transport is understood as convection process involving the bulk motion of the liquid or gas. In the framework of ab initio theory, which is directly built upon quantum mechanics without relying on measured parameters or phenomenological models, we observed and investigated the fluid-like convective transport of energy carriers in solid heat conduction. Thermal transport, carried by phonons, is simulated in graphite by solving the Boltzmann transport equation using a Monte Carlo algorithm. To capture convective transport, with phonon distributions deviating significantly from equilibrium Bose-Einstein distribution, we determined phonon interactions using ab initio approaches that go beyond relaxation time approximations. The presence of strong momentum-conserved Normal scatterings in graphite introduces a regime for hydrodynamic phonon transport. Fluid-like features, such as vortex and jet flow, are visualized and compared with classical theories on heat diffusion and fluid convection. Our study on phonon convection enhances fundamental understandings of heat conduction in solids from both atomic scale and quantum aspects, innovating thermal designs for future microelectronic devices and other thermal management applications. This potentially offers solutions for heat dissipation challenges in the post-Moore era.

AB High-quality mesh generation is the foundation of accurate finite element analysis. Due to the vast interior vertices search space and complex initial boundaries, mesh generation for complicated domains requires substantial manual processing and has long been considered the most challenging and time-consuming bottleneck of the entire modeling and analysis process. In this paper, we present a novel computational framework named "SRL-assisted AFM"for meshing planar geometries by combining the advancing front method with neural networks that select reference vertices and update the front boundary using "policy networks". These deep neural networks are trained using a unique pipeline that combines supervised learning with reinforcement learning to iteratively improve mesh quality. First, we generate different initial boundaries by randomly sampling points in a square domain and connecting them sequentially. These boundaries are used for obtaining input meshes and extracting training datasets in the supervised learning module. We then iteratively improve the reinforcement learning model performance with reward functions designed for special requirements, such as improving the mesh quality and controlling the number and distribution of extraordinary points. Our proposed supervised learning neural networks achieve an accuracy higher than 98% on predicting commercial software. The final reinforcement learning neural networks automatically generate high-quality quadrilateral meshes for complex planar domains with sharp features and boundary layers.

AB Seasonal migration is a widespread behavior relevant for adaptation and speciation, yet knowledge of its genetic basis is limited. We leveraged advances in tracking and sequencing technologies to bridge this gap in a well - characterized hybrid zone between songbirds that differ in migratory behavior. Migration requires the coordinated action of many traits, including orientation, timing, and wing morphology. We used genetic mapping to show these traits are highly heritable and genetically correlated, explaining how migration has evolved so rapidly in the past and suggesting future responses to climate change may be possible. Many of these traits mapped to the same genomic regions and small structural variants indicating the same, or tightly linked, genes underlie them. Analyses integrating transcriptomic data indicate cholinergic receptors could control multiple traits. Furthermore, analyses integrating genomic differentiation further suggested genes underlying migratory traits help maintain reproductive isolation in this hybrid zone.

AB Precise fundamental atmospheric stellar parameters and abundance determination of individual elements in stars are important for all stellar population studies. Non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE; hereafter NLTE) models are often important for such high precision, however, can be computationally complex and expensive, which renders the models less utilized in spectroscopic analyses. To alleviate the computational burden of such models, we developed a robust 1D, NLTE fundamental atmospheric stellar parameter derivation tool, LOTUS, to determine the effective temperature T-eff, surface gravity logg, metallicity [Fe/H], and microturbulent velocity v(mic) for FGK-type stars, from equivalent width (EW) measurements of FeI and Fe II lines. We utilize a generalized curve of growth method to take into account the EW dependencies of each FeI and Fe II line on the corresponding atmospheric stellar parameters. A global differential evolution optimization algorithm is then used to derive the fundamental parameters. Additionally, LOTUS can determine precise uncertainties for each stellar parameter using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We test and apply LOTUS on a sample of benchmark stars, as well as stars with available asteroseismic surface gravities from the K2 survey, and metal-poor stars from the Gaia-ESO and R -Process Alliance surveys. We find very good agreement between our NLTE-derived parameters in LOTUS to nonspectroscopic values on average within T-eff = +/- 30 K, and logg = +/- 0.10 dex for benchmark stars. We provide open access of our code, as well as of the interpolated precomputed NLTE EW grids available on Github (the software is available on GitHub(3) under an MIT License, and version 0.1.1 (as the persistent version) is archived in Zenodo) and documentation with working examples on the Readthedocs book.

AB Noise in quantum computers presents a challenge for the users of quantum computing despite the rapid progress we have seen in the past few years in building quantum computers. Existing works have addressed the noise in quantum computers using a variety of mitigation techniques since error correction requires a large number of qubits which is infeasible at present. One of the consequences of quantum computing noise is that users are unable to reproduce similar output from the same quantum computer at different times, let alone from various quantum computers. In this work, we have made initial attempts to visualize quantum basis states for all the circuits that were used in quantum machine learning from various quantum computers and noise-free quantum simulators. We have opened up a pathway for further research into this field where we will be able to isolate noisy states from non-noisy states leading to efficient error mitigation. This is where our work provides an important step in the direction of efficient error mitigation. Our work also provides a ground for quantum noise visualization in the case of large numbers of qubits.

AB This work focuses on optimal harvesting-renewing for a stochastic population. A mixed regular-singular control formulation with a state constraint and regime switching is introduced. The decision-makers either harvest or renew with finite or infinite harvesting/renewing rates. The payoff functions depend on the harvesting/renewing rates. Several properties of the value function are established. The limiting value function as the white noise intensity approaches infinity is identified. The Markov chain approximation method is used to find numerical approximation of the value function and optimal strategies.

AB Lyman aemitters (LAEs) are excellent probes of the reionization process, as they must be surrounded by large ionized bubbles in order to be visible during the reionization era. Large ionized regions are thought to correspond to overdense regions and may be protoclusters, making them interesting test-beds for early massive structures. Close associations containing several LAEs are often assumed to mark overdense, ionized bubbles. Here, we develop the first framework to quantify the ionization and density fields of high-z galaxy associations. We explore the interplay between (i) the large-scale density of a survey field, (ii) Poisson noise due to the small number density of bright sources at high redshifts (z similar to 7), and (iii) the effects of the ionized fraction on the observation of LAEs. We use Bayesian statistics, a simple model of reionization, and a Monte Carlo simulation to construct a more comprehensive method for calculating the large-scale density of LAE regions than previous works. We find that Poisson noise has a strong effect on the inferred density of a region and show how the ionized fraction can be inferred. We then apply our framework to the strongest association yet identified: Hu et al. found 14 LAEs in a volume of similar to 50 000 cMpc(3) inside the COSMOS field at z similar to 7. We show that this is most likely a 2.4 sigma overdensity inside of an ionized or nearly ionized bubble. We also show that this LAE association implies that the global ionized fraction is (Q) over bar = 0.59(-0.11)(+0.10), within the context of a simple reionization model.

AB This work develops a novel class of numerical approximation algorithms for highly nonlinear stochastic differential equations. It is inspired by a stochastic approximation/optimization algorithm. The idea is the generation of random-varying truncation bounds. The algorithms are suited in case the coefficients have faster than linear growth resulting in the finite explosion time in implementing the usual Euler-Maruyama scheme, and are easier to be implemented in contrast to the existing approaches. In this paper, weak convergence and weak convergence rates of the algorithms are established using the martingale problem formulation. Some numerical examples are presented for demonstration. Finally, remarks on algorithms with additional random switching and algorithms with decreasing step sizes are given.

AB BackgroundWhile laboratory practices have traditionally been conducted in-person, online asynchronous laboratory learning has been growing in popularity due to increased enrollments and the recent pandemic, creating opportunities for accessibility. In remote asynchronous learning environments, students have more autonomy to choose how they participate with other students in their laboratory classes. Communities of practice and self-efficacy may provide insights into why students are making their participation choices and how they are interacting with peers in asynchronous physics laboratory courses.ResultsIn this mixed methods, explanatory sequential study, students in an introductory physics remote asynchronous laboratory (N = 272) were surveyed about their social learning perceptions and their physics laboratory self-efficacy. Three groups of students were identified based upon their self-reported participation level of communication with peers in asynchronous courses: (1) contributors, who communicated with peers via instant messaging software and posted comments; (2) lurkers, who read discussions on instant messaging software without posting comments; and (3) outsiders, who neither read nor posted comments to peer discussions. Analysis of variance with post hoc Tukey tests showed significant differences in social learning perceptions among contributors, lurkers, and outsiders, with a large effect size, and differences between contributing and lurking students' self-efficacy, with a small effect size. Qualitative findings from open-ended survey responses indicated contributors felt the structure of the learning environment, or their feeling of connectedness with other students, facilitated their desire to contribute. Many lurkers felt they could get what they needed through vicarious learning, and many expressed their lack of confidence to post relevant, accurate comments. Outsiders felt they did not have to, did not want to, or could not connect with other students.ConclusionsWhile the classroom laboratory traditionally requires all students to participate in the learning process through active socialization with other students, students in a remote asynchronous laboratory may still gain the benefits of participation through lurking. Instructors may consider lurking in an online or remote science laboratory as a legitimate form of participation and engagement.

AB With the growing recognition that conventional agriculture will not be able to meet food production demands, innovative strategies to reach food security are imperative. Although nanoscale fertilizers are attracting increased attention as a sustainable platform for agricultural applications, limited data exist on how surface charge influences overall efficacy relative to disease suppression and nutrient accumulation. This study investigated the effect of positively and negatively charged iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe3O4 NPs) on the growth of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) plants and their disease resistance against the pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici at both the greenhouse and field scale. In addition, a theoretical model of the biointerface was employed for a mechanistic understanding of the interaction and attachment efficiency between NPs and tomato leaves after foliar exposure. In the greenhouse, both positively and negatively charged Fe3O4 NPs significantly suppressed Fusarium wilt by 41.4 and 44.6% and increased plant shoot biomass by 327.6 and 455.0%, respectively, compared to the diseased control. The impact of the NP surface charge was apparent; positively charged Fe3O4 NPs demonstrated superior efficacy compared to their negatively charged counterparts in mitigating disease damage and regulating nutrient (Na, Si, and Cu) accumulation. Computationally, positively charged Fe3O4 NPs consistently migrate toward lipid layers, indicative of a pronounced affinity between these entities compared with the negatively charged particles, which aligns with the experimental data. The findings highlight the importance and tunability of nanomaterials properties, especially the surface charge, in optimizing the use for disease suppression and nutrient modulation, which offers a great potential for sustainable agriculture.

AB To achieve a green heterogeneous 5G network, a promising approach is to shut off the light-loaded low-power nodes (LPNs) and transfer the load to the remote radio heads (RRHs) nearby. However, the RRHs may refuse to cooperate when there is no incentive. Considering a user will stay in an RRH for a period of time, how to provide proper long-term incentives for the potential RRHs and select the best one is an essential issue. Since the offloading capability of an RRH is private information, that is, unavailable to the LPNs, in this article, the RRHs' collaboration incentive problem under such asymmetric information condition is modeled as a long-term contract design problem. In the formulated problem, the channel condition and traffic load, which represent both RRH's instantaneous state and long-term state, are combined to capture the RRHs' offloading capacity and used to classify their types. Due to the dynamic of state, an RRH's type varies with time, which greatly complicates the contract design. We first study the state transition of RRHs and the long-term utilities of both parties, with which the contract-theoretic framework is formulated. Then, we theoretically analyze and simplify the individual rational and incentive-compatible constraints for a feasible long-term contract. Finally, we propose a low time complexity algorithm to find the optimal contract. Numerical results verify that the long-term contract-based incentive mechanism not only improves the utilities of both cooperation parties, but also is superior to the existing works in reducing handover cost and energy consumption.

TI Machine learning detection of Majorana zero modes from zero-bias peak

ID BOUND-STATE; SUPERCONDUCTOR; FERMIONS; ANYONS
AB Majorana zero modes (MZMs) carry non-Abelian statistics and great promise for topological quantum computation. A key signature of MZMs is the zero-bias peaks (ZBPs) in tunneling differential conductance. However, identifying MZMs from ZBPs has been challenging due to topological trivial states generating spurious signals. In this work, we introduce a machine learning framework that can distinguish MZM from other signals using ZBP data. Quantum transport simulation from tight-binding models is used to generate training data, while persistent cohomology analysis confirms the feasibility of machinebased classification. Even with noisy data, the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) classifier reaches 85% accuracy for 1D data and 94% for 2D data with Zeeman splitting. Tests on prior experiments show that key observations from some of the prior experiments are more likely to originate from MZMs. Our model offers a quantitative approach to assess MZMs using solely ZBP data. Furthermore, our results highlight the use of machine learning on exotic quantum systems with experimental-computational integration.

AB The scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) for retrieval-based tasks, particularly in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), faces significant memory constraints, especially when fine-tuning extensive prompt sequences. Current open-source libraries support full-model inference and fine-tuning across multiple GPUs but fall short of accommodating the efficient parameter distribution required for retrieved context. Addressing this gap, we introduce a novel framework for PEFT-compatible fine-tuning of GPT models, leveraging distributed training. Our framework uniquely utilizes JAX's just-in-time (JIT) compilation and tensor-sharding for efficient resource management, thereby enabling accelerated fine-tuning with reduced memory requirements. This advancement significantly improves the scalability and feasibility of fine-tuning LLMs for complex RAG applications, even on systems with limited GPU resources. Our experiments show more than 12x improvement in runtime compared to Hugging Face/DeepSpeed implementation with four GPUs while consuming less than half the VRAM per GPU.

AB Over the last three decades, photometric galaxy selection using the Lyman-break technique has transformed our understanding of the high-z Universe, pro viding large samples of galaxies at 3 less than or similar to z less than or similar to 8 with relatively small contamination. With the advent of the JWST, the Lyman-break technique has now been extended to z similar to 17. However, the purity of the resulting samples has not been tested. Here, we use a simple model, built on the robust foundation of the dark matter halo mass function, to show that the expected lev el of contamination rises dramatically at z greater than or similar to 10, especially for luminous galaxies, placing stringent requirements on the selection process. The most luminous sources at z greater than or similar to 12 are likely at least 10 000 times rarer than potential contaminants, so extensive spectroscopic follow-up campaigns may be required to identify a small number of target sources.

AB An ultra-thin overcoating of zirconium oxide (ZrO2) film on CuO-ZnO-Al2O3 (CZA) catalysts by atomic layer deposition (ALD) was proved to enhance the catalytic performance of CZA/HZSM-5 (H form of Zeolite Socony Mobil-5) bifunctional catalysts for hydrogenation of CO2 to dimethyl ether (DME). Under optimal reaction conditions (i.e. 240 degrees C and 2.8 MPa), the yield of product DME increased from 17.22% for the bare CZA/HZSM-5 catalysts, to 18.40% for the CZA catalyst after 5 cycles of ZrO2 ALD with HZSM-5 catalyst. All the catalysts modified by ZrO2 ALD displayed significantly improved catalytic stability of hydrogenation of CO2 to DME reaction, compared to that of CZA/HZSM-5 bifunctional catalysts. The loss of DME yield in 100 h of reaction was greatly mitigated from 6.20% (loss of absolute value) to 3.01% for the CZA catalyst with 20 cycles of ZrO2 ALD overcoating. Characterizations including hydrogen temperature programmed reduction, x-ray powder diffraction, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that there was strong interaction between Cu active centers and ZrO2.

AB Resource sharing is fundamental to the design of telecommunication networks. The technology, economic and policy forces shaping the transition to next-generation digital networking infrastructure-characterized here as "5G+" (for 5G and beyond)-make new and evolved forms of edge sharing a necessity. Despite this necessity, most of the economic and policy research on Network Sharing Agreements (NSAs) has focused on sharing among service providers offering retail services via networks owned and operated by legacy fixed and mobile network operators (MNOs). In this essay, we make the case for why increased and more dynamic options for sharing, in particular of end-user owned network infrastructure, should be embraced for the future of NSAs. Furthermore, we explain how such a novel sharing paradigm must be matched by appropriate regulatory policies.

AB Numerical models for the growth of garnet are presented to evaluate the relative significance of reaction-limited growth and diffusion-limited growth following garnet nucleation after significant overstepping of the equilibrium garnet-in reaction. Reactions are only permitted among phases that are adjacent across grain boundaries and the extent of reaction at a given reaction site is scaled to the local amount of chemical affinity available to the two or three reactant phases relative to the grain boundary composition. This local affinity is dissipated as the local reaction proceeds, which changes the composition of the adjacent grain boundary "phase" and sets up chemical gradients that drive diffusion along the grain boundaries. Reactions proceed until all affinity is exhausted at which point the rock is essentially at equilibrium. Two extremes are modeled. Reaction-limited growth is modeled as infinitely rapid grain boundary diffusion whereas diffusion-limited growth is modeled by assuming that reactions proceed infinitely fast such that the supply of nutrients and removal of waste products from a reaction site is restricted by the rate of diffusion. Models are presented with model assemblages chlorite + quartz + garnet and chlorite + quartz + muscovite + biotite + plagioclase + garnet. Reaction-limited models result in garnets displaying well-formed "bell-shaped" Mn zoning profiles with all garnet crystals showing similar amounts of growth and zoning profiles. Diffusion-limited models result in mineral growth or consumption that is texture-sensitive such that the amount of consumption or production of a phase depends on the location of the crystal in the sample and the proximity of other phases. For example, the total amount of garnet continues to increase for the duration of diffusion-limited models although locally an individual garnet crystal may first grow and then be consumed. Mn zoning in models with short diffusion times display distinct "peaks" in the central garnet cores, in contrast to the bell-shaped profiles in reaction-limited models. With increasing diffusion times, these Mn zoning profiles evolve towards bell-shapes. These models demonstrate that diffusion-limited growth of garnet porphyroblasts may result in textural and compositional complexities that are not encapsulated by bulk-rock thermodynamic modeling.

TI Solid-Phase Synthesis of Well-Defined Multiblock Copolymers by Atom
   Transfer Radical Polymerization
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
ID AUTOMATED SYNTHESIS; POLYMERS; CATALYSIS; RESINS
AB Solid-phase polymer synthesis, historically rooted in peptide synthesis, has evolved into a powerful method for achieving sequence-controlled macromolecules. This study explores solid-phase polymer synthesis by covalently immobilizing growing polymer chains onto a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-based resin, known as ChemMatrix (CM) resin. In contrast to traditional hydrophobic supports, CM resin's amphiphilic properties enable swelling in both polar and nonpolar solvents, simplifying filtration, washing, and drying processes. Combining atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) with solid-phase techniques allowed for the grafting of well-defined block copolymers in high yields. This approach is attractive for sequence-controlled polymer synthesis, successfully synthesizing di-, tri-, tetra-, and penta-block copolymers with excellent control over the molecular weight and dispersity. The study also delves into the limitations of achieving high molecular weights due to confinement within resin pores. Moreover, the versatility of the method is demonstrated through its applicability to various monomers in organic and aqueous media. This straightforward approach offers a rapid route to developing tailored block copolymers with unique structures and functionalities.

TI National-Scale Flood Hazard Data Unfit for Urban Risk Management
SO EARTHS FUTURE
LA English
DT Article
DE flood risk; exposure; urban flooding; social inequalities; hydrodynamic
   modeling; climate adaptation
AB Extreme flooding events are becoming more frequent and costly, and impacts have been concentrated in cities where exposure and vulnerability are both heightened. To manage risks, governments, the private sector, and households now rely on flood hazard data from national-scale models that lack accuracy in urban areas due to unresolved drainage processes and infrastructure. Here we assess the uncertainties of First Street Foundation (FSF) flood hazard data, available across the U.S., using a new model (PRIMo-Drain) that resolves drainage infrastructure and fine resolution drainage dynamics. Using the case of Los Angeles, California, we find that FSF and PRIMo-Drain estimates of population and property value exposed to 1%- and 5%-annual-chance hazards diverge at finer scales of governance, for example, by 4- to 18-fold at the municipal scale. FSF and PRIMo-Drain data often predict opposite patterns of exposure inequality across social groups (e.g., Black, White, Disadvantaged). Further, at the county scale, we compute a Model Agreement Index of only 24%-a similar to 1 in 4 chance of models agreeing upon which properties are at risk. Collectively, these differences point to limited capacity of FSF data to confidently assess which municipalities, social groups, and individual properties are at risk of flooding within urban areas. These results caution that national-scale model data at present may misinform urban flood risk strategies and lead to maladaptation, underscoring the importance of refined and validated urban models.
   Flooding presents a significant risk to human activities and development, and its impacts have been rapidly increasing over recent decades. However, government flood mapping in the U.S. has not kept pace with adaptation needs, and communities have now turned to other sources of information to inform planning and design decisions. This study examines the uncertainties of flood hazard data available from the First Street Foundation across Los Angeles, California, the second largest city in the U.S. With a comparision to two different models that more fully capture processes known to affect urban flooding, we show concerning levels of uncertainty in the First Street Foundation data at scales of municipalities and properties. These results highlight the need for more robust validation of urban flood hazard models, and caution against overliance of First Street Foundation data for urban flood management.
   Flood risks are concentrated in urban areas, where national-scale hazard models are less accurate Flood exposure estimates become increasingly uncertain at finer scales and may misrepresent the social distribution of risk Refined and validated urban flood models are needed to effectively and equitably manage increasingly severe flood risks

AB Businesses are the driving force behind economic systems and are the lifeblood of the community. A business shares striking similarity to a living organism, including birth, infancy, rising, prosperity, and falling. The success of a business is not only important to the owners, but is also critical to the regional/domestic economic system, or even the global economy. Recent years have witnessed many new emerging businesses with tremendous success, such as Google, Apple, Facebook etc., yet millions of businesses also fail or fade out within a rather short period of time. Finding patterns/factors connected to the business rise and fall remains a long lasting question puzzling many economists, entrepreneurs, and government officials. Recent advancement in artificial intelligence, especially machine learning, has lend researchers powers to use data to model and predict business success. However, due to data driven nature of all machine learning methods, existing approaches are rather domain-driven and ad-hoc in their design and validations. In this paper, we propose a systematic review of modeling and prediction of business success. We first outline a triangle framework to showcase three parities connected to the business: Investment-Business-Market (IBM). After that, we align features into three main categories, each of which is focused on modeling a business from a particular perspective, such as sales, management, innovation etc., and further summarize different types of machine learning and deep learning methods for business modeling and prediction. The survey provides a comprehensive review of computational approaches for business performance modeling and prediction.

AB High-frequency power converters are gaining increasing attention and popularity due to the high power density and high efficiency demand in electric vehicles (EVs). In this condition, high-frequency current sensing accuracy is essential. However, existing current sensing methods cannot meet the needs in terms of low power loss, small size, being contactless, or large bandwidth. This article proposes a new current sensing technique with bandwidth enhancement. First, a skin effect model for commonly used rectangular conductors is investigated. Then, variations of out-of-plane and in-plane magnetic fields caused by skin effects are analyzed theoretically. It reveals that measuring out-of-plane magnetic fields shows a larger bandwidth than measuring in-plane magnetic fields. Subsequently, a circle trace for current sensing is proposed. The corresponding simulation results illustrate necessary considerations in a circle trace-based printed circuit board (PCB) design. Then, the current responses of a proposed circle trace and a conventional straight trace are compared in experiments. In experiments, the step current response has an average improvement of 48%, and the measurement bandwidth is extended from 10 to 200 kHz using the circle trace method. These experimental results confirm that the circle trace shows better performances. Thus, the proposed method is validated for application in high-frequency current sensing.

AB Aliphatic polycarbonates (APCs) are promising biocompatible and degradable polymers with immense potential for biomedical applications. However, current synthetic approaches to stimuli-responsive APCs remain limited and often complicated, requiring multiple-step postpolymerization reactions. To address these limitations and unlock the full potential of APCs in the development of advanced biomaterials, we developed a rapid and versatile strategy to synthesize glutathione (GSH)-responsive polycarbonates through the controlled ring-opening polymerization of cyclic carbonates with activated disulfides. Responsive pendant moieties could be easily introduced in one step through a highly efficient thiol-disulfide exchange reaction enabled by the reactive pyridyl disulfides, providing a simple and versatile approach to fine-tuning polymer's physiochemical properties for biomedical applications. As a proof of concept, we prepared an amphiphilic GSH-responsive polycarbonate-drug conjugate by initiating the activated cyclic carbonate monomer with methyl polyethylene glycol and then conjugating the anticancer drug mertansine via the thiol-disulfide exchange reaction. The self-assembled nanoparticles were a smart drug delivery system with GSH-triggered drug release specifically within cancer cells and a remarkable selective toxicity toward cancer cells over healthy cells, showcasing the exceptional promise of this GSH-responsive polycarbonate for biomedical applications.

AB Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) is an important commodity polymer having a wide range of applications. Currently, only about 10% of PMMA is recycled. Herein, a simple two-stage process for the chemical upcycling of PMMA is discussed. In this method PMMA is modified by transesterification with a bio-derived, olefin-bearing terpenoid, geraniol. In the second stage, olefin-derivatized PMMA is reacted with sulfur to form a network composite by an inverse vulcanization mechanism. Inverse vulcanization of PGMA with elemental sulfur (90 wt.%) yielded the durable composite PGMA-S. This composite was characterized by NMR spectrometry, IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, thermogravimetric analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry. Composite water uptake, compressional strength analysis, flexural strength analysis, tensile strength analysis, and thermal recyclability are presented with comparison to current commercial structural materials. PGMA-S exhibits a similar compressive strength (17.5 MPa) to that of Portland cement. PGMA-S demonstrates an impressive flexural strength of 4.76 MPa which exceeds the flexural strength (>3 MPa) of many commercial ordinary Portland cements. This study provides a way to upcycle waste PMMA through combination with a naturally-occurring olefin and industrial waste sulfur to yield composites having mechanical properties competitive with ecologically detrimental legacy building materials.

DE Co-occurrence network analysis; Microbiome; R package; Consensus
   clustering; Module preservation analysis
AB Background Studying the co-occurrence network structure of microbial samples is one of the critical approaches to understanding the perplexing and delicate relationship between the microbe, host, and diseases. It is also critical to develop a tool for investigating co-occurrence networks and differential abundance analyses to reveal the disease-related taxa-taxa relationship. In addition, it is also necessary to tighten the co-occurrence network into smaller modules to increase the ability for functional annotation and interpretability of these taxa-taxa relationships. Also, it is critical to retain the phylogenetic relationship among the taxa to identify differential abundance patterns, which can be used to resolve contradicting functions reported by different studies. Results In this article, we present Correlation and Consensus-based Cross-taxonomy Network Analysis (C3NA), a user-friendly R package for investigating compositional microbial sequencing data to identify and compare co-occurrence patterns across different taxonomic levels. C3NA contains two interactive graphic user interfaces (Shiny applications), one of them dedicated to the comparison between two diagnoses, e.g., disease versus control. We used C3NA to analyze two well-studied diseases, colorectal cancer, and Crohn's disease. We discovered clusters of study and disease-dependent taxa that overlap with known functional taxa studied by other discovery studies and differential abundance analyses. Conclusion C3NA offers a new microbial data analyses pipeline for refined and enriched taxa-taxa co-occurrence network analyses, and the usability was further expanded via the built-in Shiny applications for interactive investigation.

AB Hydrous phases play a fundamental role in the deep-water cycle on Earth. Understanding their stability and thermoelastic properties is essential for constraining their abundance using seismic tomography. However, determining their elastic properties at extreme conditions is notoriously challenging. The challenges stem from the complex behavior of hydrogen bonds under high pressures and temperatures (P, P , T s). In this study, we evaluate how advanced molecular dynamics simulation techniques can address these challenges by investigating the adiabatic elasticity and acoustic velocities of S-AlOOH, a critical and prototypical high-pressure hydrous phase. We compared the performances of three methods to assess their viability and accuracy. The thermoelastic tensor was computed up to 140 GPa and temperatures up to 2700 K using molecular dynamics with a DeePMD machine-learning interatomic potential based on the SCAN meta-GGA functional. The excellent agreement with ambient condition single-crystal ultrasound measurements and the correct description of velocity changes induced by H-bond disorder-symmetrization transition observed at 10 GPa in Brillouin scattering measurements underscores the accuracy and efficacy of our approach.

ID TIME; CALIBRATION; CHAMP
AB Thermospheric density influences the atmospheric drag and is crucial for space missions. This paper introduces a global thermospheric density prediction framework based on a deep evidential method. The proposed framework predicts thermospheric density at the required time and geographic position with given geomagnetic and solar indices. It is called global to differentiate it from existing research that only predicts density along a satellite orbit. Through the deep evidential method, we assimilate data from various sources including solar and geomagnetic conditions, accelerometer-derived density data, and empirical models including the Jacchia-Bowman model (JB-2008) and the Naval Research Laboratory Mass Spectrometer and Incoherent Scatter Radar Extended (NRLMSISE-00) model. The framework is investigated on five test cases along various satellites from 2003 to 2015 involving geomagnetic storms with Disturbance Storm Time (Dst) values smaller than -50 nT $\mathrm{n}\mathrm{T}$. Results show that the proposed framework can generate density with higher accuracy than the two empirical models. It can also obtain reliable uncertainty estimations. Global density estimations at altitudes from 200 to 550 km are also presented and compared with empirical models on both quiet and storm conditions.

AB Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a regulated pollutant that is associated with numerous health impacts. Recent advances in epidemiology indicate high confidence linking NO2 exposure with increased mortality, an association that recent studies suggest persists even at concentrations below regulatory thresholds. While large disparities in NO2 exposure among population subgroups have been reported, U.S. NO2-attributable mortality rates and their disparities remain unquantified. Here we provide the first estimate of NO2-attributable all-cause mortality across the contiguous U.S. (CONUS) at the census tract-level. We leverage fine-scale, satellite-informed, land use regression model NO2 concentrations and census tract-level baseline mortality data to characterize the associated disparities among different racial/ethnic subgroups. Across CONUS, we estimate that the NO2-attributable all-cause mortality is similar to 170,850 (95% confidence interval: 43,970, 251,330) premature deaths yr(-1) with large variability across census tracts and within individual cities. Additionally, we find that higher NO2 concentrations and underlying susceptibilities for predominately Black communities lead to NO2-attributable mortality rates that are similar to 47% higher compared to CONUS-wide average rates. Our results highlight the substantial U.S. NO2 mortality burden, particularly in marginalized communities, and motivate adoption of more stringent standards to protect public health.

AB The switching characteristics of ferroelectrics and multiferroics are influenced by the interaction of topological defects with domain walls. We report on the pinning of polarization due to antiphase boundaries in thin films of the multiferroic hexagonal YbFeO3. We have directly resolved the atomic structure of a sharp antiphase boundary (APB) in YbFeO3 thin films using a combination of aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and total energy calculations based on density-functional theory (DFT). We find the presence of a layer of FeO6 octahedra at the APB that bridges the adjacent domains. STEM imaging shows a reversal in the direction of polarization on moving across the APB, which DFT calculations confirm is structural in nature as the polarization reversal reduces the distortion of the FeO6 octahedral layer at the APB. Such APBs in hexagonal perovskites are expected to serve as domain-wall pinning sites and hinder ferroelectric switching of the domains.

ID WORD FORM AREA; REPRESENTATION; NEURONS; CORTEX; FACE
AB A long standing goal in neuroscience has been to elucidate the functional organization of the brain. Within higher visual cortex, functional accounts have remained relatively coarse, focusing on regions of interest (ROIs) and taking the form of selectivity for broad categories such as faces, places, bodies, food, or words. Because the identification of such ROIs has typically relied on manually assembled stimulus sets consisting of isolated objects in non-ecological contexts, exploring functional organization without robust a priori hypotheses has been challenging. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a data-driven approach in which we synthesize images predicted to activate a given brain region using paired natural images and fMRI recordings, bypassing the need for category-specific stimuli. Our approach - Brain Diffusion for Visual Exploration ("BrainDiVE") - builds on recent generative methods by combining large-scale diffusion models with brain-guided image synthesis. Validating our method, we demonstrate the ability to synthesize preferred images with appropriate semantic specificity for well-characterized category-selective ROIs. We then show that BrainDiVE can characterize differences between ROIs selective for the same high-level category. Finally we identify novel functional subdivisions within these ROIs, validated with behavioral data. These results advance our understanding of the fine-grained functional organization of human visual cortex, and provide well-specified constraints for further examination of cortical organization using hypothesis-driven methods.

AB Bicontinuous interfacially-jammed emulsion gels (bijels) are increasingly used as emulsion templates for the fabrication of functional porous materials including membranes, electrodes, and biomaterials. Control over the domain size and structure is highly desirable in these applications. For bijels stabilized by spherical particles, particle size and volume fraction are the main parameters that determine the emulsion structure. Here, we investigate the use of ellipsoidal magnetic particles and study the effect of external magnetic fields on the formation of bijels. Using hybrid Lattice Boltzmann-molecular dynamics simulations, we analyze the effect of the magnetic field on emulsion dynamics and the structural properties of the resulting bijel. We find that the formation of bijels remains robust in the presence of magnetic fields, and that the domain size and tortuosity become anisotropic when ellipsoidal particles are used. We show that the magnetic fields lead to orientational ordering of the particles which in turn leads to alignment of the interfaces. The orientational order facilitates enhanced packing of particles in the interface which leads to different jamming times in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the field. Our results highlight the potential of magnetic particles for fabrication and processing of emulsion systems with tunable properties.
   Lattice Boltzmann simulations of bijels stabilized by ellipsoidal magnetic particles in external magnetic fields demonstrate the potential of magnetic particles for fabrication of emulsion systems with tunable, anisotropic properties.

TI Tunable giant anomalous Hall effect in the Kondo-lattice ferromagnet
   UBiTe
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
LA English
DT Article
AB Kondo-lattice systems are recognized for potentially hosting a variety of rich topological phases. Several pioneering studies have demonstrated significant anomalous Hall and anomalous Nernst effects in these systems, attributed to the Berry curvature of the hybridization bands. In this paper, we investigate UBiTe, a ferromagnetic Kondo-lattice system. Our findings reveal that the intrinsic contribution to the anomalous Hall conductivity is closely tied to the Kondo coherence temperature. Moreover, we demonstrate that slight shifts in the Fermi level across three different samples significantly influence this intrinsic contribution, aligning with the Berry curvature localized within the narrow hybridization bands. This provides a stark contrast to the less pronounced sensitivity observed in weakly correlated Weyl semimetals, underscoring the distinctive electronic properties of Kondo-lattice systems. The anomalous Hall conductivity of one sample ranks among the highest reported for topological magnetic materials.

AB Learning trajectories in early mathematics instruction have received increasing attention from policymakers, educators, curriculum developers, and researchers. They are generally deemed useful for guiding curriculum standards, instructional planning, and assessment. However, the specific contributions of learning trajectories to education and children's learning are unclear. We review research over the last five years to describe what is known and what still needs to be learned about methods of development, refinement, and validation of the goals, developmental progressions, and instruction of learning trajectories in early mathematics and possible advantages and disadvantages in the educational application of learning trajectories. Findings illustrate the variety of methods in creating and evaluating learning trajectories and generally confirm the validity of existing LTs, although not for all topics or implementations. Developmental progressions are generally replicable and useful for describing children's knowledge and competencies with major disagreements about DPs infrequent and refinements building upon previous results successfully. Similarly, studies generally support the efficacy of instructional activities and teaching strategies grounded in the LT approach and the benefits of continual formative evaluation and refinement of such activities, with caveats concerning their limitations. Finally, comparative studies, especially those with rigorous designs, support the efficacy of the LT approach vs. other pedagogical approaches.

AB A molecular understanding of thermoset fracture is crucial for enhancing the performance and durability across applications. However, achieving accurate atomistic modeling of thermoset fracture remains computationally prohibitive due to the high cost associated with quantum mechanical methods for describing bond breaking. In this work, we introduce an active learning (AL) framework for our recently developed machine learning-based adaptable bond topology (MLABT) model that uses data sets generated via density functional theory (DFT) calculations that are both minimalistic and informative. Employing MLABT integrated with AL and DFT, we explore fracture behavior in highly cross-linked thermosets, assessing the variations in fracture induced by system temperature, temperature fluctuations, strain rate, cooling rate, and degree of cross-linking. Notably, we discover that while fracture is minimally affected by temperature, it is strongly influenced by the strain rate. Furthermore, while the structural disparities introduced by different network annealing rates influence the elastic properties, they are inconsequential for thermoset fracture. In contrast, network topology emerges as the dominant determinant of fracture, influencing both the ultimate strain and stress. Particularly, MLABT with AL-DFT achieving near quantum-chemical bond breaking accuracy still leads to ductile failures, emphasizing the necessity of modeling polymer networks at larger length scales for bridging the gap between the experiment and simulation. Nevertheless, the integration of MLABT with the AL framework paves the way for efficient and DFT-accurate modeling of thermoset fracture, providing an affordable and accurate approach for calculating polymer network fracture across chemical space.

AB The United States faces significant challenges due to corrosion, with its impact on military and civilian infrastructure incurring over $20 billion in annual maintenance costs. The damage due to corrosion is profound, threatening structural safety, reducing esthetic value, and leading to costly repairs. To mitigate these effects, the Unified Facilities Criteria and Unified Facilities Guidance Specifications advise the use of protective coatings on metal surfaces. Early corrosion detection is crucial for maintaining structural integrity and minimizing maintenance costs. Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and deep learning, including accurate corrosion classification, have significantly revolutionized the detection and management of corrosion. Despite these advancements, automatic corrosion segmentation in civil infrastructure remains challenging due to the scarcity of images and the labor-intensive annotation process. Moreover, existing segmentation methods are unable to manage the complexities that come with high-resolution corrosion images. This paper proposes a novel, semi-supervised, convolutional neural network-based image segmentation method for the automatic identification and segmentation of corrosion on coated steel surfaces, using both unlabeled and labeled corrosion images and leveraging the mean teacher model. The proposed novel method involves three steps: (1) utilizing high-resolution digital microscopy to capture detailed images and dividing them into manageable patches; (2) applying a semi-supervised learning approach, leveraging unlabeled corrosion images for enhanced segmentation precision; and (3) employing a smoothing module to improve the continuity of information. The proposed corrosion detection method has demonstrated promising performance with only 67% labeled data, achieving mean precision, recall, F-1 measure, and intersection over union of 90.0%, 96.2%, 92.7%, and 87.1%, respectively. Even with just 33% labeled data, the method maintains strong performance when compared to fully supervised deep learning models. This demonstrates a substantial data resource saving while ensuring accurate and reliable corrosion detection, which is crucial for infrastructure health monitoring. The successful validation of this approach provides a method that dramatically reduces the amount of visual data required to generate a reliable model.

AB A model is presented whereby metamorphic parageneses are governed by local, nano-scale reactions among adjacent phases along grain boundaries that are driven by local disequilibrium between the solid phases and the grain boundary composition. These reactions modify the grain boundary composition setting up compositional gradients that drive diffusion and change the grain boundary composition elsewhere in the rock, which drive local reactions in these locations. The process may be triggered by the nucleation of a new phase that is out of equilibrium with the existing assemblage and an example is presented based on the transformation of kyanite (Ky) to sillimanite (Sil). Model results reveal that a simple polymorphic transformation (Ky -> Sil) can result in local reactions among all phases in the rock and some phases may grow in one locale and be consumed in another. An implication of these results is that interpretation of metamorphic parageneses based on growth or resorption and compositional changes of phases requires careful evaluation of nano-scale processes.

AB As a creative endeavor, scientific research requires inspiration, innovation, exploration, and divergent thinking. Yet, in K-12 settings, it is often viewed as rigid and formulaic. MindHive is a web-based platform designed to facilitate student-teacher-scientist partnerships in research on human behavior. Features support research phases (e.g., question finding, study design, peer review, iteration), and their creative dimensions, including exploration, expressiveness, collaboration, and enjoyment. Interviews with teachers and students who used MindHive show how learners describe their experiences as creative agents. This work illustrates how educational technologies can broaden STEM participation by being authentic to methodical and creative aspects of STEM research.

ID REFRACTIVE-INDEX POLYMERS; ELEMENTAL SULFUR
AB Chalcogenide hybrid inorganic/organic polymers (CHIPs) are a new class of optical polymeric materials for imaging and photonic applications due to their high refractive indices and high optical transmission at visible and infrared wavelengths. In this study, we characterize these polymers to study the refractive index and delve into the electronic properties by way of measurements of their dielectric constants. Ellipsometry is used to determine the refractive indices for wavelengths from 500 nm to 12 mu m, while we use capacitance measurements on thin film capacitors with a range of areas to find the dielectric constant. The results are in line with expectations based on the sulfur composition of the polymers-indices range from 1.7 to 1.85, and dielectric constants range from 2.6 to 3. With these measurements, these sulfur polymer materials are established to be good candidates for optical and photonic applications, particularly with respect to telecommunications. The dielectric constants suggest that applications such as electro-optic devices and capacitors may also be viable.

AB We conducted experiments on concurrent labradorite dissolution, calcite precipitation, and clay precipitation in batch reactor systems and tracked reaction processes using multiple isotope tracers. Labradorite was chosen for its role as a major and reactive component in basalt; the experiments thus directly impact our understanding of CO2 storage in basalt aquifers and enhanced rock weathering. We doped initial solutions with Si-29, Ca-43, and (CaCO3)-C-13(s). Experiments were conducted at 60 degrees C and pH similar to 8.3 for up to 840 h, with isotope ratios in the experimental aqueous solutions measured using MC-ICP-MS. Unidirectional rates of labradorite dissolution near equilibrium were approximately two orders of magnitude slower than far-from-equilibrium rates reported in the literature. Calcite growth occurred near equilibrium and the rates were limited by the labradorite dissolution rates. In the steady state phase, the interplay of these three heterogeneous reactions-labradorite dissolution, calcite growth, and clay precipitation-results in a coupled system that approaches a near-equilibrium state. The system does not reach true equilibrium because labradorite continues to dissolve, albeit at a much slower rate near equilibrium. The overall reaction can be approximated as, Na0.4Ca0.6Al1.6Si2.4O8 + 0.6HCO(3)(-) + 1<middle dot>.7H(2)O + 0.4H(+) -> 0.4Na(+) + 0.6CaCO(3(s)) + 0.5Al(2)Si(2)O(5)(OH)(4(s)) + 0.6Al(OH)(4)(-) + 1.4SiO(2)((aq))(o) The experimental results show that using short-term far-from-equilibrium rate constants would lead to an overestimation of feldspar weathering rates at the Earth's surface (e.g., basalt weathering and enhanced rock weathering) and CO2 mineralization in basalt aquifers.

AB Drug delivery systems have renewed attention in recent years to achieve targeted delivery while decreasing toxic side effects. However, there are many factors that prevent optimal administration of drug delivery particles. For instance, protein corona formation and aggregation both decrease the circulation half-life of drug delivery particles, leading to sequestration to the liver and spleen. Therefore, optimal surface modifications are needed to decrease protein corona formation and avoid aggregation. In this work, polystyrene particles were modified with multi-arm and linear polyethylene glycol (PEG) to determine their aggregation profiles and protein corona formation. Multi-arm PEGs were found to aggregate more than linear PEGs, due to the change in zeta potential from unreacted end groups, which may lead to shorter circulation half-lives. Furthermore, the protein corona formation and composition were studied after different washing procedures, highlighting the importance of studying protein corona formation with undiluted blood plasma.

AB Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a key enabler for next-generation wireless communication systems to improve spectral efficiency. However, the coexistence of sensing and communication functionalities can cause harmful interference. In this paper, we propose to use a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) in conjunction with ISAC to address this issue. The RIS is composed of a large number of low-cost elements that can adjust the amplitude and phase shift of impinging signals, thus providing a relatively high beamforming gain. To maximize the sum-rate of the communication system, we jointly optimize the beamformer at the base station (BS) and the phase shifts at the RIS, subject to a threshold on the interference power, the unit-norm constraint of the transmit power, and the unit modulus constraint of the RIS phase shifts. To efficiently tackle this NP-hard problem, we first reformulate the problem into a more tractable form using the fractional programming (FP) technique. Then, we exploit the geometrical properties of the constraints and adopt an alternating manifold-based optimization to compute the optimal active beamformer and the RIS phase shifts, respectively. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed RIS-assisted design significantly reduces the mutual interference and improves the system sum-rate for the communication system.

AB After decades of outsourcing to low-cost countries, companies are restructuring their production footprint globally. Especially having experienced supply chain disruption caused by the unprecedented Covid-19 pandemic for the past several years, many multinational companies are considering bringing their operations back home (i.e., reshoring). At the same time, the U.S. government proposes using tax penalties to motivate companies to reshore. In this paper, we study how a global supply chain adjusts its offshoring and reshoring production decisions under two different circumstances: (1) under traditional corporate tax regulations; (2) under the proposed tax penalty regulations. We analyze cost variants, tax structures, market access and production risks to identify conditions where global companies decide to bring manufacturing back to their domestic countries. Our results show that multinational companies would be more likely to relocate the production from the main foreign country to an alternative country that enjoys even lower production costs under the proposed tax penalty. As identified by our analysis and as well as numerical simulations, reshoring can only occur in rare situations such as when the production costs in the foreign countries are close to that in the domestic country. Besides potential national tax reform, we also discuss the impact of the Global Minimum Tax Rate proposed by the G7 on global companies' offshoring/reshoring decisions.

AB Particulate matter (PM) found in the air is one of the major sources of pollution and air-borne diseases. Therefore, it is imperative to examine the elemental concentration distribution of the PM to identify the pollutant sources. In this study, it has demonstrated the capabilities of micro-particle-induced X-ray emission (micro-PIXE) spectroscopy in quantitative analysis of air samples collected from the Old Delhi outdoor market and indoor locations in the Panjab University hostel in the winter months. A 2-million electronvolts energetic scanning proton micro-beam (diameter approximate to 1 mu m2) is used in micro-PIXE experiments generating high-resolution elemental maps of different regions of interest (ROI). Micro-PIXE along with the GeoPIXE analysis provides a non-destructive, standard-less, and ng/mg level-sensitive tool for the investigation of elemental distributions and highlighting pixels, which correlates to specific concentration ratios between elements at ROIs, thereby enabling a comprehensive understanding of the source of each elemental particulate. Si, Ca, and K detected in indoor PM suggest the source to soil erosion and crop burning, while high S levels in outdoor PM are primarily associated with coal power plants. Additionally, Sc, Ti, Cr, Mn, and Zn are found in outdoor samples, while indoor locations also contained trace amounts of V, Co, and Cu.

ID COMBINATION
AB The interplay between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the redox state of cells is deeply rooted in the biology of almost all organisms, regulating development, growth, and responses to the environment. Recent studies revealed that the ROS levels and redox state of one cell can be transmitted, as an information 'state' or 'currency', to other cells and spread by cell-to-cell communication within an entire community of cells or an organism. Here, we discuss the different pathways that mediate cell-to-cell signaling in plants, their hierarchy, and the different mechanisms that transmit ROS/redox signaling between different cells. We further hypothesize that ROS/redox signaling between different organisms could play a key role within the 'one world' principle, impacting human health and our future.

AB The emphasis on fairness in predictive healthcare modeling has increased in popularity as an approach for overcoming biases in automated decision-making systems. The aim is to guarantee that sensitive characteristics like gender, race, and ethnicity do not influence prediction outputs. Numerous algorithmic strategies have been proposed to reduce bias in prediction results, mitigate prejudice toward minority groups and promote prediction fairness. The goal of these strategies is to ensure that model prediction performance does not exhibit significant disparity among sensitive groups. In this study, we propose a novel fairness-achieving scheme based on multitask learning, which fundamentally differs from conventional fairness-achieving techniques, including altering data distributions and constraint optimization through regularizing fairness metrics or tampering with prediction outcomes. By dividing predictions on different sub-populations into separate tasks, we view the fairness problem as a task-balancing problem. To ensure fairness during the model-training process, we suggest a novel dynamic re-weighting approach. Fairness is achieved by dynamically modifying the gradients of various prediction tasks during neural network back-propagation, and this novel technique applies to a wide range of fairness criteria. We conduct tests on a real-world use case to predict sepsis patients' mortality risk. Our approach satisfies that it can reduce the disparity between subgroups by 98% while only losing less than 4% of prediction accuracy.

AB Brucite [Mg(OH)(2)] is a mineral of great interest owing to its various applications and roles in geological processes. Its structure, behavior under different conditions, and unique properties have been the subject of numerous studies and persistent debate. As a stable hydrous phase in subduction zones, its elastic anisotropy can significantly contribute to the seismological properties of these regions. We performed ab initio calculations to investigate brucite's stability, elasticity, and acoustic velocities. We tested several exchange-correlation functionals and managed to obtain stable phonons for the P (3) over bar phase with r(2)SCAN at all relevant pressures up to the mantle transition zone. We show that r(2)SCAN performs very well in brucite, reproducing the experimental equation of state and several key structure parameters related to hydrogen positions. The room-temperature elasticity results in P (3) over bar reproduces the experimental results at ambient pressure. These results, together with the stable phonon dispersion of P (3) over bar at all relevant pressures, indicate P (3) over bar is the stable candidate phase not only at elevated pressures but also at ambient conditions. The success of r(2)SCAN in brucite suggests this functional should be suitable for other challenging layer-structured minerals, e.g., serpentines, of great geophysical significance.

TI H-bonded organic frameworks as ultrasound-programmable delivery platform
SO NATURE
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
ID ACTIVATION
AB The precise control of mechanochemical activation within deep tissues using non-invasive ultrasound holds profound implications for advancing our understanding of fundamental biomedical sciences and revolutionizing disease treatments1, 2, 3-4. However, a theory-guided mechanoresponsive materials system with well-defined ultrasound activation has yet to be explored5,6. Here we present the concept of using porous hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) as toolkits for focused ultrasound (FUS) programmably triggered drug activation to control specific cellular events in the deep brain, through on-demand scission of the supramolecular interactions. A theoretical model is developed to potentially visualize the mechanochemical scission and ultrasound mechanics, providing valuable guidelines for the rational design of mechanoresponsive materials to achieve programmable control. To demonstrate the practicality of this approach, we encapsulate the designer drug clozapine N-oxide (CNO) into the optimal HOF nanocrystals for FUS-gated release to activate engineered G-protein-coupled receptors in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of mice and rats and hence achieve targeted neural circuit modulation even at depth 9 mm with a latency of seconds. This work demonstrates the capability of ultrasound to precisely control molecular interactions and develops ultrasound-programmable HOFs to non-invasively and spatiotemporally control cellular events, thereby facilitating the establishment of precise molecular therapeutic possibilities.

AB Despite the critical role of sintering phenomena in constraining the long-term durability of nanosized particles, a clear understanding of nanoparticle sintering has remained elusive due to the challenges in atomically tracking the neck initiation and discerning different mechanisms. Through the integration of in situ transmission electron microscopy and atomistic modeling, this study uncovers the atomic dynamics governing the neck initiation of Pt-Fe nanoparticles via a surface self-diffusion process, allowing for coalescence without significant particle movement. Real-time imaging reveals that thermally activated surface morphology changes in individual nanoparticles induce significant surface self-diffusion. The kinetic entrapment of self-diffusing atoms in the gaps between closely spaced nanoparticles leads to the nucleation and growth of atomic layers for neck formation. This surface self-diffusion-driven sintering process is activated at a relatively lower temperature compared to the classic Ostwald ripening and particle migration and coalescence processes. The fundamental insights have practical implications for manipulating the morphology, size distribution, and stability of nanostructures by leveraging surface self-diffusion processes.

AB In the current study, CuO, ZnCo2O4, CuO/ZnCo2O4, and CuO/ZnCo2O4/CNTs photocatalysts were prepared to remove crystal violet (CV) and colorless pollutants (diclofenac sodium and phenol) from wastewater. Herein, sol-gel and co-precipitation methods were used to synthesize CuO and ZnCo2O4, respectively. The sonication method was used to synthesize CuO/ZnCo2O4 and a CNTs-based composite (CuO/ZnCo2O4/CNTs). From the UV-Vis spectra of CuO, ZnCo2O4, CuO/ZnCo2O4, and CuO/ZnCo2O4/CNTs, the optical band gap value was calculated to be 2.11, 2.18, 1.71 and 1.63 eV respectively. The photocatalytic results revealed that CuO/ZnCo2O4/CNTs exhibited higher degradation of 87.7% against CV dye, 82% against diclofenac sodium, and 72% against phenol as compared to other prepared photocatalysts. The OH center dot radical is identified as the active species in the photocatalytic process over CuO/ZnCo2O4/CNTs. The impact of several parameters, such as pH, concentration, and catalyst dosage, has also been investigated. The better activity of the CNTs-based composite was due to the synergic effect of both CuO/ZnCo2O4 nanocomposite and carbon nanotubes. Therefore, the synthesized CuO/ZnCo2O4/CNTs photocatalyst has the potential to degrade organic wastewater effluents effectively.

AB Graph few-shot learning is of great importance among various graph learning tasks. Under the few-shot scenario, models are often required to conduct classification given limited labeled samples. Existing graph few-shot learning methods typically leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and perform classification across a series of meta-tasks. Nevertheless, these methods generally rely on the original graph (i.e., the graph that the meta-task is sampled from) to learn node representations. Consequently, the graph structure used in each meta-task is identical. Since the class sets are different across meta-tasks, node representations should be learned in a task-specific manner to promote classification performance. Therefore, to adaptively learn node representations across meta-tasks, we propose a novel framework that learns a task-specific structure for each meta-task. To handle the variety of nodes across meta-tasks, we extract relevant nodes and learn task-specific structures based on node influence and mutual information. In this way, we can learn node representations with the task-specific structure tailored for each meta-task. We further conduct extensive experiments on five node classification datasets under both single- and multiple-graph settings to validate the superiority of our framework over the state-of-the-art baselines.

AB Operando electron spin probes, namely magnetometry and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), provide real-time insights into the electrochemical processes occurring in battery materials and devices. In this work, we describe the design criteria and outline the development of operando magnetometry and EPR electrochemical cells. Notably, we show that a clamping mechanism, or springs, are needed to achieve sufficient compression of the battery stack and an electrochemical performance on par with that of a standard Swagelok-type cell. The tandem use of operando EPR and magnetometry allows us to identify five distinct and reversible redox processes taking place on charge and discharge of the intercalation-type LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2 0.5 Mn 0.5 O 2 Li-ion cathode. While redox processes in conversion-type electrodes are notoriously difficult to investigate using standard characterization methods (e.g. X-ray based) and/or post mortem analysis, due to the formation of poorly crystalline and metastable reaction intermediates and products during cycling, we show that operando magnetometry provides unique insight into the kinetics and reversibility of Fe nanoparticle formation in the Na3FeF6 3 FeF 6 electrode for Na-based batteries. Step increases in the cell magnetization upon extended cycling indicate the build-up of Fe nanoparticles in the system, hinting at only partially reversible charge-discharge - discharge processes. The broad applicability of the tools developed herein to a range of electrode chemistries and structures, from intercalation to conversion electrodes, and from crystalline to amorphous systems, makes them particularly promising for the development of electrochemical energy storage technologies and beyond.

AB Trisilanol polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) are a category of inorganic-organic material that comprise an inorganic open cage silica structure, organic attachments, and silanol ( - Si - OH) groups. Recently, trisilanol POSS was added to Al-based alloys, and found to promote substantial microstructural refinement, and improved mechanical strength and fatigue life compared to conventional compositions. Such microstructural modifications and property enhancements are usually attributed to silanol - Al bonds that formed within the liquid-state, prior to solidification. However, details of such high-temperature chemical interactions remain unclear. Here, we performed ab initio molecular dynamics simulations at 1500 K, to probe the chemical interactions between isolated trisilanol POSS molecule and discreet Al atoms. Al atoms modified the silanol groups to form, two energetically favorable coordinate complexes: monodentate - Si - O - Al and bidentate - (Si - O) 2 - Al. Such complexes were formed by Al atoms attracting electrons towards themselves from the POSS molecule. Crucially, this bonding mechanism allowed trisilanol POSS to organize the neighboring Al atoms into geometric motifs that can potentially serve as nucleation sites within liquid-Al, and facilitate microstructural refinement.

TI Enlisting electrochemistry to reveal melanin's redox-related properties
SO MATERIALS ADVANCES
LA English
DT Review
AB Melanin has been surprisingly difficult to characterize using either bottom-up studies focused on molecular structure or top-down studies focused on functional properties. We have been developing electrochemical methods to understand the redox-activities of melanin. These studies show that melanins from various sources: (i) are reversibly redox-active; (ii) have redox potentials in the mid-physiological range; and (iii) react with a broad range of electron-donors (i.e., reductants) and acceptors (i.e., oxidants). Spectroelectrochemically-based operando methods have shown that when melanin is exchanging electrons, it also undergoes changes in its redox state. The observation that melanin can exist in two (or possibly more) oxidized or reduced states helps to explain some of its context-dependent behaviors. For instance, when melanin is in a reduced state, it has donate-able electrons that can quench an oxidative radical or partially-reduce O2 to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). Further, melanin can promote redox-cycling when it is located in metabolically-active contexts that are characterized by steep O2-gradients because short diffusion distances separate aerobic from anaerobic conditions. We suggest that future studies may enable a fuller understanding of how melanin's redox activities contribute to its observed electrical conductivities (ionic and/or electrical), and if melanin's redox-capacitor properties confer a biological benefit (e.g., for energy harvesting).
   Melanins have complex structures, difficult-to-characterize properties, and poorly understood biological functions. Electrochemical methods are revealing how melanin's redox-state molecular-switching is coupled to its electron-transfer activities.

AB Despite improvements in chemical recycling, most post-consumer plastics are still deposited in landfills where they pose a significant threat to ecological health. Herein we report a two-stage method for chemically recycling poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) using terpenoids and waste sulfur to yield composites. In this method, post-consumer PET (from beverage bottles) undergoes transesterification with a terpenoid alcohol (citronellol or geraniol) to yield low-molecular PET oligomers. The terpene-derived alkenes in these PET oligomer derivatives then served as reaction sites for inverse vulcanization with 90 wt% elemental sulfur to form composite CPS (using citronellol) or GPS (using geraniol). Composition, mechanical, thermal, and morphological properties were characterized by NMR spectroscopy, MALDI, FT-IR spectroscopy, compressive and flexural strength analysis, TGA, DSC, elemental analysis, and SEM/EDX. The composites CPS (compressive strength = 5.20 MPa, flexural strength = 3.10 MPa) and GPS (compressive strength = 5.8 MPa, flexural strength = 2.77 MPa) showed mechanical strengths comparable to those of commercial bricks (classification C62 for general building). The approach delineated herein thus represents a method to chemically recycle waste plastic with industrial waste sulfur and plant-derived terpenoids to yield composites having favorable properties comparable to existing building materials.

DT Article
ID RING-OPENING POLYMERIZATION; POLYMERS; PLASTICS
AB A robust method is described to synthesize degradable copolymers under aqueous miniemulsion conditions using alpha-lipoic acid as a cheap and scalable building block. Simple formulations of alpha-lipoic acid (up to 10 mol %), n-butyl acrylate, a surfactant, and a costabilizer generate stable micelles in water with particle sizes <200 nm. The ready availability of these starting materials facilitated performing polymerization reactions at large scales (4 L), yielding 600 g of poly(n-butyl acrylate-stat-alpha-lipoic acid) latexes that degrade under reducing conditions (250 kg mol(-1) -> 20 kg mol(-1)). Substitution of alpha-lipoic acid with ethyl lipoate further improves the solubility of dithiolane derivatives in n-butyl acrylate, resulting in copolymers that degrade to even lower molecular weights after polymerization and reduction. In summary, this convenient and scalable strategy provides access to large quantities of degradable copolymers and particles using cheap and commercially available starting materials.

AB Studying morphological novelties offers special insights into developmental biology and evolution. The inflated calyx syndrome (ICS) is a largely unrecognized but fascinating feature of flower development, where sepals form balloon-like husks that encapsulate fruits. Despite its independent emergence in many lineages of flowering plants, the genetic and molecular mechanisms of ICS remain unknown. Early studies in the Solanaceae genus Physalis put forth key roles of MADS-box genes in ICS. However, recent work suggests these classical floral identity transcription factors were false leads. With newfound capabilities that allow rapid development of genetic systems through genomics and genome editing, Physalis has re-emerged as the most tractable model species for dissecting ICS. This review revisits current understanding of ICS and highlights how recent advancements enable a reset in the search for genetic and molecular mechanisms using unbiased, systematic approaches.

For the latter, I will focus on Taylor expansion, analytical continuation from imaginary chemical potential, and a novel expansion scheme that was recently introduced, and that allowed a substantial extension of the coverage in baryonic chemical potential. I will also introduce a few lattice-based approaches, used to study the thermodynamics in the vicinity of the critical point.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A recent line of work has shown a surprising connection between multicalibration, a multigroup fairness notion, and omniprediction, a learning paradigm that provides simultaneous loss minimization guarantees for a large family of loss functions [20, 19, 21, 18]. Prior work studies omniprediction in the batch setting. We initiate the study of omniprediction in the online adversarial setting. Although there exist algorithms for obtaining notions of multicalibration in the online adversarial setting [23], unlike batch algorithms, they work only for small finite classes of benchmark functions F, because they require enumerating every function f is an element of F at every round. In contrast, omniprediction is most interesting for learning theoretic hypothesis classes F, which are generally continuously (or at least exponentially) large.
   We develop a new online multicalibration algorithm that is well defined for infinite benchmark classes F (e.g. the set of all linear functions), and is oracle efficient - i.e. for any class F, the algorithm has the form of an efficient reduction to a no-regret learning algorithm for F. The result is the first efficient online omnipredictor - an oracle efficient prediction algorithm that can be used to simultaneously obtain no regret guarantees to all Lipschitz convex loss functions. For the class F of linear functions, we show how to make our algorithm efficient in the worst case (i.e. the "oracle" that we need is itself efficient even in the worst case). We show how our results extend beyond mean multicalibration to quantile multicalibration, with applications to oracle efficient multivalid conformal prediction. Finally, we show upper and lower bounds on the extent to which our rates can be improved: our oracle efficient algorithm actually promises a stronger guarantee called "swap-omniprediction", and we prove a lower bound showing that obtaining O(root T) bounds for swap-omniprediction is impossible in the online setting. On the other hand, we give a (non-oracle efficient) algorithm which can obtain the optimal O(root T) omniprediction bounds without going through multicalibration, giving an information theoretic separation between these two solution concepts. We leave the problem of obtaining O(v T) omniprediction bounds in an oracle efficient manner as our main open problem.

AB Microstructure analysis plays a crucial role in additive manufacturing (AM) processes as it provides significant insights into material properties and print quality. Detecting melt pool boundaries and porosity defects within microstructure samples is a complex task due to inherent image processing and data analysis challenges. To address this, we propose a deep learning-based approach that employs state-of-the-art deep learning models with convolutional neural network architectures (e.g., U-Net and FPN). This approach enables automatic segmentation and detection of melt pools and porosity in AM microstructure images. Visualization results demonstrate significant potential in accurately identifying microstructures using limited data. A comparative evaluation of various deep learning network architectures indicates that U-Net paired with EfficientNet b7 is better suited for melt pool segmentation, and the FPN with the DenseNet 201 backbone attains the highest accuracy for porosity. This work and the generated results demonstrate great promise in enhancing AM quality control through deep learning-powered microstructure analysis.

DE Causal Inference; Multi-Agent Dynamical System; GraphODE
AB Multi-agent dynamical systems refer to scenarios where multiple units (aka agents) interact with each other and evolve collectively over time. For instance, people's health conditions are mutually influenced. Receiving vaccinations not only strengthens the long-term health status of one unit but also provides protection for those in their immediate surroundings. To make informed decisions in multi-agent dynamical systems, such as determining the optimal vaccine distribution plan, it is essential for decision-makers to estimate the continuous-time counterfactual outcomes. However, existing studies of causal inference over time rely on the assumption that units are mutually independent, which is not valid for multi-agent dynamical systems. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap and study how to estimate counterfactual outcomes in multi-agent dynamical systems. Causal inference in a multi-agent dynamical system has unique challenges: 1) Confounders are timevarying and are present in both individual unit covariates and those of other units; 2) Units are affected by not only their own but also others' treatments; 3) The treatments are naturally dynamic, such as receiving vaccines and boosters in a seasonal manner. To this end, we model a multi-agent dynamical system as a graph and propose a novel model called CF-GODE (CounterFactual Graph Ordinary Differential Equations). CF-GODE is a causal model that estimates continuous-time counterfactual outcomes in the presence of inter-dependencies between units. To facilitate continuous-time estimation, we propose Treatment-Induced GraphODE, a novel ordinary differential equation based on graph neural networks (GNNs), which can incorporate dynamical treatments as additional inputs to predict potential outcomes over time. To remove confounding bias, we propose two domain adversarial learning based objectives that learn balanced continuous representation trajectories, which are not predictive of treatments and interference. We further provide theoretical justification to prove their effectiveness. Experiments on two semi-synthetic datasets confirm that CF-GODE outperforms baselines on counterfactual estimation. We also provide extensive analyses to understand how our model works.

AB Physically mixing two dissimilar polymers often results in a macroscopically segregated blend with poor optical clarity and mechanical properties. Previously, we demonstrated that chain end functionalization of immiscible polymer blends with oppositely paired acid and base groups leads to an ionic supramolecular block copolymer with electrostatically stabilized microdomains that suppress macroscopic phase separation. In this work, a functionalized polydimethylsiloxane with a photochromic diarylethene (DAE) end-group (PDMS-omega-DAE) is blended with a sulfonic acid end-functionalized polystyrene (PS-omega-SO3H), forming an ionic supramolecular block copolymer with tunable morphology by light. When the DAE is irradiated with UV light, it triggers an isomerization from the ring-opened (DAE-O) to the ring-closed (DAE-C) form. The light-induced conformational change in the chain-end group chemistry substantially alters the ionic junctions, leading to a phase structure difference in the solid-state from hexagonally packed cylinders (HEX) to lamellae (LAM). After UV radiation, the more localized positive charge on DAE-C led to stronger ionic bonds between the two dissimilar blocks, while the repulsion between adjacent DAE-C groups increased. The stronger electrostatic repulsion along the interface resulted in increased interfacial area per polymer chain and thus induced such phase transition. The light-induced phase transition of this system demonstrates that the ionic interactions can be tuned on-demand to create different morphologies from a single polymer blend.
   The light-induced conformational change in the chain-end group chemistry substantially alters the ionic junctions, leading to a phase structural difference from hexagonally packed cylinders (HEX) to lamellae (LAM) in the solid-state.

We present the adsorption energies, charge transfer to the S atom, and C-S bond lengths on each of the surfaces studied. We note that thiophene remains intact over the majority of the bimetallic surfaces, only breaking C-S bonds over 33 of the 1131 different surfaces studied. Overall, we note a positive correlation between charge transfer to the S atom and C-S bond lengths. We also report that many of the surfaces experience a large buckling of the first layer of the surface. We have made this dataset publicly available in the hopes that it will aid the search for novel hydrodesulfurization catalysts and aid the progress of employing machine learning in chemistry.

ID BINDING-SITES
AB Despite the increasing number of 3D RNA structures in the Protein Data Bank, the majority of experimental RNA structures lack thorough functional annotations. As the significance of the functional roles played by noncoding RNAs becomes increasingly apparent, comprehensive annotation of RNA function is becoming a pressing concern. In response to this need, we have developed FURNA (Functions of RNAs), the first database for experimental RNA structures that aims to provide a comprehensive repository of high-quality functional annotations. These include Gene Ontology terms, Enzyme Commission numbers, ligand-binding sites, RNA families, protein-binding motifs, and cross-references to related databases. FURNA is available at https://seq2fun.dcmb.med.umich.edu/furna/ to enable quick discovery of RNA functions from their structures and sequences.

AB A diastereoselective addition and rearrangement reaction has been developed for the synthesis of pyrrolidine-2-ylidenes from NH-isoxazolines and electron-deficient allenes. This method proceeds via the rearrangement of a proposed N-alkenylisoxazoline intermediate to generate densely functionalized pyrrolidine-2-ylidenes under simple catalyst-free conditions that tolerate ketone substituents and install relative stereochemistry at positions 3 and 4 of the heterocycle. Reaction optimization and the substrate scope are described in addition to studies evaluating the reactivity of the gem-dione and enaminone groups of the products.

AB This work is devoted to a class of stochastic infectious disease models, namely, stochastic SIRS models under imperfect vaccination. Because of the inclusion of the vaccination, the underlying models are more difficult to analyze than that of the previously considered in the literature. Our main effort is devoted to overcoming the difficulties and deriving a complete characterization of longtime behavior of systems. Numerical examples are provided to present computational evidence. These examples also provide insight that the discrete event process (the random switching) can reverse persistence to extinction, and vice versa.

AB Hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) is found in many applications due to its ease of manufacturing, useful mechanical properties over a wide temperature range, and reactive hydroxyl chain ends. Typically, HTPB is crosslinked with isocyanates to form polyurethane thermosets. Limitations of this approach include the use of toxic isocyanates and the oxidative instability of backbone alkenes. In this work, saturated HTPB is used to form reprocessable covalent adaptable networks that are capable of stress relaxation and reprocessing, without relying on isocyanates or unstable alkenes. This approach introduces dynamic chemistry to the HTPB network via chain extension and subsequent crosslinking with 4-methyl caprolactone (4mCL) and a novel bislactone crosslinker. Using benzenesulfonic acid (BSA) as a transesterification catalyst, stress relaxation times range from 150 to 8 min at temperatures of 70 to 100 C-degrees. Despite crosslinking, these networks behave elastically, as evidenced by strain-at-break values of 93% for pristine samples, and dynamically, as shown by a strain-at-break of 72% after reprocessing the damaged samples. Shape reprogramming is also demonstrated by straining the crosslinked networks and heating to elevated temperatures where bond exchange occurs. These findings illustrate the advantageous properties that can be achieved by using cheap commodity building blocks to achieve dynamic properties. We anticipate that valorizing commodity polymers into reprocessable thermosets will be of utility in applications that lack other viable recycling pathways.

AB Nanoporous materials such as metal-organic frameworks(MOFs)and covalent-organic frameworks (COFs) have been identifiedas key candidates for environmental remediation through catalyticreduction and sequestration of pollutants. Given the prevalence ofCO(2) as a target molecule for capture, MOFs and COFs haveseen a long history of application in the field. More recently, functionalizednanoporous materials have been demonstrated to improve performancemetrics associated with the capture of CO2. We employ amultiscale computational approach including ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations and classical grandcanonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations, to investigate the impactof amino acid (AA) functionalization in three such nanoporous materials.Our results demonstrate a nearly universal improvement of CO2 uptake metrics such as adsorption capacity, accessible surface area,and CO2/N-2 selectivity for six AAs. In thiswork, we elucidate the key geometric and electronic properties associatedwith improving the CO2 capture performance of functionalizednanoporous materials.

AB Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) has been extensively applied to the electrochemical analysis of the surfaces and interfaces of a photoelectrochemical (PEC) system. A semiconductor photoelectrode with a well-defined geometry and active surface area comparable to SECM's tip is highly desired for accurately quantifying interfacial charge-transfer activities and photoelectrochemically generated redox species, where the broadening effects due to the mass transfer gradient and nonlocal electron transfer at a planar semiconductor surface can be minimized. Here, we present a newly developed platform as a SECM substrate for investigating semiconductor PEC activities, which is based on a transparent ultramicroelectrode (UME) fabricated by using two-step photolithographic patterning and ion milling methods. This transparent UME with a 25 mu m recessed disk shape is fully characterized with SECM for quantifying the interfacial charge-transfer rates of IrCl62-/IrCl63- by comparing with theoretical results from finite element simulations in COMSOL Multiphysics. When coated with TiO2 nanorods as a model semiconductor material, the transparent UME can be used to quantify the catalytic PEC water oxidation in a feedback mode of SECM by sampling tip and substrate current signals simultaneously. This transparent UME-SECM study provides insights into the potential-dependent PEC water oxidation reaction mechanism and the quantitative analysis of photocurrent contributions from water oxidation and the SECM tip-generated redox mediator. The transparent UME-SECM method can be potentially expanded to other SECM operation modes such as surface interrogation for understanding the dynamics of the electrode surfaces and interfaces of a PEC system.

AB Thermal depolarization in poling-induced piezoelectric materials is defined as the disappearance of remanent polarization at a so-called depolarization temperature. A thermally stimulated depolarization current (TSDC) measurement is most widely used for examining depolarization as a function of temperature. TSDC results in the literature commonly show a gradual reduction of polarization even below depolarization temperature (T-d). However, no degradation happens when thermal heat treatments are conducted below T-d, meaning that the apparent reduction in polarization measured by TSDC is sure to be an artifact. Here, we demonstrate that such artifact is unavoidable during TSDC measurements and propose a method to circumvent it. This strategy was manifested on TSDC data collected from a relaxor ferroelectric Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O-3-PbTiO3 (PMN-PT) single crystals.

AB Reproducibility, transparency, representation, and privacy underpin the trust on genomics research in general and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in particular. Concerns about these issues can be mitigated by technologies that address privacy protection, quality control, and verifiability of GWAS. However, many of the existing technological solutions have been developed in isolation and may address one aspect of reproducibility, transparency, representation, and privacy of GWAS while unknowingly impacting other aspects. As a consequence, the current patchwork of technological tools only partially and in an overlapping manner address issues with GWAS, sometimes even creating more problems. This paper addresses the progress in a field that creates technological solutions that augment the acceptance and security of population genetic analyses. The text identifies areas that are falling behind in technical implementation or where there is insufficient research. We make the case that a full understanding of the different GWAS settings, technological tools and new research directions can holistically address the requirements for the acceptance of GWAS.

AB Marine protected areas (MPAs) are important conservation tools that confer ecosystem benefits by removing fishing within their borders to allow stocks to rebuild. Fishing mortality outside a traditionally fixed MPA can exert selective pressure for low movement alleles, resulting in enhanced protection. While evolving to move less may be useful for conservation presently, it could be detrimental in the face of climate change for species that need to move to track their thermal optimum. Here, we build a spatially explicit simulation model to assess the impact of movement evolution in and around static MPAs resulting from both fishing mortality and temperature-dependent natural mortality on conservation benefits across five climate scenarios: (i) linear mean temperature shift, (ii) El Nino/La Nina conditions, (iii) heat waves, (iv) heatwaves with a mean temperature shift, and (v) no climate change. While movement evolution allows populations within MPAs to survive longer, we find that over time, climate change degrades the benefits by selecting for higher movement genotypes. Resulting population declines within MPAs are faster than expected based on climate mortality alone, even within the largest MPAs. Our findings suggest that while static MPAs may conserve species for a time, other strategies, such as dynamic MPA networks or assisted migration, may also be required to effectively incorporate climate change into conservation planning.
   Marine protected areas (MPAs) provide important benefits for heavily fished species but are fixed in place and threatened by climate change, leading to unexplored effects on the protected communities. We show how the evolution of species movement in protected populations leads to lower movement extents inside MPAs, which extends survival for species locally but may prevent species from moving when temperatures get too hot, thereby leaving protected populations worse off than unprotected ones.image

AB Learning fair representation in deep learning is essential to mitigate discriminatory outcomes and enhance trustworthiness. However, previous research has been commonly established on inappropriate assumptions prone to unrealistic counterfactuals and performance degradation. Although some proposed alternative approaches, such as employing correlation-aware causal graphs or proxies for mutual information, these methods are less practical and not applicable in general. In this work, we propose FAir DisEntanglement with Sensitive relevance (FADES), a novel approach that leverages conditional mutual information from the information theory perspective to address these challenges. We employ sensitive relevant code to direct correlated information between target labels and sensitive attributes by imposing conditional independence, allowing better separation of the features of interest in the latent space. Utilizing an intuitive disentangling approach, FADES consistently achieves superior performance and fairness both quantitatively and qualitatively with its straightforward structure. Specifically, the proposed method outperforms existing works in downstream classification and counterfactual generations on various benchmarks.

AB The proline amino acid and prolyl residues of peptides/proteins confer unique biological and biochemical properties that motivates the development of proline-selective analysis. The study focuses on one specific class of problem, the detection of single amino acid variants involving proline, and reports a Pro-selective electrochemiluminescence (ECL) method. To develop this method, the A1-/A2- variants of milk's beta-casein protein are investigated because it is a well-established example and abundant samples are readily available. Specifically, beta-casein has 209 amino acids with 34 (or 35) proline residues: the A1-variant has a Pro-to-His substitution at position 67 (relative to the A2 variant). The study shows that proline's strong luminescence allows the generic discrimination of: Pro from other amino acids; an A2-oligopeptide from an A1-oligopeptide; the A2-beta-casein variant from the A1-variant; and commercially-available A2 milks from A1-containing regular milks. The evidence indicates that luminescence depends on proline content and accessibility, as well as signal quenching. Compared to conventional immunoassays, the ECL method is simple, rapid, and inexpensive. Further, the ECL-method is Pro-selective (vs molecularly-selective like typical immunoassays) which should make it broadly useful for studying the role of proline in biology and especially useful for tracking the digestion of proline-rich proteins in the diet.

AB This study introduces a novel green nanocomposite system of iron oxide coated with secondary metabolites (Fe3O4@SM) and compares it with commonly used materials for hyperthermia cancer treatment. Fe3O4@SM magnetic nanoparticles were synthesized through a simple co-precipitation process using metal precursors, followed by heating in pressure reactor to obtain superparamagnetic nanoparticles (Hc = 36.5-54.1 Oe at 300 K). These nanoparticles were subsequently coated with plant-based phytochemicals. XRD analysis confirmed the presence of magnetite iron oxide nanoparticles. SEM images further confirmed the spherical shape of the synthesized nanoparticles, exhibiting a face-centered cubic (FCC) iron oxide structure with sizes ranging from 12 +/- 7-85 +/- 15 nm. Characterization through dynamic light scattering (DLS) and zeta potential (zeta) analysis demonstrated colloidal stability, with a polydispersity index (PDI) ranging from 0.226 to 0.436 and zeta potential values ranging from - 29.761-1.85 mV. The surface of the nanoparticles was analyzed using GC-MS, which identified bioactive functional groups including ester (42.79 %), terpene (20.69 %), hydrocarbons (17.4 %), and carboxylic (12.37 %) compounds. Compared to Fe3O4 and Fe3O4@GO, Fe3O4@SM exhibited a higher rate of temperature increase within the therapeutic range, reaching Tmax = 45 degrees C with a heating rate (dT/dt) of 0.273 degrees C/s and specific absorption rate (SAR) of 230.6 W/g at 304 kHz and 400 Oe. In vitro assays utilizing a triple negative breast cancer microenvironment confirmed the non -toxicity of these materials through a DNS assay. The developed nanoparticles offer dual mechanisms of action, combining thermal and chemo effects, making them promising candidates for hyperthermia cancer treatment.

AB The coherent dynamics of bubble clusters are of fundamental and industrial importance, and are elusive due to the complex interactions of disordered bubble oscillations. Here we introduce and demonstrate a method for decomposition of the Lagrangian time series of bubble dynamics data by combining theory and principal component analysis. The decomposition extracts coherent features of bubble oscillations based on their energy, in a way similar to proper orthogonal decomposition of Eulerian flow field data. This method is applied to a dataset of spherical clusters under harmonic excitation at different amplitudes, with various nuclei density and polydispersity parameters. Results indicate that the underlying correlated mode of oscillations is isolated in a single dominant feature in cavitating regimes, independent of the nuclei's parameters. A systematic data analysis procedure further suggests that this feature is globally controlled by the dynamic cloud interaction parameter of Maeda and Colonius (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 862, 2019, pp. 1105-1134) that quantifies the mean-field interactions, regardless of initial polydispersity or nonlinearity. The method provides a simplified and comprehensive representation of complex bubble dynamics as well as a new path to reduced-order modelling of cavitation and nucleation.

AB Background: With the increasing integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into various aspects of daily life, there is a growing interest among designers and practitioners in incorporating AI into their fields. In health care domains like art therapy, AI is also becoming a subject of exploration. However, the use of AI in art therapy is still undergoing investigation, with its benefits and challenges being actively explored. Objective: This study aims to investigate the integration of AI into art therapy practices to comprehend its potential impact on therapeutic processes and outcomes. Specifically, the focus is on understanding the perspectives of art therapists regarding the use of AI-assisted tools in their practice with clients, as demonstrated through the presentation of our prototype consisting of a deck of cards with words covering various categories alongside an AI-generated image. Methods: Using a co-design approach, 10 art therapists affiliated with the American Art Therapy Association participated in this study. They engaged in individual interviews where they discussed their professional perspectives on integrating AI into their therapeutic approaches and evaluating the prototype. Qualitative analysis was conducted to derive themes and insights from these sessions. Results: The study began in August 2023, with data collection involving 10 participants taking place in October 2023. Our qualitative findings provide a comprehensive evaluation of the impact of AI on facilitating therapeutic processes. The combination of a deck of cards and the use of an AI-generated tool demonstrated an enhancement in the quality and accessibility of therapy sessions. However, challenges such as credibility and privacy concerns were also identified. Conclusions: The integration of AI into art therapy presents promising avenues for innovation and progress within the field. By gaining insights into the perspectives and experiences of art therapists, this study contributes knowledge for both practical application and further research.

AB Context: Newcomers joining an unfamiliar software project face numerous barriers; therefore, effective onboarding is essential to help them engage with the team and develop the behaviors, attitudes, and skills needed to excel in their roles. However, onboarding can be a lengthy, costly, and error-prone process. Software solutions can help mitigate these barriers and streamline the process without overloading senior members. Objective: This study aims to identify the state-of-the-art software solutions for onboarding newcomers. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to answer six research questions. Results: We analyzed 32 studies about software solutions for onboarding newcomers and yielded several key findings: (1) a range of strategies exists, with recommendation systems being the most prevalent; (2) most solutions are web-based; (3) solutions target a variety of onboarding aspects, with a focus on process; (4) many onboarding barriers remain unaddressed by existing solutions; (5) laboratory experiments are the most commonly used method for evaluating these solutions; and (6) diversity and inclusion aspects primarily address experience level. Conclusion: We shed light on current technological support and identify research opportunities to develop more inclusive software solutions for onboarding. These insights may also guide practitioners in refining existing platforms and onboarding programs to promote smoother integration of newcomers into software projects.

AB The increasing demand for energy-efficient and cost-effective water-splitting systems has prompted research on non-precious-metal-based electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) over a wide pH range. Molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) has received considerable attention owing to its excellent HER activity in acidic media. However, its competitive HER properties must be improved to achieve better performance in alkaline or neutral environments. In this study, we introduced an electrochemical cation implantation (ECI) process as a versatile method to enhance the electrocatalytic properties of MoS2. By modifying the microstructure of MoS2, the ECI process induced vacancies in Mo and S, primarily in the basal planes and facilitated a gradual transition from the semiconducting (2H) to metallic (1T) phase. The optimized ECI-processed MoS2 catalysts exhibited improved HER activities and low overpotentials (eta(10), 144 mV) over the entire pH range compared with bare MoS2 catalysts, highlighting the potential application of the ECI process for enhanced electrocatalysts.

AB Hybrid Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning (KGML) models, which are deep learning models that utilize scientific theory and process-based model simulations, have shown improved performance over their process-based counterparts for the simulation of water temperature and hydrodynamics. We highlight the modular compositional learning (MCL) methodology as a novel design choice for the development of hybrid KGML models in which the model is decomposed into modular sub-components that can be process-based models and/or deep learning models. We develop a hybrid MCL model that integrates a deep learning model into a modularized, process-based model. To achieve this, we first train individual deep learning models with the output of the process-based models. In a second step, we fine-tune one deep learning model with observed field data. In this study, we replaced process-based calculations of vertical diffusive transport with deep learning. Finally, this fine-tuned deep learning model is integrated into the process-based model, creating the hybrid MCL model with improved overall projections for water temperature dynamics compared to the original process-based model. We further compare the performance of the hybrid MCL model with the process-based model and two alternative deep learning models and highlight how the hybrid MCL model has the best performance for projecting water temperature, Schmidt stability, buoyancy frequency, and depths of different isotherms. Modular compositional learning can be applied to existing modularized, process-based model structures to make the projections more robust and improve model performance by letting deep learning estimate uncertain process calculations.
   Lake models based on physical processes are powerful tools for investigating how lakes and reservoirs respond to local weather and for projecting lake responses to long-term climate change. Historically, physical processes are the basis for designing these models. Due to an abundance of long-term and high-frequency data, deep learning models are used more frequently, although they do not reflect our domain expertise about hydrodynamics and heat transport. Recently, the modeling community has been focusing on merging models based on physical processes with deep learning. We are highlighting a novel methodology, modular compositional learning (MCL), that merges different modeling types in a modularized framework. Our resulting hybrid model outperformed the original model based on physical processes as well as alternative deep learning models regarding the simulation of various lake variables related to water temperature, and showed physically valid results. We are further showing various ways on how MCL can improve future lake model development and applications.

AB In this paper, we propose a novel and enhanced approach for crowd counting within the domain of manatee monitoring, aiming to significantly improve efficiency and accuracy. The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results in the challenging task of manatee counting, simplifying the work of scientists and experts in the field. Our model not only facilitates the identification and enumeration of manatees in images and videos but also excels in scenarios that pose considerable challenges for human observers. To enhance accurate counting of the manatee aggregation, we introduce a framework with three key innovations to tackle the challenge: a new approach to generate density maps during the training process, an augmented technique to balance the dataset, and a cross-domain solution to enhance overall performance. The proposed two-dimensional Gaussian kernel offers a refined method for creating density maps, providing a more robust foundation for the training phase. Additionally, we built a balanced and augmented dataset, ensuring that the model is exposed to diverse and representative instances, thus improving its generalization capabilities. Furthermore, we incorporate a cross-domain phase pretraining the model utilizing an image dataset of wild animals to initialize the weights and further improve performance. Experiments and comparisons, with respect to previously established CSRNET model presented in Wang et al. (2023), demonstrate noteworthy improvements. Remarkably, our model achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of nearly half compared to the rival approach, showcasing the substantial advancements achieved through our refined methodology. This progress boosts the reliability of manatee counting in conservation efforts and ecological research.

AB There is growing concern around the negative health impacts associated with contamination of drinking water by harmful chemicals. Technology that enables fast, cheap, and easy detection of ions and small molecules in drinking water is thus important for reducing the incidence of these negative health impacts. Here, we describe a sensor for detecting Cu2+ in water that provides colorimetric results in 15 min or less and functions in a just-add-water format. The sensor contains cheap reagents including salts, buffer, oxidant, chromogen, surfactant, and optionally a chelating agent. The sensor is assembled and lyophilized for shelf-stability and field-deployment. Rehydrating the sensor with water containing Cu2+ results in chromogen oxidation and blue color formation to visually indicate the presence of Cu2+. The sensor demonstrates high selectivity toward Cu2+ against other metal cations, functionality in field samples, shelf-stability, and can be tuned to activate at different Cu2+ threshold concentrations. This sensor thus has the potential to meet a variety of needs, such as point-of-need testing for Cu2+ to ensure water supplies meet health guidelines, such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Lead and Copper Rule.

AB Codes with locality, also known as locally recoverable codes, allow for recovery of erasures using proper subsets of other coordinates. These subsets are typically of small cardinality to promote recovery using limited network traffic and other resources. Hierarchical locally recoverable codes allow for recovery of erasures using sets of other symbols whose sizes increase as needed to allow for recovery of more symbols. In this paper, we describe a hierarchical recovery structure arising from geometry in Reed-Muller codes and codes with availability from fiber products of curves. We demonstrate how the fiber product hierarchical codes can be viewed as punctured subcodes of Reed-Muller codes, uniting the two constructions. This point of view provides natural structures for local recovery with availability at each level in the hierarchy.

TI Fate of methane in canals draining tropical peatlands

AB Tropical wetlands and freshwaters are major contributors to the growing atmospheric methane (CH4) burden. Extensive peatland drainage has lowered CH(4)emissions from peat soils in Southeast Asia, but the canals draining these peatlands may be hotspots of CH4 emissions. Alternatively, CH4 oxidation (consumption) by methanotrophic microorganisms may attenuate emissions. Here, we used laboratory experiments and a synoptic survey of the isotopic composition of CH4 in 34 canals across West Kalimantan, Indonesia to quantify the proportion of CH4 that is consumed and therefore not emitted to the atmosphere. We find that CH4 oxidation mitigates 76.4 +/- 12.0% of potential canal emissions, reducing emissions by similar to 70 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1). Methane consumption also significantly impacts the stable isotopic fingerprint of canal CH4 emissions. As canals drain over 65% of peatlands in Southeast Asia, our results suggest that CH4 oxidation significantly influences landscape-scale CH4 emissions from these ecosystems.

TI Reversible and size-controlled assembly of reflectin proteins using a
   charged azobenzene photoswitch
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
LA English

AB Disordered proteins often undergo a stimuli-responsive, disorder-to-order transition which facilitates dynamic processes that modulate the physiological activities and material properties of cells, such as strength, chemical composition, and reflectance. It remains challenging to gain rapid and spatiotemporal control over such disorder-to-order transitions, which limits the incorporation of these proteins into novel materials. The reflectin protein is a cationic, disordered protein whose assembly is responsible for dynamic color camouflage in cephalopods. Stimuli-responsive control of reflectin's assembly would enable the design of biophotonic materials with tunable color. Herein, a novel, multivalent azobenzene photoswitch is shown to be an effective and non-invasive strategy for co-assembling with reflectin molecules and reversibly controlling assembly size. Photoisomerization between the trans and cis (E and Z) photoisomers promotes or reduces Coulombic interactions, respectively, with reflectin proteins to repeatedly cycle the sizes of the photoswitch-reflectin assemblies between 70 nm and 40 nm. The protein assemblies formed with the trans and cis isomers show differences in interaction stoichiometry and secondary structure, which indicate that photoisomerization modulates the photoswitch-protein interactions to change assembly size. Our results highlight the utility of photoswitchable interactions to control reflectin assembly and provide a tunable synthetic platform that can be adapted to the structure, assembly, and function of other disordered proteins.
   We demonstrate reversible size control of protein assemblies formed from a disordered protein and multivalent photoswitch. This work offers a photoresponsive platform to control protein assembly.

AB In this work, we present a finite deformation, fully coupled thermomechanical crystal plasticity framework. The model includes temperature dependence in the kinematic formulation, constitutive law and governing equilibrium equations. For demonstration, we employ the model to study the evolution and formation of residual stresses, residual statistically stored dislocation density and residual lattice rotation due solely to solid state thermal cycling. The calculations reveal the development of microplasticity within the microstructure provided that the temperature change in the thermal cycle is sufficiently large. They also show, for the first time, that the thermal cycling generates an internally evolving strain rate, where the contributions of mechanical strain and plasticity depend on temperature change. The calculations suggest a strong connection between the maximum temperature of a given cycle and the magnitude of the residual stresses generated after the cycle. A pronounced influence of elastic anisotropy on the heterogeneity of the residual stress distribution is also demonstrated here. Finally, we calculate lattice rotation obtained from thermal cycling ranging from +/- 0.4 degrees\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\pm 0.4<^>{\circ }$$\end{document} and show the relation between changes in predominant slip systems with short range intragranular lattice rotation gradients. The model can benefit metal process design, especially where large strains and/or large temperature changes are involved, such as bulk forming and additive manufacturing.

TI Eulerian-Lagrangian Fluid Simulation on Particle Flow Maps

DT Article
DE Fluid Simulation; Eulerian-Lagrangian Method; Particle Flow Map
ID COHERENT STRUCTURES
AB We propose a novel Particle Flow Map (PFM) method to enable accurate long-range advection for incompressible fluid simulation. The foundation of our method is the observation that a particle trajectory generated in a forward simulation naturally embodies a perfect flow map. Centered on this concept, we have developed an Eulerian-Lagrangian framework comprising four essential components: Lagrangian particles for a natural and precise representation of bidirectional flow maps; a dual-scale map representation to accommodate the mapping of various flow quantities; a particle-to-grid interpolation scheme for accurate quantity transfer from particles to grid nodes; and a hybrid impulse-based solver to enforce incompressibility on the grid. The efficacy of PFM has been demonstrated through various simulation scenarios, highlighting the evolution of complex vortical structures and the details of turbulent flows. Notably, compared to NFM, PFM reduces computing time by up to 49 times and memory consumption by up to 41%, while enhancing vorticity preservation as evidenced in various tests like leapfrog, vortex tube, and turbulent flow.

AB High-quality monoclinic Cr3Te4 crystals are synthesized by the chemical vapor transport method and confirmed by synchrotron powder x-ray diffraction. Critical behaviors of Cr3Te4 are studied by bulk isothermal magnetization measurements around its paramagnetic to ferromagnetic phase transition. From these data, we evaluate the modified Arrott plot, the Kouvel-Fisher plot, and critical isotherms, and estimate critical exponent values of beta - 0.3827, gamma - 1.2119, and delta - 4.16, and the Curie temperature TC approximate to 321 K. After the scaling, the isothermal magnetization curves below and above the critical temperatures collapse into two independent universal branches which signifies the reliability of our critical exponent estimation. The estimated critical exponent values of Cr3Te4 do not match well with theoretically calculated values of any three-dimensional models.

AB NarK nitrate/nitriteantiporter imports nitrate (a mineralformof the essential element nitrogen) into the cell and exports nitrite(a metabolite that can be toxic in high concentrations) out of thecell. However, many details about its operational mechanism remainpoorly understood. In this work, we performed steered molecular dynamicssimulations of anion translocations and quantum-chemistry model calculationsof the binding sites to study the wild-type NarK protein and its R89Kmutant. Our results shed light on the importance of the two strictlyconserved binding-site arginine residues (R89 and R305) and two glycine-richsignature motifs (G164-M176 and G408-F419) in anion movement throughthe pore. We also observe conformational changes of the protein duringanion migration. For the R89K mutant, our quantum calculations reveala competition for a proton between the anion (especially nitrite)and lysine, which can potentially slow down or even trap the anionin the pore. Our findings provide a possible explanation for the strikingexperimental finding that the arginine-to-lysine mutation, despitepreserving the charge, impedes or abolishes anion transport in suchmutants of NarK and other similar nitrate/nitrite exchangers.

AB The growing number of Milky Way satellites detected in recent years has introduced a new focus for stellar abundance analysis. Abundances of stars in satellites have been used to probe the nature of these systems and their chemical evolution. However, for most satellites, only centrally located stars have been examined. This paper presents an analysis of three stars in the Tucana V system, one in the inner region and two at similar to 10 ' (7-10 half-light radii) from the center. We find a remarkable chemical diversity between the stars. One star exhibits enhancements in rapid neutron-capture elements (an r-I star), and another is highly enhanced in C, N, and O but with low neutron-capture abundances (a CEMP-no star). The metallicities of the stars analyzed span more than 1 dex from [Fe/H] = -3.55 to -2.46. This, combined with a large abundance range of other elements like Ca, Sc, and Ni, confirms that Tuc V is an ultrafaint dwarf (UFD) galaxy. The variation in abundances, highlighted by [Mg/Ca] ratios ranging from +0.89 to -0.75, among the stars demonstrates that the chemical enrichment history of Tuc V was very inhomogeneous. Tuc V is only the second UFD galaxy in which stars located at large distances from the galactic center have been analyzed, along with Tucana II. The chemical diversity seen in these two galaxies, driven by the composition of the noncentral member stars, suggests that distant member stars are important to include when classifying faint satellites and that these systems may have experienced more complex chemical enrichment histories than previously anticipated.

AB Recently, we derived experimental oscillator strengths (OSs) from well-defined UV-visible absorption spectral peaks of 100 molecules in solution. Here, we focus on a subset of transitions with the highest reliability to further benchmark the OSs from several wave function methods and density functionals. We consider multiple basis sets, transition moment gauges (length, velocity, and mixed), and solvent corrections. Most transitions in the comparison set come from conjugated molecules and have pi -> pi* character. We use an automated algorithm to assign computed transitions to experimental bands. OSs computed using the Tamm-Dancoff approximation (TDA), CIS, or EOM-CCSD exhibited a strong gauge dependence, which is diminished in linear response theories (TD-DFT, TD-HF, and to a smaller degree LR-CCSD). OSs calculated from TD-DFT with PCM solvent models are systematically larger than apparent OSs derived from experimental spectra. For example, f(comp) from hybrid functionals and PCM have mean absolute errors that are similar to 10% of n<middle dot>f(exp), where n is a solvent refractive index factor that arises from the energy flux of the radiation field in a dielectric (solvent). Theoretical cavity field corrections considering spherical cavities do not improve the agreement between computed and experimental data. Corrections that account for the molecular shape and the direction of transition dipole moments, or that explicitly account for the effect of solvent molecules on the local field, should be more appropriate.

AB Isomeric quinolyloxenium cations were generated in the gas phase in an ion trap mass spectrometer to explore their reactions. The structures of some products were identified via collision-activated dissociation experiments involving model compounds to demonstrate that they have the expected heavy atom connectivity. The lack of radical reactions suggests that the cations have closed-shell singlet electronic ground states. Calculations (CASPT2/CASSCF(16,14)/cc-pVTZ//CASSCF(16,14)/cc-pVTZ) predict that their closed-shell singlet ((1)A') ground states are lower in energy by ca. 25 kcal mol(-1) than their lowest-lying excited states. All cations are reactive toward dimethyl disulfide, dimethyl sulfide, and allyl iodide and most toward water and moderately reactive toward cyclohexane, reflecting their strongly electrophilic nature. They form adducts with nucleophiles in exothermic reactions (ca. 50 kcal mol(-1) for dimethyl sulfide) that can fragment or be stabilized via IR emission. Most water adducts spontaneously isomerize to lower-energy tautomers. The nucleophiles preferentially add to those carbon atoms in the benzene ring that have the greatest positive charge (but not the carbonyl carbon). The cations react with cyclohexane via hydride abstraction by the oxygen atom. This is the only reaction that initially involves the oxygen atom and hence reflects the formally positively charged, monovalent oxygen atom in these cations.

TI Analytical model and dynamical phase-field simulation of terahertz
   transmission across ferroelectrics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
LA English
DT Article
ID SPECTROSCOPY; TRANSITIONS
AB We theoretically investigate the steady-state transmission of continuous terahertz (THz) wave across a freestanding ferroelectric slab. Based on the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire theory of ferroelectrics and the coupled equations of motion for polarization and electromagnetic (EM) waves, we derive the analytical expressions of the frequency- and thickness-dependent dielectric susceptibility and transmission coefficient at the thin slab limit in the harmonic excitation regime. When the slab thickness is much smaller than the THz wavelength in the ferroelectric, the analytical predictions agree well with the numerical simulations from a dynamical phase-field model that incorporates the coupled dynamics of strain, polarization, and EM wave in multiphase systems. At larger thicknesses, the transmission is mainly determined by the frequency-dependent attenuation of THz waves in the ferroelectric and the formation of a standing polarization/THz wave. Our results advance the understanding of the interaction between THz wave and ferroelectrics and suggest the potential of exploiting ferroelectrics to achieve low-heat-dissipation, nonvolatile voltage modulation of THz transmission for high-data-rate wireless communication.

ID LINEAR CODES; EQUIVALENT
AB In this paper, we consider the hull of an algebraic geometry code, meaning the intersection of the code and its dual. We demonstrate how codes whose hulls are algebraic geometry codes may be defined using only rational places of Kummer extensions (and Hermitian function fields in particular). Our primary tool is explicitly constructing non-special divisors of degrees g and g - 1 on certain families of function fields with many rational places, accomplished by appealing to Weierstrass semigroups. We provide explicit algebraic geometry codes with hulls of specified dimensions, producing along the way linear complementary dual (LCD) algebraic geometric codes from the Hermitian function field (among others) using only rational places and an answer to an open question posed by Ballet and Le Brigand for particular function fields. These results complement earlier work by Mesnager, Tang, and Qi that use lower-genus function fields as well as instances using places of a higher degree from Hermitian function fields to construct LCD codes and that of Carlet, Mesnager, Tang, Qi, and Pellikaan to provide explicit algebraic geometry codes with the LCD property rather than obtaining codes via monomial equivalences.

AB Learning Assistant Reflection, Guidance, and Exploration (LA-RGE) is a new program at San Jose State University designed to provide support for university faculty working with learning assistants (LAs). Faculty in LA-RGE attend facilitated bi-weekly meetings throughout the semester which discuss various topics about pedagogy, LAs, and equity. In this presentation, we will discuss a research study on what kind of support is being provided by this program and how that can potentially lead to better partnerships between faculty and LAs. During one-on-one interviews, we asked faculty to discuss their personal experiences over the time they have worked with LAs, and if LA-RGE meetings have had any effect on their perspective and relationship with their LA. We then categorized the different effects and support that faculty were receiving through LA-RGE. This work will be important toward understanding how support for faculty can lead to a more productive partnership between faculty and LAs.

AB Island systems provide important contexts for studying processes underlying lineage migration, species diversification, and organismal extinction. The Hawaiian endemic mints (Lamiaceae family) are the second largest plant radiation on the isolated Hawaiian Islands. We generated a chromosome-scale reference genome for one Hawaiian species, Stenogyne calaminthoides, and resequenced 45 relatives, representing 34 species, to uncover the continental origins of this group and their subsequent diversification. We further resequenced 109 individuals of two Stenogyne species, and their purported hybrids, found high on the Mauna Kea volcano on the island of Hawai'i. The three distinct Hawaiian genera, Haplostachys, Phyllostegia, and Stenogyne, are nested inside a fourth genus, Stachys. We uncovered four independent polyploidy events within Stachys, including one allopolyploidy event underlying the Hawaiian mints and their direct western North American ancestors. While the Hawaiian taxa may have principally diversified by parapatry and drift in small and fragmented populations, localized admixture may have played an important role early in lineage diversification. Our genomic analyses provide a view into how organisms may have radiated on isolated island chains, settings that provided one of the principal natural laboratories for Darwin's thinking about the evolutionary process.
   Hawaiian endemic mints represent the second largest plant radiation in the archipelago. Here, the authors present a reference genome and numerous resequenced individuals to uncover evidence for polyploidy, geographic speciation and localized hybridization underlying diversification in this lineage

AB A gold-catalyzed method for N-alkenylation has been developed for NH-isoxazolines, which are challenging substrates for alternative transition-metal-catalyzed N-functionalization reactions. Generation of a vinyl gold intermediate from the addition of NH-isoxazolines to gold-activated ynamides initiates a diastereoselective [3,3 ']-sigmatropic rearrangement to give 2-amino-1-pyrrolines. Optimization of this transformation is described, in addition to reaction scope, the use of chiral auxiliaries for the preparation of chiral nonracemic 2-amino-1-pyrrolines, and mechanistic insight. This method prepares heterocycles that are difficult to access through traditional approaches with an enabling gold-catalyzed disconnection.

ID RESONANCE
AB Monolayers with closely packed molecules of amphiphilic EuTTA deposited on plasmonic metal demonstrate bright luminescence in contrast with diluted systems and theoretical predictions of full quenching. In order to better understand the role of intermolecular interactions and surface plasmons, we study the spontaneous emission in EuTTA ultra-thin films in dielectric and plasmonic environment. The emission kinetics in systems with closely packed emitters strongly differs from that in diluted emitters. The kinetics and spectra are very sensitive to the environment. Using multilayered structures, we were able to enhance the magnetic to electric dipole transition branching ratio by more than order of magnitude.

AB This study employed experimental data as the initial microstructure for molecular dynamics simulation of grain growth in polycrystalline nickel, aiming to investigate the relationship between grain boundary curvature and velocity in impurity-free systems. A bidirectional method for converting data between voxelized and atomic structures was developed and validated. The outcomes of the MD grain growth simulation broadly matched the characteristics of grain growth observed in the experiment. Most significantly, the simulation result contributes additional evidence supporting the reported absence of a correlation between velocity and curvature during grain growth in polycrystals, and confirms that this is not related to solutes, precipitates, processing route, or characterization method. The implication is that features of the 3D grain boundary network interfere with the velocity/curvature relationship.

AB Our group recently developed a family of side-chain amino acid-functionalized poly(S-alkyl-L-homocysteines), Xaa-C-H (Xaa = generic amino acid), which possess the ability to form environmentally responsive coacervates in water. In an effort to further study how the molecular structure affects polypeptide coacervate formation, we prepared side-chain amino acid-functionalized poly(S-alkyl-rac-cysteines), Xaa- rac -C, via post-polymerization modification of poly(dehydroalanine), A(DH) . The use of the A(DH) platform allowed straightforward synthesis of a diverse range of side-chain amino acid-functionalized polypeptides via direct reaction of unprotected l-amino acid 2-mercaptoethylamides with A(DH) . Despite their differences in the main-chain structure, we found that Xaa- rac -C can form coacervates with properties similar to those seen with Xaa-C-H . These results suggest that the incorporation of side-chain amino acids onto polypeptides may be a way to generally favor coacervation. The incorporation of L-methionine in Met- rac -C allowed the preparation of coacervates with improved stability against high ionic strength media. Further, the presence of additional thioether groups in Met- rac -C resulted in an increased solubility change upon oxidation allowing facile reversible redox switching of coacervate formation in aqueous media.

AB When appropriately integrated into smart grid technology, artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential of significantly improving the grid's efficiency, reliability, and resiliency. The development of advanced AI algorithms relies heavily on access to comprehensive datasets, which represents as the major challenge due to the proprietary and sensitive nature of grid-related data. Utility data are always of restricted access, requiring data-sharing agreements for specific purposes. In light of these limits, the use of synthetic network and data becomes a necessity for research, algorithm development, and performance comparisons. In this paper, a systematic modeling approach is proposed to acquire extreme weather conditions, to extract weather-prone features of synthetic grid models, and to develop a stochastic impact model of extreme weather on distribution grids. It is shown that synthetic weather conditions can be generated using standard distributions and their impacts on outages in distribution networks can be systematically analyzed and determined. The proposed methodology uses a set of fragility curves to describe the extent of weather impacts on physical features, which can be applied and validated in a straightforward way to real-world networks and extreme weather conditions once data of the actual physical networks and their past impact outcomes becomes available. The proposed methodology is provided as open source, ensuring accessibility and transparency for further research and application.

AB Quartz-based minerals in earth's crust are well-known to contain water-related defects within their volume-constrained lattice, and they are responsible for strength-loss. Experimental observations of natural alpha-quartz indicate that such defects appear as hydroxyl groups attached to Si atoms, called Griggs defect (Si-OH), and molecular water (H2O) located at the interstitial sites. However, factors contributing to the formation of Griggs and interstitial H2O defects remain unclear. For example, the role of point defects like vacancy sites (O2- and Si (4+)), and substitutional (Al3+) and interstitial (Li+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, etc.) ions has remained largely unexplored. Here, we performed ab initio molecular dynamics at 300 K to examine the energetics and structure of water-related defects in volume-constrained alpha-quartz. Several configurations were systematically interrogated by incorporating interstitial H2O, O2- and Si (4+) vacancies, substitutional Al3+, and interstitial Li (+,) Ca (2+) and Mg2+ ions within alpha-quartz. Interstitial H2O defect was found to be energetically favorable in the presence of Substitutional Al3+, and interstitial Ca2+, Mg (2+), and Li1+. In the presence of O2- and Si4+ vacancies, H2O showed a strong tendency to dissociate into OH-to form Griggs defect-and a proton; even in the presence of substitutional and interstitial ions. These ions distorted the alpha-quartz lattice and, in the extreme case, disrupted long-range order to form local amorphous domains; consistent with experimental reports. Our study provides an initial framework for understanding the impact of water within the crystal lattice of an anhydrous silicate mineral such as quartz. We provide not only thermodynamic and process-related information on observed defects, but also provides guidelines for future studies of water's impact on the behavior of silicate minerals.

AB Detailed information about the historical range of variability in wildfire activity informs adaptation to future climate and disturbance regimes. Here, we describe one of the first annually resolved reconstructions of historical (1500-1900 CE) fire occurrence in coast Douglas-fir dominated forests of the west slope of the Cascade Range in western Oregon. Mean fire return intervals (MFRIs) across 16 sites within our study area ranged from 6 to 165 years. Variability in MFRIs was strongly associated with average maximum summer vapor pressure deficit. Fire occurred infrequently in Douglas-fir forest stands seral to mountain hemlock or silver fir, but fire frequency was much shorter than predicted by theory in other forest types. MFRIs within Douglas-fir stands seral to western hemlock or grand fir ranged from 19 to 45 years, and MFRIs in stands seral to Douglas-fir ranged from 6 to 11 years. There was little synchrony in fire occurrence or tree establishment across 16 sites separated by 4 km. The lack of synchrony in fire suggests that large, wind-driven fire events that are often considered to be characteristic of coast Douglas-fir forests were not an important driver of succession in our study area during the last similar to 400-500 years. Climate was more arid than normal during fire years in most forest types, but historical fire in stands seral to Douglas-fir was strongly associated with antecedent moisture and less strongly associated with drought. We interpret the extraordinary tempo of fire we observed in stands seral to Douglas-fir and the unique climate pattern associated with fire in these stands to be indicative of Indigenous fire stewardship. This study provides evidence of far more frequent historical fire in coast Douglas-fir forests than assumed by managers or scientists-including some of the most frequent fire return intervals documented in the Pacific Northwest. We recommend additional research across the western Cascades to create a comprehensive account of historical fire in highly productive forests with significant cultural, economic, and ecological importance.

TI Vortex structure and spectrum of an atomic Fermi superfluid in a
   spherical bubble trap
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
LA English
DT Article
ID QUANTIZED VORTEX; GIANT VORTEX; STATES
AB The structures of multiply quantized vortices (MQVs) of an equal-population atomic Fermi superfluid in a rotating spherical bubble trap approximated as a thin shell are analyzed by solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) equation throughout the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)-Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) crossover. Consistent with the Poincare-Hopf theorem, a pair of vortices emerge at the poles of the rotation axis in the presence of azimuthal symmetry and the compact geometry provides confinement for the MQVs. While the single-vorticity vortex structure is similar to that in a planar geometry, higher-vorticity vortices exhibit interesting phenomena at the vortex center, such as a density peak due to accumulation of a normal Fermi gas and reversed circulation of current due to in-gap states carrying angular momentum in the BCS regime but not the BEC regime because of the subtle relations between the order parameter and density. The energy spectrum shows the number of the in-gap state branches corresponds to the vorticity of a vortex, and an explanation based on a topological correspondence is provided.

TI Electrobiofabrication of antibody sensor interfaces within a 3D printed

AB We report the integration of 3D printing, electrobiofabrication, and protein engineering to create a device that enables near real-time analysis of monoclonal antibody (mAb) titer and quality. 3D printing was used to create the macroscale architecture that can control fluidic contact of a sample with multiple electrodes for replicate measurements. An analysis "chip" was configured as a "snap-in" module for connecting to a 3D printed housing containing fluidic and electronic communication systems. Electrobiofabrication was used to functionalize each electrode by the assembly of a hydrogel interface containing biomolecular recognition and capture proteins. Specifically, an electrochemical thiol oxidation is used to assemble a thiolated polyethylene glycol hydrogel, that in turn is covalently coupled to either a cysteine-tagged protein G that binds the antibody's Fc region or a lectin that binds the glycans of target mAb analytes. We first show the design, assembly, and testing of the hardware device. Then, we show the transition of a step-by-step sensing methodology (e.g., mix, incubate, wash, mix, incubate, wash, measure) into the current method where functionalization, antibody capture, and assessment are performed in situ and in parallel channels. Both titer and glycan analyses were found to be linear with antibody concentration (to 0.2 mg/L). We further found the interfaces could be reused with remarkably similar results. Because the interface assembly and use are simple, rapid, and robust, we suggest this assessment methodology will be widely applicable, including for other biomolecular process development and manufacturing environments.
   A 3D printed microfluidic platform is developed for rapid monitoring of monoclonal antibody (mAb) titer and quality: 8 parallel micro-channels provide robust and parallel for off-line, at-line, and even on-line analyses. We use electrofabrication to create the sensing interface. We use redox communication to exchange molecular information with electronics. Importantly, the hydrogel interfaces can be stripped, regenerated, and reused for series analyses. Our results suggest this assessment platform will be widely applicable, potentially for many biomolecular process development and manufacturing environments. image

AB Conventional isotope-ratio mass spectrometry measurements obscure position-specific isotope distributions in molecular compounds because these measurements require an initial step that converts compounds into simple gases by combustion or pyrolysis. Here, we used electrospray ionization (ESI)-based Orbitrap mass spectrometry to measure oxygen isotope ratios in the phosphate and hydroxyl moieties of inositol phosphates. A thermal hydrolysis experiment was conducted using O-18-labeled water to examine the position-specific oxygen isotope exchange in inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) as well as its hydrolysis products IP5, IP3, and PO3 fragments. Measurement precisions of the position-specific and molecular-average oxygen isotope values of inositol phosphates were better than +/- 1.1 parts per thousand and +/- 0.5 parts per thousand, respectively. Under optimized ionization and Orbitrap parameters, this level of precision was obtained within 30 min of run time at 60 mu M initial concentration of inositol phosphate. The ability to measure phosphate-specific oxygen isotopes in inositol phosphate enabled the quantification of isotope exchange, which did not occur in phosphate on IP6, IP5, IP3, and PO3 fragments, meaning that the change in isotopes should have resulted from hydroxyls in the ring. Isotope mass balance calculations corroborated that hydroxyl oxygens are derived from O-18-labeled water. With the observed sensitivity and precision achieved in this study, Orbitrap IRMS proved to be a promising tool for investigating the position-specific oxygen isotopes in organophosphorus compounds. These outcomes open up numerous potential applications that can expand our understanding of phosphorus cycling in the environment.

AB Nanoparticle networks have potential applications in brain-like computing yet their ability to adopt different states remains unexplored. In this work, we reveal the dynamics of the attachment of polyelectrolytes onto gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), using a bottom-up two-bead-monomer dissipative particle dynamics (TBM-DPD) model to show the heterogeneity of polymer coverage. We found that the use of one polyelectrolyte homopolymer limits the complexity of the possible engineered nanoparticle networks (ENPNs) that can be built. In addressing this challenge, we first found the commensurability rules between the numbers of AuNPs and poly(allylamine hydrochloride)s (PAHs). This gives rise to a well-defined valency of a AuNP which is the maximum number of PAHs that it can accommodate. We further use an engineered block copolymer, which has a conductive middle block to mediate the distance between a dimer of AuNP. We argue that by controlling the length of conductive block that is connecting the AuNPs and their respective topology, we can have ENPNs potentially adopt multiple states necessary for primitive neuromorphic computing.

AB The spatial Kibble-Zurek mechanism is applied to the Kitaev chain with inhomogeneous pairing interactions that vanish in half of the lattice and result in a quantum critical point separating the superfluid and normal-gas phases in real space. The weakly-interacting BCS theory predicts scaling behavior of the penetration of the pair wavefunction into the normal-gas region different from conventional power-law results due to the non-analytic dependence of the BCS order parameter on the interaction. The Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) equation produces numerical results confirming the scaling behavior and hints complications in the strong-interaction regime. The limiting case of the step-function quench reveals the dominance of the BCS coherence length in absence of additional length scale. Furthermore, the energy spectrum and wavefunctions from the BdG equation show abundant in-gap states from the normal-gas region in addition to the topological edge states.

AB Biogenic alkenes, such as isoprene and alpha-pinene, are the predominant source of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted into the atmosphere. Atmospheric processing of alkenes via reaction with ozone leads to formation of zwitterionic reactive intermediates with a carbonyl oxide functional group, known as Criegee intermediates (CIs). CIs are known to exhibit a strong absorption (pi* <- pi) in the near ultraviolet and visible (UV-vis) region due to the carbonyl oxide moiety. This study focuses on the laboratory identification of a five-carbon CI with an unsaturated substituent, 3-penten-2-one oxide, which can be produced upon atmospheric ozonolysis of substituted isoprenes. 3-Penten-2-one oxide is generated in the laboratory by photolysis of a newly synthesized precursor, (Z)-2,4-diiodopent-2-ene, in the presence of oxygen. The electronic spectrum of 3-penten-2-one oxide was recorded by UV-vis induced depletion of the VUV photoionization signal on the parent m/z 100 mass channel using a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. The resultant electronic spectrum is broad and unstructured with peak absorption at ca. 375 nm. To complement the experimental findings, electronic structure calculations are performed at the CASPT2(12,10)/aug-cc-pVDZ level of theory. The experimental spectrum shows good agreement with the calculated electronic spectrum and vertical excitation energy obtained for the lowest energy conformer of 3-penten-2-one oxide. In addition, OH radical products resulting from unimolecular decay of energized 3-penten-2-oxide CIs are detected by UV laser-induced fluorescence. Finally, the experimental electronic spectrum is compared with that of a four-carbon, isoprene-derived CI, methyl vinyl ketone oxide, to understand the effects of an additional methyl group on the associated electronic properties.

DE runtime analysis; variable cost model; adaptive strategies
AB The usual approach in runtime analysis is to derive estimates on the number of fitness function evaluations required by a method until a suitable element of the search space is found. One justification for this is that in real applications, fitness evaluation often contributes the most computational effort. A tacit assumption in this approach is that this effort is uniform and static across the search space. However, this assumption often does not hold in practice: some candidates may be far more expensive to evaluate than others. This might occur, for example, when fitness evaluation requires running a simulation or training a machine learning model.
   Despite the availability of a wide range of benchmark functions coupled with various runtime performance guarantees, the runtime analysis community currently lacks a solid perspective of handling variable fitness cost. Our goal with this paper is to argue for incorporating this perspective into our theoretical toolbox. We introduce two models of handling variable cost: a simple non-adaptive model together with a more general adaptive model. We prove cost bounds in these scenarios and discuss the implications for taking into account costly regions in the search space.

AB The cell envelope of Gram-negative bacteria is composed of an outer membrane (OM) and an inner membrane (IM) and a peptidoglycan cell wall (CW) between them. Combined with Braun's lipoprotein (Lpp), which connects the OM and the CW, and numerous membrane proteins that exist in both OM and IM, the cell envelope creates a mechanically stable environment that resists various physical and chemical perturbations to the cell, including turgor pressure caused by the solute concentration difference between the cytoplasm of the cell and the extracellular environment. Previous computational studies have explored how individual components (OM, IM, and CW) can resist turgor pressure although combinations of them have been less well studied. To that end, we constructed multiple OM-CW systems, including the Lpp connections with the CW under increasing degrees of strain. The results show that the OM can effectively resist the tension imposed by the CW, shrinking by only 3-5% in area even when the CW is stretched to 2.5x its relaxed area. The area expansion modulus of the system increases with increasing CW strain, although the OM remains a significant contributor to the envelope's mechanical stability. Additionally, we find that when the protein TolC is embedded in the OM, its stiffness increases.

ID DARK-MATTER
AB While most searches for cosmic axions so far focused on their cold relics as (a component of) dark matter, various well-motivated cosmological sources can produce "boosted" axions that remain relativistic today. We demonstrate that existing/upcoming neutrino experiments such as Super-Kamiokande, Hyper-Kamiokande, DUNE, JUNO, and IceCube can probe such energetic axion relics. The characteristic signature is the monoenergetic single photon signal from axion absorption induced by the axion-photon coupling. This proposal offers to cover parameter ranges complementary to existing axion searches and provides new opportunities for discovery with neutrino facilities.

AB This study investigates three types of foam core materials used in composite sandwich structures at various densities: H60, H100, F50, F90, PN115, PN200 and PN250. Three-point bending test is conducted to determine relationships between material and flexural properties at both room and low temperature Arctic conditions. X-ray micro-computed tomography is utilized to observe the microstructural relationships between foam density and mechanical properties of the core. This study evaluates Arctic temperature effects on mechanical properties for various types of foam core at varying densities with the intention for future Arctic applications. Although foam core materials become more brittle at a lower temperature, their flexural stiffness and flexural strength are further increased. However, due to the enhanced brittleness, the energy required for fracture is significantly reduced at low temperature conditions. This study utilizes statistical analysis to create contour plots and linear regression equations to predict flexural properties as a function of temperature and foam density. Molecular dynamics simulation is employed to verify experimental results to elucidate the effect of temperature on material behavior. This work provides a deeper understanding of how flexural strength relates to foam density, adding to existing data on foam strength properties under compressive, shear and tensile loads.

AB Temperature is known to impact Li-ion battery performance and safety, however, understanding of its effect has largely been limited to uniform high or low temperatures. While the insights gathered from such research are important, limited information is available on the effects of non-uniform temperatures. In this paper, the effect of a microscale, temperature hotspot on a Li-ion battery was characterized using in situ micro-Raman spectroscopy, in situ optical microscopy and thermal simulations. Our results show that mild temperature heterogeneity induced by the micro-Raman laser can cause Li to leach out from LiC6 and LiC12 in the absence of an applied current. The leached Li is found to be localized to the temperature hotspot and is not observed upon uniform heating indicating that temperature heterogeneity is responsible for causing Li leaching. It is proposed that temperature heterogeneity induces spatial heterogeneity in graphite's degree of lithiation which can lead to Li leaching.

AB Queer theory in STEM education research is often used as a synonym for studying LGBT+ students or queer issues. However, queer theory and queer methods can be applied to discipline-based education research far more broadly. In this paper I introduce a unique perspective on "queering" quantitative and qualitative research methods and highlight some of the ways these methods are already compatible with the goals of physics education research. This will include discussions of deconstructing binaries, empowering participants in the research process, and reimagining study design to attain novel insights about the experiences of physicists.

AB Using microwave irradiation, PtCo alloy nanoparticles were deposited within a few minutes on COOH-functionalized MWCNT supports. The obtained catalysts were used for selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde, a reaction whose products are widely used in various fields. In the selective cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation to cinnamyl alcohol, microwave-prepared catalysts (generically, PtxCoy-MW) outperformed a catalyst prepared by the conventional method (Pt1Co2-con). The highest selective hydrogenation to cinnamyl alcohol, 89%, was obtained using Pt1Co2-MW, while Pt1Co2-con showed a selectivity of 76%. Characterization results confirmed that the microwave prepared samples had a stronger interaction between Pt and Co than that in the Pt1Co2-con sample. The alloyed Co altered the electronic structure of Pt, leading to favorable adsorption of the C=O bond by the lone-pair electrons of its oxygen atom. Moreover, the Pt1Co2-MW sample showed neglectable change in catalytic performance (e. g., cinnamaldehyde conversion and selective hydrogenation to cinnamyl alcohol) during recycling experiments.

AB While significant efforts are being devoted to improving the ionic conductivity of lithium solid electrolytes (SEs), electronic transport, which has an important role in the calendar life, energy density, and cycling stability of solid-state batteries (SSBs), is rarely studied. Here, the electronic conductivities of three representative SEs, including Li3PS4, Li7La3Zr2O12, and Li3YCl6, are reported. It is reported that the electronic conductivities of SEs are overestimated from the conventional measurements. By revisiting direct current polarizations using two-blocking-electrode cells and the Hebb-Wagner approach, their sources of inaccuracy are provided and the anodic decomposition of SE is highlighted as the key source for the overestimated result. Modifications in the electrode selection and data interpretation are also proposed to approach the intrinsic electronic conductivity of SEs. A two-step polarization method is also proposed to estimate the electronic conductivity of sulfides that decompose during measurement. Measured by the modified approach, the electronic conductivities of all SEs are one or two orders of magnitude lower than the reported value. Despite that, the electronic conductivity of sulfides seems to be still quite high to enable SSBs with a long calendar life of >10 years, highlighting the critical need for a more careful study of electronic transport in lithium SEs.

AB Recent efforts have sought to develop paramagnetic molecular quantum bits (qubits) as a means to store and manipulate quantum information. Emerging structure-property relationships have shed light on electron spin decoherence mechanisms. While insights within molecular quantum information science have derived from synthetic systems, biomolecular platforms would allow for the study of decoherence phenomena in more complex chemical environments and further leverage molecular biology and protein engineering approaches. Here we have employed the exchange-coupled S-T = 1/2 Fe2S2 active site of putidaredoxin, an electron transfer metalloprotein, as a platform for fundamental mechanistic studies of electron spin decoherence toward spin-based biological quantum sensing. At low temperatures, decoherence rates were anisotropic, reflecting a hyperfine-dominated decoherence mechanism, standing in contrast to the anisotropy of molecular systems observed previously. This mechanism provided a pathway for probing spatial effects on decoherence, such as protein vs solvent contributions. Furthermore, we demonstrated spatial sensitivity to single point mutations via site-directed mutagenesis and temporal sensitivity for monitoring solvent isotope exchange. Thus, this study demonstrates a step toward the design and construction of biomolecular quantum sensors.

AB The monoclinic (In 0.25 Al 0.75 )(2)O-3 alloy has been suggested as an ideal material to create monoclinic Ga2O3 heterostructures, as it provides a close lattice match to beta- Ga2O3 along with a 1 eV conduction-band offset. Achieving intentional n-type doping in Ga2O3 heterostructures is important for device applications, but this may be difficult due to the high Al content of this alloy. Here, we use density functional theory with a hybrid functional to investigate common donor dopants, in particular, Si, Sn, C, and Ge substituting on cation sites, and H interstitials, in In2O3 and InAlO3. We identify Si as the optimal donor, as it is a shallow donor for In concentrations above 14%. Its formation energy is also low, indicating that these donors will incorporate during growth. For higher In concentrations, Sn (above 33% In) and Ge (above 35% In) are also promising donors, with Sn having comparable formation energies to Si.

AB Direct air capture (DAC) of CO2 is a carbon-negative technology to mitigate carbon emissions, and it requires low-cost sorbents with high CO2 sorption capacity that can be easily manufactured on a large scale. In this work, we develop highly porous membrane adsorbents comprising branched polyethylenimine (PEI) impregnated in low-cost, porous Solupor supports. The effect of the PEI molecular mass and loading on the physical properties of the adsorbents is evaluated, including porosity, degradation temperature, glass transition temperature, and CO(2 )permeance. CO2 capture from simulated air containing 400 ppm of CO2 in these sorbents is thoroughly investigated as a function of temperature and relative humidity (RH). Polymer dynamics was examined using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and broadband dielectric spectroscopy (BDS), showing that CO2 sorption is limited by its diffusion in these PEI-based sorbents. A membrane adsorbent containing 48 mass% PEI (800 Da) with a porosity of 72% exhibits a CO2 sorption capacity of 1.2 mmol/g at 25 C-degrees and RH of 30%, comparable to the state-of-the-art adsorbents. Multicycles of sorption and desorption were performed to determine their regenerability, stability, and potential for practical applications.

AB With emerging online topics as a source for numerous new events, detecting unseen / rare event types presents an elusive challenge for existing event detection methods, where only limited data access is provided for training. To address the data scarcity problem in event detection, we propose MetaEvent, a meta learningbased framework for zero- and few-shot event detection. Specifically, we sample training tasks from existing event types and perform meta training to search for optimal parameters that quickly adapt to unseen tasks. In our framework, we propose to use the clozebased prompt and a trigger-aware soft verbalizer to efficiently project output to unseen event types. Moreover, we design a contrastive meta objective based on maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) to learn class-separating features. As such, the proposed MetaEvent can perform zero-shot event detection by mapping features to event types without any prior knowledge. In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MetaEvent in both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios, where the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in extensive experiments on benchmark datasets FewEvent and MAVEN.

AB The spontaneous gradient polymerization was investigated by ATRP and RAFT. The model monomers for both systems were methyl methacrylate (MMA) and ethyl acrylate (EA). Spontaneous gradient polymers were generated; however, the control over a polymer structure varied with both the polymerization method and the initiator structure. RAFT polymerization was found to have the best control while using a chain transfer agent (CTA) compatible with both the methacrylic and acrylic monomers. The use of this dual compatible CTA allowed for efficient RAFT polymerization and gave excellent correlation of experimental and theoretical molecular weights, dispersities below 1.3, and reactivity ratios consistent with spontaneous gradient formation. In contrast, the RAFT CTA with a less effective homolytic leaving group led to poor correlation between experimental and theoretical molecular weights and dispersity typically above 1.5. In general, ATRP led to somewhat higher dispersity polymers in the order of 1.4-1.5 with decreased correlation of experimental and theoretical molecular weights despite the formation of gradients. Reactivity ratios for both MMA and EA were determined by using a terminal reactivity model. The reactivity ratios were similar to those in conventional radical polymerization as the propagating radicals were identical. Although similar, RAFT and ATRP are not fully interchangeable in gradient polymerization with RAFT offering a simpler approach to gradient polymers when the CTA compatible with both monomers is selected.

AB We routinely have physical interactions with others, whether it be handing someone a glass of water or jointly moving a heavy object together. These sensorimotor interactions between humans typically rely on visual feedback and haptic feedback. Recent single-participant studies have highlighted that the unique noise and time delays of each sense must be considered to estimate the state, such as the position and velocity, of one's own movement. However, we know little about how visual feedback and haptic feedback are used to estimate the state of another person. Here, we tested how humans utilize visual feedback and haptic feedback to estimate the state of their partner during a collaborative sensorimotor task. Across two experiments, we show that visual feedback dominated haptic feedback during collaboration. Specifically, we found that visual feedback led to comparatively lower task-relevant movement variability, smoother collaborative movements, and faster trial completion times. We also developed an optimal feedback controller that considered the noise and time delays of both visual feedback and haptic feedback to estimate the state of a partner. This model was able to capture both lower task-relevant movement variability and smoother collaborative movements. Taken together, our empirical and modeling results support the idea that visual accuracy is more important than haptic speed to perform state estimation of a partner during collaboration.

Unlike most vertebrates, sex-changing fishes have the remarkable ability to change reproductive sex during adulthood in response to social stimuli, offering a unique opportunity to understand mechanisms by which the nervous system can initiate and coordinate sexual differentiation.MethodsThis study explores sexual differentiation of the forebrain using single nucleus RNA-sequencing in the anemonefish Amphiprion ocellaris, producing the first cellular atlas of a sex-changing brain.ResultsWe uncover extensive sex differences in cell type-specific gene expression, relative proportions of cells, baseline neuronal excitation, and predicted inter-neuronal communication. Additionally, we identify the cholecystokinin, galanin, and estrogen systems as central molecular axes of sexual differentiation. Supported by these findings, we propose a model of sexual differentiation in the conserved vertebrate social decision-making network spanning multiple subtypes of neurons and glia, including neuronal subpopulations within the preoptic area that are positioned to regulate gonadal differentiation.ConclusionsThis work deepens our understanding of sexual differentiation in the vertebrate brain and defines a rich suite of molecular and cellular pathways that differentiate during adult sex change in anemonefish.
   The first cellular atlas of the forebrain of a sex changing fish.Sex differences in nuclear transcriptomes were observed for multiple different cell types including several different types of glutamate and GABAergic neurons, microglia, radial glia, and oligodendrocytes.Sex differences in the proportion of multiple different types of glutamate neurons, one type of GABAergic neuron and two types of radial glia were observed.Female anemonefish displayed approximately twice as many cholecystokinin-positive/galanin receptor positive glutamate neurons that map to the dorsal medial telencephalon as compared to males.Large sex differences were observed in the proportion of neurons that map to the preoptic area expressing specific sex steroid hormone receptors and neuropeptide receptors, e.g., esr2a, esr2b, cckbr, and pgr.
   This study provides key insights into brain sex differences in sex-changing anemonefish (Amphiprion ocellaris), a species that changes sex in adulthood in response to the social environment. Using single nucleus RNA-sequencing, the study provides the first brain cellular atlas showing sex differences in two crucial reproductive areas: the preoptic area and telencephalon. The research identifies notable sex-differences in cell-type proportions and gene expression, particularly in radial glia and glutamatergic neurons that co-express the neuropeptide cholecystokinin. It also highlights differences in preoptic area neurons likely involved in gonadal regulation. This work deepens our understanding of sexual differentiation of the brain in vertebrates, especially those capable of adult sex change, and illuminates key molecular and cellular beginning and endpoints of the process.

AB Architecturally hindered crystallization of bottlebrush graft copolymers offers a reaction- and solvent-free pathway for creating injectable elastomers with tissue-mimetic softness. Currently, injectable materials involve solvents and chemical reactions, leading to uncontrolled swelling, leaching of unreacted moieties, and side reactions with tissue. To address this issue, bottlebrush copolymers with a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) amorphous block and crystallizable poly(lactic acid) (PLA) grafted chains (A-g-B) were synthesized, with grafted chains of controlled length arranged along the backbone at controlled spacing. The densely grafted PEG brush is leveraged to architecturally control both the rate and degree of crystallization of PLA grafts, offering tunability of mechanical properties as a function of architecture and time in a single-component solvent-free system covering a broad range of aggregation states comprising fluid-, paste-, and elastomer-like behaviors with modulus ranging from 1 to 50 kPa. The PLA-g-PEG pastes are particularly interesting, as they combine solvent-free injectability and time-controlled formation of shape-persistent elastomers at constant temperature. This molecular paste platform may advance reconstructive surgery, drug depots, and tissue engineering.

AB Recent years have seen excellent progress in modelling the entrainment of T similar to 10(4) K atomic gas in galactic winds. However, the entrainment of cool, dusty T similar to 10-100 K molecular gas, which is also observed outflowing at high velocity, is much less understood. Such gas, which can be 10(5) times denser than the hot wind, appears extremely difficult to entrain. We run 3D wind-tunnel simulations with photoionization self-shielding and evolve thermal dust sputtering and growth. Unlike almost all such simulations to date, we do not enforce any artificial temperature floor. We find efficient molecular gas formation and entrainment, as well as dust survival and growth through accretion. Key to this success is the formation of large amounts of 10(4) K atomic gas via mixing, which acts as a protective 'bubble wrap' and reduces the cloud overdensity to chi similar to 100. This can be understood from the ratio of the mixing to cooling time. Before entrainment, when shear is large, t(mix)/t(cool) less than or similar to 1, and gas cannot cool below the 'cooling bottleneck' at 5000 K. Thus, the cloud survival criterion is identical to the well-studied purely atomic case. After entrainment, when shear falls, t(mix)/t(cool) > 1, and the cloud becomes multiphase, with comparable molecular and atomic masses. The broad temperature PDF, with abundant gas in the formally unstable $50 \, {\rm K} \lt T \lt 5000 \, {\rm K}$ range, agrees with previous ISM simulations with driven turbulence and radiative cooling. Our findings have implications for dusty molecular gas in stellar and active galactic nuclei outflows, cluster filaments, 'jellyfish' galaxies, and asymptomatic giant branch winds.

AB Obesity is an ever-increasing phenomenon, with 42% of Americans being considered obese (BMI >= 30) and 9.2% being considered morbidly obese (BMI >= 40) as of 2016. With obesity being characterized by an abundance of adipose tissue expansion, abnormal tissue remodeling is a typical consequence. Importantly, this pathological tissue expansion is associated with many alterations in the cellular populations and phenotypes within the tissue, lending to cellular, paracrine, mechanical, and metabolic alterations that have local and systemic effects, including diabetes and cardiovascular disease. In particular, vascular dynamics shift during the progression of obesity, providing signaling cues that drive metabolic dysfunction. In this review, paracrine-, autocrine-, and matrix-dependent signaling between adipocytes and endothelial cells is discussed in the context of the development and progression of obesity and its consequential diseases, including adipose fibrosis, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.

AB Serine integrases are phage- (or mobile element-) encoded enzymes that catalyse site-specific recombination reactions between a short DNA sequence on the phage genome (attP) and a corresponding host genome sequence (attB), thereby integrating the phage DNA into the host genome. Each integrase has its unique pair of attP and attB sites, a feature that allows them to be used as orthogonal tools for genome modification applications. In the presence of a second protein, the Recombination Directionality Factor (RDF), integrase catalyses the reverse excisive reaction, generating new recombination sites, attR and attL. In addition to promoting attR x attL reaction, the RDF inhibits attP x attB recombination. This feature makes the directionality of integrase reactions programmable, allowing them to be useful for building synthetic biology devices. In this report, we describe the degree of orthogonality of both integrative and excisive reactions for three related integrases (phi C31, phi BT1, and TG1) and their RDFs. Among these, TG1 integrase is the most active, showing near complete recombination in both attP x attB and attR x attL reactions, and the most directional in the presence of its RDF. Our findings show that there is varying orthogonality among these three integrases - RDF pairs. phi C31 integrase was the least selective, with all three RDFs activating it for attR x attL recombination. Similarly, phi C31 RDF was the least effective among the three RDFs in promoting the excisive activities of the integrases, including its cognate phi C31 integrase. phi BT1 and TG1 RDFs were noticeably more effective than phi C31 RDF at inhibiting attP x attB recombination by their respective integrases, making them more suitable for building reversible genetic switches. AlphaFold-Multimer predicts very similar structural interactions between each cognate integrase - RDF pair. The binding surface on the RDF is much more conserved than the binding surface on the integrase, an indication that specificity is determined more by the integrase than the RDF. Overall, the observed weak integrase/RDF orthogonality across the three enzymes emphasizes the need for identifying and characterizing more integrase - RDF pairs. Additionally, the ability of a particular integrase's preferred reaction direction to be controlled to varying degrees by non-cognate RDFs provides a path to tunable, non-binary genetic switches.

AB Organic chromophores initiate much of daytime aqueous phase chemistry in the environment. Thus, studying the absorption spectra of commonly used organic photosensitizers is paramount to fully understand their relevance in environmental processes. In this work, we combined UV-Vis spectroscopy, H-1-NMR spectroscopy, quantum chemical calculations, and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the absorption spectra of 4-benzoyl benzoic acid (4BBA), a widely used photosensitizer and a common proxy of environmentally relevant chromophores. Solutions of 4BBA at different pH values show that protonated and deprotonated species have an effect on its absorbance spectra. Theoretical calculations of these species in water clusters provide physical and chemical insights into the spectra. Quantum chemical calculations were conducted to analyze the UV-Vis absorbance spectra of 4BBA species using various cluster sizes, such as C6H5COC6H4COOH & BULL;(H2O)(n), where n = 8 for relatively small clusters and n = 30 for larger clusters. While relatively small clusters have been successfully used for smaller chromophores, our results indicate that simulations of protonated species of 4BBA require relatively larger clusters of n = 30. A comparison between the experimental and theoretical results shows good agreement in the pH-dependent spectral shift between the hydrated cluster model and the experimental data. Overall, the theoretical and empirical results indicate that the experimental optical spectra of aqueous phase 4BBA can be represented by the acid-base equilibrium of the keto-forms, with a spectroscopically measured pK(a) of 3.41 & PLUSMN; 0.04. The results summarized here contribute to a molecular-level understanding of solvated organic molecules through calculations restricted to cluster models, and thereby, broader insight into environmentally relevant chromophores.

AB With the ever-growing demands of communication quality and rate, the combination of terrestrial networks and space networks is becoming the next recognized solution. The space-ground integrated network (SGIN) is a massive Internet of Things (IoT) network that accommodates large amounts of mobile terminals. The interactivity of information between those terminals will request higher communication rates and lead to more frequent handovers, which will increase the network burden and degrade the user's experience, especially in ultra-dense Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks. In this article, a modified matching algorithm is proposed to get the optimal association matrix between users and base stations. Based on the results, the sum rate of users and the handover rate are calculated. A modified particle swarm optimization (MPSO) method is also proposed to generate the special-shaped beams on the satellites to deal with the complex optimization problems. By combining the MPSO-based beamforming algorithm and the modified matching algorithm, the non-convex sum-rate optimization problem is decomposed into two optimal subproblems, which are solved separately. The simulation results demonstrate that the SGIN significantly outperforms the non-integrated ones in terms of the sum data rate and backhaul capacity. The handover performance under the user mobility model is also discussed.

AB The widespread adoption of Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems in healthcare institutes has generated vast amounts of medical data, offering significant opportunities for improving healthcare services through deep learning techniques. However, the complex and diverse modalities and feature structures in real-world EHR data pose great challenges for deep learning model design. To address the multi-modality challenge in EHR data, current approaches primarily rely on hand-crafted model architectures based on intuition and empirical experiences, leading to sub-optimal model architectures and limited performance. Therefore, to automate the process of model design for mining EHR data, we propose a novel neural architecture search (NAS) frame-work named AutoFM, which can automatically search for the optimal model architectures for encoding diverse input modalities and fusion strategies. We conduct thorough experiments on real-world multi-modal EHR data and prediction tasks, and the results demonstrate that our framework not only achieves significant performance improvement over existing state-of-the-art methods but also discovers meaningful network architectures effectively.

AB Trans technology - technology created to help address challenges that trans people face - is an important area for innovation that can help improve marginalized people's lives. We conducted 104 interviews with 115 creators of trans technology to understand how they involved trans people and communities in design processes. We describe projects that used human-centered design processes, as well as design processes that involved trans people in smaller ways, including gathering feedback from users, conducting user testing, or the creators being trans themselves. We show how involving trans people and communities in design is vital for trans technologies to realize their potential for addressing trans needs. Yet we highlight a frequent gap between trans technology design and deployment, and discuss ways to bridge this gap. We argue for the importance of involving community in trans technology design to ensure that trans technology achieves its promise of helping address trans needs and challenges.

ID RESOURCE-ALLOCATION
AB Network slicing is a key technique in 5G and beyond for efficiently supporting diverse services. Many network slicing solutions rely on deep learning to manage complex and high-dimensional resource allocation problems. However, deep learning models suffer limited generalization and adaptability to dynamic slicing configurations. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that integrates constrained optimization methods and deep learning models, resulting in strong generalization and superior approximation capability. Based on the proposed framework, we design a new neural-assisted algorithm to allocate radio resources to slices to maximize the network utility under interslice resource constraints. The algorithm exhibits high scalability, accommodating varying numbers of slices and slice configurations with ease. We implement the proposed solution in a system-level network simulator and evaluate its performance extensively by comparing it to state-of-the-art solutions including deep reinforcement learning approaches. The numerical results show that our solution obtains near-optimal quality-of-service satisfaction and promising generalization performance under different network slicing scenarios.

AB We study the constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs), in which an agent aims to maximize the expected cumulative reward subject to a constraint on the expected total value of a utility function. Existing approaches have primarily focused on soft constraint violation, which allows compensation across episodes, making it easier to satisfy the constraints. In contrast, we consider a stronger hard constraint violation metric, where only positive constraint violations are accumulated. Our main result is the development of the first model-free, simulator-free algorithm that achieves a sub-linear regret and a sub-linear hard constraint violation simultaneously, even in large-scale systems. In particular, we show that (O) over tilde (root d(3)H(4)K) regret and (O) over tilde (root d(3)H(4)K) hard constraint violation bounds can be achieved, where K is the number of episodes, d is the dimension of the feature mapping, H is the length of the episode. Our results are achieved via novel adaptations of the primal-dual LSVI-UCB algorithm, i.e., it searches for the dual variable that balances between regret and constraint violation within every episode, rather than updating it at the end of each episode. This turns out to be crucial for our theoretical guarantees when dealing with hard constraint violations.

AB Liquid-liquid phase separation in biology has recently been shown to play a major role in the spatial control of biomolecular components within the cell. However, as they are phase transitions, these processes also display nontrivial dynamics. A model phase-separating system of DNA nanostars provides unique access to nucleation physics in a biomolecular context, as phase separation is driven near room temperature by highly thermo-responsive DNA hybridization and at modest DNA concentrations. By measuring the delay time for phase-separated droplets to appear, we demonstrate that the dynamics of DNA nanostar phase separation reflect that of a metastable binary mixture of patchy particles. For sufficiently deep temperature quenches, droplets undergo spinodal decomposition and grow spontaneously, driven by Brownian motion and coalescence of phase-separated droplets, as confirmed by comparing experimental measurements to particle-based simulations. Near the coexistence boundary, droplet growth slows substantially, indicative of a nucleation process. The temperature dependence of droplet appearance times can be predicted by a classical nucleation picture with mean field exponents and demonstrates that a theory previously used to predict equilibrium phase diagrams can also distinguish spinodal and nucleation dynamical regimes. These dynamical principles are relevant to behaviors associated with liquid-liquid phase separating systems, such as their spatial patterning, reaction coupling, and biological function.

AB This study proposes a novel planning framework based on a model predictive control formulation that incorporates signal temporal logic (STL) specifications for task completion guarantees and robustness quantification. This marks the first-ever study to apply STL-guided trajectory optimization for bipedal locomotion push recovery, where the robot experiences unexpected disturbances. Existing recovery strategies often struggle with complex task logic reasoning and locomotion robustness evaluation, making them susceptible to failures due to inappropriate recovery strategies or insufficient robustness. To address this issue, the STL-guided framework generates optimal and safe recovery trajectories that simultaneously satisfy the task specification and maximize the locomotion robustness. Our framework outperforms a state-of-the-art locomotion controller in a high-fidelity dynamic simulation, especially in scenarios involving crossed-leg maneuvers. Furthermore, it demonstrates versatility in tasks such as locomotion on stepping stones, where the robot must select from a set of disjointed footholds to maneuver successfully.

AB Thanks to its fixed-point arithmetic and SIMD-like vectorization, among fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) schemes that allow computation on encrypted data, RNS-CKKS is widely used for privacy-preserving machine learning services. Prior works have partly automated a daunting scale management task required for RNS-CKKS fixed-point arithmetic, yet none takes an output error into consideration, preventing users from exploring a better error-latency trade-off.
   This work proposes a new error- and latency-aware scale management (ELASM) scheme for the RNS-CKKS FHE scheme. By actively controlling the scale of a ciphertext, one can effectively make the impact of noise on an error smaller because an error is a scaled noise introduced by an RNS-CKKS operation. ELASM explores different scale management plans that repurpose an upscale operation as an error reduction operation, estimates the output error and latency of each plan, and iteratively finds the best plan that minimizes the error-latency cost function. In addition, this work proposes a new scale-to-noise ratio (SNR) parameter and introduces fine-grained noise-aware waterlines (a minimum scale requirement) for different RNS-CKKS operations, opening a new opportunity to further improve an error-latency trade-off.
   This work implements the proposed ideas in the ELASM compiler along with a new FHE language and type system that enforces the RNS-CKKS constraints including SNR-based noise-aware waterlines. For ten machine and deep learning benchmarks, ELASM finds the better error and latency trade-offs (lower Pareto curves) than the state-of-the-art solutions such as EVA and Hecate.

AB Relaxor-based ferroelectric single crystals possess colossal piezoelectric and dielectric properties and have been attractive for a wide range of electromechanical applications including transducers, sensors, and actuators. However, domain dynamics of relaxor ferroelectric single crystals are still not fully understood despite significant progress in the last three decades, partly because of the combined relaxor and normal ferroelectrics with complex domain structures within the material. Without a comprehensive understanding of domain dynamics, rational domain engineering for high piezoelectricity is challenging. In this review, we review experimental methods for characterizing domain dynamics in nanoscale and bulk mesoscale that exhibit both intrinsic and extrinsic contributions. We focus on literature published since 2010 and critically evaluate their strengths and limitations. From an overview of recent understanding, we highlight the need for real-time observations at appropriate time and length scales and cross-validation of different methods for precise measurements of domain dynamics.

AB Recent studies indicate that kernel machines can often perform similarly or better than deep neural networks (DNNs) on small datasets. The interest in kernel machines has been additionally bolstered by the discovery of their equivalence to wide neural networks in certain regimes. However, a key feature of DNNs is their ability to scale the model size and training data size independently, whereas in traditional kernel machines model size is tied to data size. Because of this coupling, scaling kernel machines to large data has been computationally challenging. In this paper, we provide a way forward for constructing large-scale general kernel models, which are a generalization of kernel machines that decouples the model and data, allowing training on large datasets. Specifically, we introduce EigenPro 3.0, an algorithm based on projected dual preconditioned SGD and show scaling to model and data sizes which have not been possible with existing kernel methods. We provide a PyTorch based implementation which can take advantage of multiple GPUs.

AB Reconfigurable surfaces enable on-demand manipulation of electromagnetic wave properties in a controllable manner. These surfaces have been shown to enhance mmWave wireless networks in many ways, including blockage recovery. In this paper, we investigate the security vulnerabilities associated with the deployment of reconfigurable surfaces, i.e., an adversary may deploy new rogue surfaces or tamper with already-deployed surfaces to maliciously engineer the reflection pattern. In particular, we introduce Metasurface-enabled Sideband Steering (MeSS), a new metasurface-in-the-middle attack in which the spectral-spatial properties of the reflected wavefront are manipulated such that a concealed sideband channel is created in the spectral domain and steered toward the eavesdropper location, while maintaining the legitimate link toward the victim intact. We fabricate a custom reconfigurable surface prototype and evaluate MeSS through theoretical analysis as well as over-the-air experiments at the 60 GHz band. Our results indicate that MeSS significantly reduces empirical secrecy capacity (up to 81.7%) while leaving a small power penalty at the victim that can be masked under normal channel fluctuations.

AB Holmberg 15A (H15A), the brightest cluster galaxy of A85, has an exceptionally low central surface brightness even among local massive elliptical galaxies with distinct stellar cores, making it exceedingly challenging to obtain high-quality spectroscopy to detect a supermassive black hole (SMBH) at its center. Aided by the superb sensitivity and efficiency of KCWI at the Keck II Telescope, we have obtained spatially resolved stellar kinematics over a similar to 100 '' x 100 '' contiguous field of H15A for this purpose. The velocity field exhibits a low-amplitude (similar to 20 km s-1) rotation along a kinematic axis that is prominently misaligned from the photometric major axis, a strong indicator that H15A is triaxially shaped with unequal lengths for the three principal axes. Using 2500 observed kinematic constraints, we perform extensive calculations of stellar orbits with the triaxial Schwarzschild code, TriOS, and search over similar to 40,000 galaxy models to simultaneously determine the mass and intrinsic 3D shape parameters of H15A. We determine a ratio of p = 0.89 for the middle-to-long principal axes and q = 0.65 for the short-to-long principal axes. Our best estimate of the SMBH mass, MBH=(2.16-0.18+0.23)x1010M circle dot , makes H15A-along with NGC 4889-the galaxy hosting the most massive SMBHs known in the local Universe. Both SMBHs lie significantly above the mean MBH-sigma scaling relation. Repeating the orbit modeling with the axisymmetrized version of TriOS produces worse fits to the KCWI kinematics and increases MBH to (2.55 +/- 0.20) x 1010 M circle dot, which is still significantly below the MBH = (4.0 +/- 0.8) x 1010 M circle dot reported in a prior axisymmetric study of H15A.

AB Artificial cells, synthetic cells, or minimal cells are microengineered cell-like structures that mimic the biological functions of cells. Artificial cells are typically biological or polymeric membranes where biologically active components, including proteins, genes, and enzymes, are encapsulated. The goal of engineering artificial cells is to build a living cell with the least amount of parts and complexity. Artificial cells hold great potential for several applications, including membrane protein interactions, gene expression, biomaterials, and drug development. It is critical to generate robust, stable artificial cells using high throughput, easy-to-control, and flexible techniques. Recently, droplet-based microfluidic techniques have shown great potential for the synthesis of vesicles and artificial cells. Here, we summarized the recent advances in droplet-based microfluidic techniques for the fabrication of vesicles and artificial cells. We first reviewed the different types of droplet-based microfluidic devices, including flow-focusing, T-junction, and coflowing. Next, we discussed the formation of multi-compartmental vesicles and artificial cells based on droplet-based microfluidics. The applications of artificial cells for studying gene expression dynamics, artificial cell-cell communications, and mechanobiology are highlighted and discussed. Finally, the current challenges and future outlook of droplet-based microfluidic methods for engineering artificial cells are discussed. This review will provide insights into scientific research in synthetic biology, microfluidic devices, membrane interactions, and mechanobiology.

TI Tuning PYTHIA for forward physics experiments
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D

DT Article
ID PROTON-PROTON COLLISIONS; TEV
AB Event generators like PYTHIA play an important role in physics studies at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). While they make accurate predictions in the central region, i.e., at pseudorapidities eta < 5, a disagreement between PYTHIA and measurements in the forward region eta > 7 has been observed. We introduce a dedicated forward physics tune for the PYTHIA event generator to be used for forward physics studies at the LHC, which uses a more flexible modeling of beam remnant hadronization and is tuned to available particle spectra measured by LHCf. Furthermore, we provide an uncertainty estimate on the new tune in a data-driven way which can be used as a means of flux uncertainty for future forward physics studies. We demonstrate an application of our tune by showing the updated neutrino and dark photon spectra at the FASER experiment.

AB Although hydropower produces a relatively small portion of the electricity we use in the United States, it is a flexible and dispatchable resource that serves various critical functions for managing the electricity grid. Climate-induced changes to water availability will affect future hydropower production, and such changes could impact how the areas where the supply and demand of electricity are balanced, called balancing authority areas, are able to meet decarbonization goals. We calculate hydroclimate risk to hydropower at the balancing authority scale, which is previously underexplored in the literature and has real implications for decarbonization and resilience-building. Our results show that, by 2050, most balancing authority areas could experience significant changes in water availability in areas where they have hydropower. Balancing areas facing the greatest changes are located in diverse geographic areas, not just the Western and Northwestern United States, and vary in hydropower generation capacity. The range of projected changes experienced within each balancing area could exacerbate or offset existing hydropower generation deficits. As power producers and managers undertake increasing regional cooperation to account for introducing more variable renewable energy into the grid, analysis of risk at this regional scale will become increasingly salient.

AB Violet phosphorus (VP) is garnering attention for its appealing physical properties and potential applications in optoelectronics. A comprehensive investigation of the photodegradation and thermal effects of exfoliated VP on SiO2/Si substrates is presented. The degradation rate of VP is strongly influenced by the wavelength and exposure duration of light. Light illumination of VP above the bandgap leads to faster degradation, attributed to interactions with reactive oxygen species. Power-dependent photoluminescence (PL) measurements at low temperature (T = 4 K) show neutral exciton (X0) and trion (T) intensities linearly increase with excitation power, while the energy difference between peak energies decreases. The T/X0 spectral weight ratio increases from 0.28 at 300 K to 0.69 at 4 K, suggesting enhanced T formation due to reduced phonon scattering. Temperature-dependent Raman is used to investigate the phonon properties of VP. Tracking peak positions of 9 Raman modes with temperature, the linear first-order temperature coefficient is obtained and found to be linear for all modes. The results provide a deeper understanding of VP's degradation behavior and implications for optoelectronic applications.
   A comprehensive study of the photo-degradation and thermal effects of exfoliated Violet Phosphorus (VP) is investigated. It is shown that the wavelength and exposure duration of light strongly influences the degradation rate of VP. Photoluminescence spectroscopy is performed as a function of time, power, and temperature to understand the effect of degradation on exciton emissions. Temperature-dependent Raman is used to investigate the phonon properties of VP.image

ID GRAVITATIONAL-WAVES; STABILITY
AB After black holes collide, the remnant settles to a stationary state by emitting gravitational waves. Once nonlinearities subside, these ringdown waves are dominated by exponentially damped sinusoids, or quasinormal modes. We develop a general method using perturbative spectral expansions to calculate the quasinormal-mode frequencies and damping times in a wide class of modified gravity theories for black holes with any subextremal spin. We apply this method to scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity to show its accuracy, thus enabling robust ringdown tests with gravitational wave data.

AB In many clades in the Tree of Life, nucleotide substitution rates and base frequencies are hypothesized to have changed as genome evolution unfolded over time. Rigorous testing of this hypothesis relies on accurate phylogenetic reconstruction under suitable models of biomolecular sequence evolution. By far the most common approach for phylogenetic reconstruction is a "two-phase" analysis, where unaligned biomolecular sequence data are first aligned, and the resulting multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is used as input to downstream phylogenetic reconstruction. For a traditional "homogeneous" substitution model that is fixed across a species phylogeny, it has long been established that accurate phylogenetic inference and learning requires accurate upstream multiple sequence alignments. But the same question has not been carefully studied for "heterogeneous" models of substitution processes that can vary across the branches of a phylogeny.
   We therefore conducted a comprehensive performance study to quantify the impact of upstream MSA estimation error on downstream phylogenetic inference and learning under branch-variable models of nucleotide substitution. Across model conditions with either 10 or 20 taxa and spanning a range of evolutionary divergence, we find a consistent and significantly positive association between upstream and downstream estimation error. The relationship is robust to the choice of MSA estimation method as well as substitution model mis-specification. We further quantify the relatively large contribution of upstream MSA estimation error to downstream phylogenetic reconstruction quality, compared to other experimental factors. We also conducted an empirical study of flowering monocots. Phylogenetic analyses of orthologous genes in the clade confirm the simulation study findings, and species tree estimation using branch-variable substitution models reveals new insights into sequence evolution heterogeneity. Our findings underscore several key gaps in the state of the art, including the need for MSA-aware phylogenetic inference and learning methods under heterogeneous models of sequence evolution.
   To this end, we introduce a new computational method, NoHTS ("Non-Homogeneous Tree Support"), to directly assess phylogenetic estimation uncertainty due to MSA estimation error and other factors. The newmethod uses sequence-aware statistical resampling to place confidence intervals on a phylogeny estimated under a branch-variable substitution model. We demonstrate its superior type I and type II error versus a de facto standard in phylogenetic and phylogenomic studies - the phylogenetic bootstrap method.

AB Microbial communities that maintain symbiotic relationships with animals evolve by adapting to the specific environmental niche provided by their host, yet understanding their patterns of speciation remains challenging. Whether bacterial speciation occurs primarily through allopatric or sympatric processes remains an open question. In addition, patterns of DNA transfers, which are pervasive in bacteria, are more constrained in a closed host-gut system. Eusocial bees have co-evolved with their specialized microbiota for over 85 million years, constituting a simple and valuable system to study the complex dynamics of host-associated microbial interactions. Here, we studied the patterns of speciation and evolution of seven specialized gut bacteria from three clades of eusocial bee species: western honey bees, eastern honey bees, and bumblebees. We conducted genomic analyses to infer species delineation relative to the patterns of homologous recombination (HR), and horizontal gene transfer (HGT). The studied bacteria presented various modes of evolution and speciation relative to their hosts, but some trends were consistent across all of them. We observed a clear interruption of HR between bacteria inhabiting different bee hosts, which is consistent with a mechanism of allopatric speciation, but we also identified interruptions of HR within hosts, suggesting recent or ongoing sympatric speciation. In contrast to HR, we observed that HGT events were not constrained by species borders. Overall, our findings show that in host-associated bacterial populations, patterns of HR and HGT have different impacts on speciation patterns, which are driven by both allopatric and sympatric speciation processes.

AB We synthesize and study the charge transfer properties of a oligosilyl coordination polymer formed from zirconium clusters. Although the product lacks long range order, spectroscopic and computational evidence suggest that the metal-ligand bond is formed, and the principle crystallographic reflections closely match those simulated from inter-node spacings matching that of the ligand. The porous polymer allows for the incorporation of guest molecules as demonstrated by the intercalation of 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ). Charge transfer is predicted from DFT and experimentally observed by infrared spectroscopy, solid-state 29Si nuclear magnetic spectroscopy, and voltammetry.
   A disordered zirconium-oligosilyl coordination polymer exhibits coordination-dependent charge transfer.

AB Observing 3D magnetic fields, including orientation and strength, within the interstellar medium is vital but notoriously difficult. However, recent advances in our understanding of anisotropic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence demonstrate that MHD turbulence and 3D magnetic fields leave their imprints on the intensity features of spectroscopic observations. Leveraging these theoretical frameworks, we propose a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to extract this embedded information, enabling the probe of 3D magnetic fields. This model examines the plane-of-the-sky magnetic field orientation (phi), the magnetic field's inclination angle (gamma) relative to the line-of-sight, and the total magnetization level (MA-1) of the cloud. We train the model using synthetic emission lines of (CO)-C-13 (J = 1-0) and (CO)-O-18 (J = 1-0), generated from 3D MHD simulations that span conditions from sub-Alfv & eacute;nic to super-Alfv & eacute;nic molecular clouds. Our tests confirm that the CNN model effectively reconstructs the 3D magnetic field topology and magnetization. The median uncertainties are under 5 degrees for both phi and gamma, and less than 0.2 for M-A in sub-Alfv & eacute;nic conditions (M-A approximate to 0.5). In super-Alfv & eacute;nic scenarios (M-A approximate to 2.0), they are under 15 degrees for phi and gamma, and 1.5 for M-A. We applied this trained CNN model to the L1478 molecular cloud. Results show a strong agreement between the CNN-predicted magnetic field orientation and that derived from Planck 353 GHz polarization. The CNN approach enabled us to construct the 3D magnetic field map for L1478, revealing a global inclination angle of approximate to 76 degrees and a global M-A of approximate to 1.07.

DE Oblivious routing; reconfigurable networks; tail inequalities; valiant
   load balancin
ID INTERCONNECTION; OPTIMALITY
AB In a landmark 1981 paper, Valiant and Brebner gave birth to the study of oblivious routing and, simultaneously, introduced its most powerful and ubiquitous method: Valiant load balancing (VLB). By routing messages through a randomly sampled intermediate node, VLB lengthens routing paths by a factor of two but gains the crucial property of obliviousness: it balances load in a completely decentralized manner, with no global knowledge of the communication pattern. Forty years later, with datacenters handling workloads whose communication pattern varies too rapidly to allow centralized coordination, oblivious routing is as relevant as ever, and VLB continues to take center stage as a widely used - and in some settings, provably optimal - way to balance load in the network obliviously to the traffic demands. However, the ability of the network to rapidly reconfigure its interconnection topology gives rise to new possibilities.
   In this work we revisit the question of whether VLB remains optimal in the novel setting of reconfigurable networks. Prior work showed that VLB achieves the optimal tradeoff between latency and guaranteed throughput. In this work we show that a strictly superior latency-throughput tradeoff is achievable when the throughput bound is relaxed to hold with high probability. The same improved tradeoff is also achievable with guaranteed throughput under time-stationary demands, provided the latency bound is relaxed to hold with high probability and that the network is allowed to be semioblivious, using an oblivious (randomized) connection schedule but demand-aware routing. We prove that the latter result is not achievable by any fully-oblivious reconfigurable network design, marking a rare case in which semi-oblivious routing has a provable asymptotic advantage over oblivious routing. Our results are enabled by a novel oblivious routing scheme that improves VLB by stretching routing paths the minimum possible amount - an additive stretch of 1 rather than a multiplicative stretch of 2 - yet still manages to balance load with high probability when either the traffic demand matrix or the network's interconnection schedule are shuffled by a uniformly random permutation. To analyze our routing scheme we prove an exponential tail bound which may be of independent interest, concerning the distribution of values of a bilinear form on an orbit of a permutation group action.

AB Existing research has consistently supported a relationship between creative achievement and specific personality traits (e.g. openness to experience). However, such work has largely focused on univariate associations, potentially obscuring complex interactions among multiple personality factors, rendering an incomplete picture of the creative personality. We applied a psychometric network approach to characterize the multidimensional personality structure of highly creative individuals in the arts ("artists") and sciences ("scientists"), using data from three samples (N = 4,015): college students, a representative adult sample, and the Big-C project of eminent creative professionals. Replicating past work, we found that artists showed reliably higher levels of openness to experience compared to scientists and a control group of less creative people. Psychometric network analysis revealed that artists were characterized by higher connectivity (i.e. co-occurrence) with other personality traits for openness, indicating that openness may be more heterogeneous in how it co-occurs with other personality traits in highly creative people. Across all three samples, we found that the scientists' personality network structure was more cohesive than the personality network of artists and the control group, indicating greater homogeneity in the personality characteristics of scientists. Our findings uncover a constellation of traits that give rise to creative achievement in the arts and sciences.

AB Many-body effects play an important role in enhancing and modifying optical absorption and other excited-state properties of solids in the perturbative regime, but their role in high harmonic generation (HHG) and other nonlinear response beyond the perturbative regime is not well-understood. We develop here an ab initio many-body method to study nonperturbative HHG based on the real-time propagation of the non-equilibrium Green's function with the GW self energy. We calculate the HHG of monolayer MoS2 and obtain good agreement with experiment, including the reproduction of characteristic patterns of monotonic and nonmonotonic harmonic yield in the parallel and perpendicular responses, respectively. Here, we show that many-body effects are especially important to accurately reproduce the spectral features in the perpendicular response, which reflect a complex interplay of electron-hole interactions (or exciton effects) in tandem with the many-body renormalization and Berry curvature of the independent quasiparticle bandstructure.

SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B

DT Article
ID MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; POTENTIALS; WATER
AB We address the challenge of representativity and dynamical consistency when unbonded fine-grained particles are collected together into coarse-grained particles. We implement a hybrid procedure for identifying and tracking the underlying fine-grained particles & horbar;e.g., atoms or molecules & horbar;by exchanging them between the coarse-grained particles periodically at a characteristic time. The exchange involves a back-mapping of the coarse-grained particles into fine-grained particles and a subsequent reassignment to coarse-grained particles conserving total mass and momentum. We find that an appropriate choice of the characteristic exchange time can lead to the correct effective diffusion rate of the fine-grained particles when simulated in hybrid coarse-grained dynamics. In the compressed (supercritical) fluid regime, without the exchange term, fine-grained particles remain associated with a given coarse-grained particle, leading to substantially lower diffusion rates than seen in all-atom molecular dynamics of the fine-grained particles. Thus, this work confirms the need for addressing the representativity of fine-grained particles within coarse-grained particles and offers a simple exchange mechanism so as to retain dynamical consistency between the fine- and coarse-grained scales.

AB We synthesized single crystals for Mn2-xZnxSb (0 <= x <= 1) and studied their magnetic and electronic transport properties. This material system displays rich magnetic phase tunable with temperature and Zn composition. In addition, two groups of distinct magnetic and electronic properties, separated by a critical Zn composition of x = 0.6, are discovered. The Zn-less samples are metallic and characterized by a resistivity jump at the magnetic ordering temperature, while the Zn-rich samples lose metallicity and show a metal-to-insulator transition-like feature tunable by magnetic field. Our findings establish Mn2-xZnxSb as a promising material platform that offers opportunities to study how the coupling of spin, charge, and lattice degrees of freedom governs interesting transport properties in 2D magnets, which is currently a topic of broad interest.

AB We compute the 2-adic effective slice spectral sequence (ESSS) for the motivic stable homotopy groups of.., a motivic analogue of the connective.. (1)-local sphere over prime fields of characteristic not two. Together with the analogous computation over algebraically closed fields, this yields information about the motivic.. (1)local sphere over arbitrary base fields of characteristic not two. To compute the spectral sequence, we prove several results that may be of independent interest. We describe the.. 1-differentials in the slice spectral sequence in terms of the motivic Steenrod operations over general base fields, building on analogous results of Ananyevskiy, Rondigs, and Ostvaer for the very effective cover of Hermitian K-theory. We also explicitly describe the coefficients of certain motivic Eilenberg-MacLane spectra and compute the ESSS for the very effective cover of Hermitian K-theory over prime fields.

AB Fabricating polymeric composites with desirable characteristics for electronic applications is a complex and costly process. Digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing emerges as a promising technique for manufacturing intricate structures. In this study, polymeric samples are fabricated with a conductivity difference exceeding three orders of magnitude in various portions of a part by employing grayscale DLP (g-DLP) single-vat single-cure 3D printing deliberate resin design. This is realized through the manipulation of light intensity during the curing process. Specifically, the rational resin design with added lithium ions results in the polymer cured under the maximum UV-light intensity exhibiting higher electrical resistance. Conversely, sections that are only partially cured retains uncured monomers, serving as a medium that facilitates ion mobility, consequently leading to higher conductivity. The versatility of g-DLP allows precise control of light intensity in different regions during the printing process. This characteristic opens up possibilities for applications, notably the low-cost, facile, and rapid production of complex electrical circuits and sensors. The utilization of this technique makes it feasible to fabricate materials with tailored conductivity and functionality, providing an innovative pathway to advance the accelerated and facile creation of sophisticated electronic devices.

ID SOCIAL MEDIA
AB Social media platforms are highly interconnected because many users maintain a presence across multiple platforms. Consequently, efforts to limit the spread of misinformation taken by individual platforms can have complex consequences on misinformation diffusion across the social media ecosystem. This is further complicated by the diverse social structures, platform standards, and moderation mechanisms provided on each platform. We study this issue by extending our previous model of Reddit interactions and community-specific moderation measures. By adding a followership-based model of Twitter interactions and facilitating cross-platform user participation, we simulate information diffusion across heterogeneous social media platforms. While incorporating platform-specific moderation mechanisms, we simulate interactions at the user level and specify user-specific attributes. This allows practitioners to conduct experiments with various types of actors and different combinations of moderation. We show how the model can simulate the impacts of such features on discussions facilitated by Reddit and Twitter and the cross-platform spread of misinformation. To validate this model, we use a combination of empirical datasets from three U.S. political events and prior findings from user surveys and studies.

AB Nanostructured manganese oxides (MnOx) have shown incredible promise in constructing next-generation energy storage and catalytic systems. However, it has proven challenging to integrate with other low-dimensional materials due to harsh deposition conditions and poor structural stability. Here, we report the deposition of layered manganese dioxide (delta-MnO2) on bilayer epitaxial graphene (QEG) using a simple three-step electrochemical process involving no harsh chemicals. Using this process we can synthesize a 50 nm thick H-MnO2 film in 1.25s. This synthetic birnessite is inherently water-stabilized, the first reported in the literature. We also confirm that this process does not cause structural damage to the QEG, as evidenced by the lack of D peak formation. This QEG heterostructure enhanced MnO2's redox active gas sensing, enabling room temperature detection of NH3 and NO2. We also report on transforming this delta-MnO2 to other MnOx compounds, Mn2O3 and Mn3O4, via mild annealing. This is confirmed by Raman spectroscopy of the films, which also confirms limited damage to the QEG substrate. To our knowledge, this is the first synthesis of Mn2O3 and Mn3O4 on pristine graphene substrates. Both methods demonstrate the potential of depositing and transforming multifunctional oxides on single-crystal graphene using QEG substrates, allowing for the formation of nanostructured heterostructures previously unseen. Additionally, the electrochemical nature of the deposition presents the ability to scale the process to the QEG wafer and adjust the solution to produce other powerful multifunctional oxides.

DE health risk prediction; diffusion model; EHR data augmentation
AB Health risk prediction aims to forecast the potential health risks that patients may face using their historical Electronic Health Records (EHR). Although several effective models have developed, data insufficiency is a key issue undermining their effectiveness. Various data generation and augmentation methods have been introduced to mitigate this issue by expanding the size of the training data set through learning underlying data distributions. However, the performance of these methods is often limited due to their task-unrelated design. To address these shortcomings, this paper introduces a novel, end-to-end diffusion-based risk prediction model, named MedDiffusion. It enhances risk prediction performance by creating synthetic patient data during training to enlarge sample space. Furthermore, MedDiffusion discerns hidden relationships between patient visits using a step-wise attention mechanism, enabling the model to automatically retain the most vital information for generating high-quality data. Experimental evaluation on four real-world medical datasets demonstrates that MedDiffusion outperforms 14 cutting-edge baselines in terms of PR-AUC, F1, and Cohen's Kappa. We also conduct ablation studies and benchmark our model against GAN-based alternatives to further validate the rationality and adaptability of our model design. Additionally, we analyze generated data to offer fresh insights into the model's interpretability. The source code is available via https://shorturl.at/aerT0.

AB Carbon-based nanofibers are critical materials with broad applications in industries such as energy, filtration, and biomedical devices. Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) is a primary precursor for carbon nanofibers, but conventional electrospinning techniques typically operate at low production rates of 0.1-1 mL/h from a single spinneret, limiting scalability. In this study, we introduce a novel liquid-assisted ultrahigh-speed electrospinning (LAUHS-ES) technique that achieved actual production rates over 220 times faster than conventional methods. This dramatic increase in throughput is achieved through Taylor cone stabilization using a thin layer of liquid sheath, allowing for ultrahigh-speed electrospinning without compromising the structural integrity or uniformity of the nanofibers. Comprehensive characterization, including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD), confirmed the high quality, consistency, and crystallinity of the produced nanofibers. Our results demonstrate that PAN nanofiber fabrication can be scaled up significantly while maintaining precise control over fiber morphology and performance. This advancement holds substantial promise for large-scale industrial applications, enabling more efficient and cost-effective production of carbon-based nanofibers.

TI Neural approximation of Wasserstein distance via a universal

AB Learning distance functions between complex objects, such as the Wasserstein distance to compare point sets, is a common goal in machine learning applications. However, functions on such complex objects (e.g., point sets and graphs) are often required to be invariant to a wide variety of group actions e.g. permutation or rigid transformation. Therefore, continuous and symmetric product functions (such as distance functions) on such complex objects must also be invariant to the product of such group actions. We call these functions symmetric and factor-wise group invariant functions (or SFGI functions in short). In this paper, we first present a general neural network architecture for approximating SFGI functions. The main contribution of this paper combines this general neural network with a sketching idea to develop a specific and efficient neural network which can approximate the p-th Wasserstein distance between point sets. Very importantly, the required model complexity is independent of the sizes of input point sets. On the theoretical front, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first result showing that there exists a neural network with the capacity to approximate Wasserstein distance with bounded model complexity. Our work provides an interesting integration of sketching ideas for geometric problems with universal approximation of symmetric functions. On the empirical front, we present a range of results showing that our newly proposed neural network architecture performs comparatively or better than other models (including a SOTA Siamese Autoencoder based approach). In particular, our neural network generalizes significantly better and trains much faster than the SOTA Siamese AE. Finally, this line of investigation could be useful in exploring effective neural network design for solving a broad range of geometric optimization problems (e.g., k-means in a metric space).

ID ALUMINUM-ALLOY; BEHAVIOR
AB In this study, we investigated the effects of laser shock peening (LSP) on the corrosion resistance of lightweight metal alloys, specifically AA6061 and AZ31. LSP was performed underwater, using a nanosecond pulse laser and without using a protective coating or layer on the workpiece. The corrosion behaviors of these alloys were analyzed through electrochemical tests, including open circuit potential, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and potentiodynamic polarization measurements. The results demonstrated that LSP significantly improved the polarization resistance, and higher laser power intensities led to increased corrosion resistance and reduced corrosion rates. This enhancement in anti-corrosion performance is attributed to the formation of a protective oxide layer on the surface, acting as a barrier against corrosion. The findings underscore the potential of laser surface treatment as a viable technique for enhancing the corrosion resistance of lightweight metal alloys.

TI High temperature stability of entropy-stabilized oxide
   (MgCoNiCuZn)<sub>0.2</sub>O in air
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
ID SOLID-SOLUTIONS; ZNO SYSTEM; ALLOYS
AB Entropy-stabilized oxides are single-phase, multicomponent oxides that are stabilized by a large entropy of mixing, Delta S, overcoming a positive enthalpy. Due to the -T Delta S term in the Gibbs' free energy, G, it can be hypothesized that entropy-stabilized oxides demonstrate a robust thermal stability. Here, we investigate the high temperature stability (1300-1700 degrees C) of the prototypical entropy-stabilized rocksalt oxide (MgCoNiCuZn)(0.2)O in air. We find that at temperatures >1300 degrees C, the material gradually loses Cu and Zn with increasing temperature. Cu is lost through a selective melting as a Cu-rich liquid phase is formed. Zn is sublimed from the rocksalt phase at approximately similar temperatures to those corresponding to the Cu loss, significantly below both the melting temperature of ZnO and its solubility limit in a rocksalt phase. The elemental loss progressively reduces the entropy of mixing and results in a multiphase solid upon quenching to room temperature. We posit that the high-temperature solubility of Cu and Zn is correlated providing further evidence for entropic stabilization over general solubility arguments. (c) 2024 Author(s).

AB Sufficiently energetic breaking ocean waves produce distinctive visible foam signatures on the water surface called whitecaps. The mixture of surface whitecap foam cells, and sub-surface bubbles, results in the broad-band scattering of light that allow whitecaps to be measured with optical cameras. In this paper the temporal evolution of whitecap foam area from laboratory and oceanic breaking waves is compared. When appropriately scaled, the foam area time series for both laboratory and oceanic breaking waves follow similar trends, despite occurring in vastly different settings. Distinct similarities of the signature of foam stabilization due to the presence of surfactants in the controlled laboratory experiments are also found in the field suggesting foam stabilization may be a means to remotely sense the presence/absence or concentration of surfactants in the ocean. In addition, probability density distributions of key whitecap variables such as foam area growth and decay timescales and maximum foam area are compared between laboratory and oceanic whitecaps. The oceanic whitecaps are much larger in scale than the laboratory breaking waves, whereas the whitecap growth and decay timescales are similar in magnitude, the latter suggesting that the depths to which bubbles are injected during active air entrainment in the field are relatively shallow. The aggregated whitecap statistics are used to estimate the energy dissipation of individual whitecaps in a novel manner.
   The breaking of ocean waves is a key process controlling the evolution of oceanic sea states and the exchange of energy, momentum and material across the ocean-atmosphere interface. Despite their importance, little is known about the energetics of individual breaking waves in the ocean because of the difficulty in precisely measuring the complicated fluid motions they produce. However, when they are sufficiently energetic, they entrain air and appear as white foam patches on the water surface, and are called whitecaps. This means that their occurrence and scale can be measured using relatively affordable optical cameras. In this paper we show that the patterns of foam evolution in laboratory breaking waves and oceanic whitecaps are remarkably similar giving us confidence that what we learn from laboratory experiments can be confidently applied to real oceanic whitecaps. Building on this, we show what parts of the whitecap foam area evolution can be used to learn more about ocean chemistry and breaking wave energetics. We hope that further development of the principles outlined in this paper can transform how oceanic whitecaps are observed in the ocean and ultimately lead to a better understanding of ocean waves and their evolution.

AB CycleGAN, a deep learning model for image conversion tasks is an extension of the Pix2Pix architecture [1] offering cycle consistency loss that offers image-to-image translation where you have two sets of images from different domains. Through deep learning in this way, it can generate high-quality and diverse image transformation results, which are widely used in the fields of style transfer, and domain adaptation. With generative AI taking center stage, the underlying principles of CycleGAN are used extensively across several domains including geospatial analysis. In this study we explore the potential of additional geospatial derivatives that when used can have the potential to enhance CycleGAN's domain adaptation. The analysis focuses on integrating digital surface model and NDVI to enhance image translation accuracy, maintain content integrity, and optimize CycleGAN for practical applications. Our results show that combining these two with multispectral bands yields better outcomes than isolating them from the training process, highlighting the effectiveness of this synergistic approach.

AB Sorption-enhanced catalysts are bifunctional materials consisting of a heterogeneous catalyst affixed to a solid sorbent with a combined capacity to selectively capture and convert CO2 directly to value-added fuels and chemicals in the same reactor. The benefits of facile separation of CO2, directly from air or from flue gas, and conversion to chemical commodities is appealing for developing an integrated carbon capture and utilization scheme. The growth of this area is rapidly expanding with interest from catalysis, materials design, and life-cycle analysis researchers. However, the promise of sorption-enhanced catalysts is limited by their reduced thermal stability, CO2 capture capacity, and restricted product streams to C-1 hydrocarbons. The prime issue is that the reaction conditions for the capture of CO2, regeneration of the sorbent, and utilization can be vastly different. It remains a challenge to optimize both the properties of the sorbent support material and the heterogeneous catalyst used. This perspective summarizes the current state-of-the-art for the properties of solid sorbents, heterogeneous catalysts, and the combined sorbent-enhanced catalysts for producing hydrocarbons from CO2. Lastly, the perspective discusses challenges and future areas for improving the performance and capture efficiency of sorption-enhanced catalysts.

AB Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) are considered a keystone species for higher trophic level predators along the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) during the austral summer. The connectivity of krill may play a critical role in predator biogeography, especially for central-place foragers such as the Pygoscelis spp. penguins that breed along the WAP during the austral summer. Antarctic krill are also heavily fished commercially; therefore, understanding population connectivity of krill is critical to effective management. Here, we used a physical ocean model to examine adult krill connectivity in this region using simulated krill with realistic diel vertical migration behaviors across four austral summers. Our results indicate that krill north and south of Low Island and the southern Bransfield Strait are nearly isolated from each other and that persistent current features play a role in this lack of inter-region connectivity. Transit and entrainment times were not correlated with penguin populations at the large spatial scales examined. However, long transit times and reduced entrainment correlate spatially with the areas where krill fishing is most intense, which heightens the risk that krill fishing may lead to limited krill availability for predators.

ID HOMOLOGY
AB Topological data analysis (TDA) is gaining prominence across a wide spectrum of machine learning tasks that spans from manifold learning to graph classification. A pivotal technique within TDA is persistent homology (PH), which furnishes an exclusive topological imprint of data by tracing the evolution of latent structures as a scale parameter changes. Present PH tools are confined to analyzing data through a single filter parameter. However, many scenarios necessitate the consideration of multiple relevant parameters to attain finer insights into the data. We address this issue by introducing the Effective Multidimensional Persistence (EMP) framework. This framework empowers the exploration of data by simultaneously varying multiple scale parameters. The framework integrates descriptor functions into the analysis process, yielding a highly expressive data summary. It seamlessly integrates established single PH summaries into multidimensional counterparts like EMP Landscapes, Silhouettes, Images, and Surfaces. These summaries represent data's multidimensional aspects as matrices and arrays, aligning effectively with diverse ML models. We provide theoretical guarantees and stability proofs for EMP summaries. We demonstrate EMP's utility in graph classification tasks, showing its effectiveness. Results reveal that EMP enhances various single PH descriptors, outperforming cutting-edge methods on multiple benchmark datasets.

AB Density functional theory (DFT) modeling has been useful to electrocatalyst research, yet simulating the complexities of the electrode-electrolyte interface hinders progress in understanding reaction mechanisms and the underlying kinetics. Though many approaches to incorporating electrochemical double layer (EDL) features in DFT calculations have been developed, uncertainty in interfacial solvent properties and the distribution of ions leave the impact of the EDL on electrocatalytic kinetics unclear. Elucidating the sensitivity of DFT predictions to the EDL properties and model is crucial. Herein, we use an analytical Grand Canonical DFT framework (aGC-DFT) to quantify the sensitivity of potential-dependent activation energies to parameters of the EDL, incorporating a Helmholtz EDL model with varying dielectric constant (epsilon(r)) and EDL width (d). We compute the activation barriers for OC-H, CO-H, and OC-CO bond formation from CO* on Cu. These elementary reactions are critical within the heavily debated reaction mechanism of CO2 reduction and are likely to impact overall activity and product selectivity. We show the aGC-DFT method produces consistent results with explicit GC-DFT calculations, while enabling probing of the EDL model sensitivity at a much lower computational cost. Reaction steps with significant dipole moment changes (i.e., CO-H bond formation) are highly sensitive to the chosen EDL parameters, such that the relative barriers of the OC-H, CO-H, and OC-CO bond formation steps depend significantly on EDL properties. Without knowledge of the interfacial properties of the EDL, there is substantial uncertainty in activation barriers and elementary reaction rates within a DFT analysis of electrocatalytic kinetics.

AB As they process complex linguistic input, language comprehenders must maintain a mapping between lexical items (e.g., morphemes) and their syntactic position in the sentence. We propose a model of how these morpheme-position bindings are encoded, maintained, and reaccessed in working memory, based on working memory models such as "serial-order-in-a-box" and its SOB-Complex Span version. Like those models, our model of linguistic working memory derives a range of attested memory interference effects from the process of binding items to positions in working memory. We present simulation results capturing similarity-based interference as well as item distortion effects. Our model provides a unified account of these two major classes of interference effects in sentence processing, attributing both types of effects to an associative memory architecture underpinning linguistic computation.

AB Ethyl cellulose (EC) is a biocompatible, renewable, and recyclable material with diverse sources, making it an attractive candidate for industrial applications. Electrospinning has gained significant attention for the production of EC fibers. However, conventional electrospinning methods face challenges such as bead formation, low yield, and the absence of porous internal structures, limiting both the functional performance and scalability. This study presents an optimized approach for producing EC fibers by using a gravity-driven ultrahigh-speed electrospinning (GUHS-ES) system. This system leverages gravity to reshape the Taylor cone morphology during electrospinning, enhancing stability and dramatically increasing throughput. As flow rates increase, the Taylor cone contracts inward, while the tip structure expands and stabilizes, reaching maximum size at ultrahigh flow rates (100-150 mL/h). This unique Taylor cone structure enables a fiber production rate of 24.5 g/h, hundreds of times greater than conventional electrospinning techniques. Another advantage of the GUHS-ES system is its ability to achieve both high diameter uniformity and adjustable porosity. At ultrahigh flow rates, the pore sizes of the EC fibers reached 321 nm. The highly porous structure of EC fibers exhibited an absorption capacity of 56.6 to 110.7 times their weight, exceeding most previously reported oil-absorbing materials and demonstrating high efficacy for rapid waste oil absorption. This green, efficient technology represents a promising advancement for the large-scale production and application of natural polymer fibers with broad implications for sustainable industrial processes.

AB Neutron stars have solid crusts threaded by strong magnetic fields. Perturbations in the crust can excite nonradial oscillations, which can in turn launch Alfv & eacute;n waves into the magnetosphere. In the case of a compact binary close to merger involving at least one neutron star, this can happen through tidal interactions causing resonant excitations that shatter the neutron star crust. We present the first numerical study that elucidates the dynamics of Alfv & eacute;n waves launched in a compact binary magnetosphere. We seed a magnetic field perturbation on the neutron star crust, which we then evolve in fully general-relativistic force-free electrodynamics using a GPU-based implementation. We show that Alfv & eacute;n waves steepen nonlinearly before reaching the orbital light cylinder, form flares, and dissipate energy in a transient current sheet. Our results predict radio and X-ray precursor emission from this process.

AB Twenty years ago, this journal published a review entitled "Biofabrication with Chitosan" based on the observations that (i) chitosan could be electrodeposited using low voltage electrical inputs (typically less than 5 V) and (ii) the enzyme tyrosinase could be used to graft proteins (via accessible tyrosine residues) to chitosan. Here, we provide a progress report on the coupling of electronic inputs with advanced biological methods for the fabrication of biopolymer-based hydrogel films. In many cases, the initial observations of chitosan's electrodeposition have been extended and generalized: mechanisms have been established for the electrodeposition of various other biological polymers (proteins and polysaccharides), and electrodeposition has been shown to allow the precise control of the hydrogel's emergent microstructure. In addition, the use of biotechnological methods to confer function has been extended from tyrosinase conjugation to the use of protein engineering to create genetically fused assembly tags (short sequences of accessible amino acid residues) that facilitate the attachment of function-conferring proteins to electrodeposited films using alternative enzymes (e.g., transglutaminase), metal chelation, and electrochemically induced oxidative mechanisms. Over these 20 years, the contributions from numerous groups have also identified exciting opportunities. First, electrochemistry provides unique capabilities to impose chemical and electrical cues that can induce assembly while controlling the emergent microstructure. Second, it is clear that the detailed mechanisms of biopolymer self-assembly (i.e., chitosan gel formation) are far more complex than anticipated, and this provides a rich opportunity both for fundamental inquiry and for the creation of high performance and sustainable material systems. Third, the mild conditions used for electrodeposition allow cells to be co-deposited for the fabrication of living materials. Finally, the applications have been expanded from biosensing and lab-on-a-chip systems to bioelectronic and medical materials. We suggest that electro-biofabrication is poised to emerge as an enabling additive manufacturing method especially suited for life science applications and to bridge communication between our biological and technological worlds.

AB The task of few-shot graph classification aims to assign class labels to graph samples, where only a limited number of labeled graphs are provided for each class. To deal with the problem brought about by label scarcity, recent works have focused on adopting the prevalent few-shot learning framework to ensure fast adaptations to classes with limited labeled graphs. In general, these studies propose to accumulate meta-knowledge across various base classes with sufficient labeled graphs, and then generalize such meta-knowledge to novel classes, which are disjoint from base classes and consist of limited labeled graphs. However, existing studies generally ignore the distinct distribution shifts between base classes and novel classes, leading to unsatisfactory adaptation performance. On the other hand, it remains challenging to address this issue due to the potential variance in distributions between classes. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel generative few-shot graph classification framework that can promote adaptation performance by generating adaptive structures for graphs in novel classes. Our framework incorporates a generative model to modify the graph structures for adaptation. We further conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our framework.

AB Class I myosins (myosin-Is) colocalize with Arp2/3 complex-nucleated actin networks at sites of membrane protrusion and invagination, but the mechanisms by which myosin-I motor activity coordinates with branched actin assembly to generate force are unknown. We mimicked the interplay of these proteins using the "comet tail" bead motility assay, where branched actin networks are nucleated by the Arp2/3 complex on the surface of beads coated with myosin-I and nucleation-promoting factor. We observed that myosin-I increased bead movement efficiency by thinning actin networks without affecting growth rates. Myosin-I triggered symmetry breaking and comet tail formation in dense networks resistant to spontaneous fracturing. Even with arrested actin assembly, myosin-I alone could break the network. Computational modeling recapitulated these observations, suggesting myosin-I acts as a repulsive force shaping the network's architecture and boosting its force-generating capacity. We propose that myosin-I leverages its power stroke to amplify the forces generated by Arp2/3 complex-nucleated actin networks.

AB Bone and teeth are comprised of carbonate-substituted apatites with cationic substitutions, like sodium and potassium. Cations substitute for calcium in the apatite lattice but it is unclear whether they substitute for Ca(1) or Ca(2). Additionally, although we know that anionic substitutions affect the mineral mechanics, it is unclear how cationic substitutions affect mineral stiffness. Here, a combined experimental and theoretical approach using in situ fluid-mediated hydrostatic loading with synchrotron Wide Angle X-ray Scattering (WAXS) and Density Functional Theory (DFT) is used to elucidate the role of CO32- and Na+ or K+ co-substitutions on the atomic structure and mechanics of biomimetic apatites. Comparison of WAXS and DFT results showed that preferential substitutions at the Ca(1) and Ca(2) sites depended on cationic type and concentration, with a preference for Ca(1) at higher levels of co-substitution. Substitution levels and location of the cationic substitution both significantly affected the modulus of the minerals. This presents a new paradigm for the development of biomimetic apatites with multi-property tunability by considering composition and atomic organization.

AB Data -driven computational analysis is becoming increasingly important in biomedical research, as the amount of data being generated continues to grow. However, the lack of practices of sharing research outputs, such as data, source code and methods, affects transparency and reproducibility of studies, which are critical to the advancement of science. Many published studies are not reproducible due to insuf fi cient documentation, code, and data being shared. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of 453 manuscripts published between 2016 - 2021 and found that 50.1% of them fail to share the analytical code. Even among those that did disclose their code, a vast majority failed to offer additional research outputs, such as data. Furthermore, only one in ten articles organized their code in a structured and reproducible manner. We discovered a signi fi cant association between the presence of code availability statements and increased code availability. Additionally, a greater proportion of studies conducting secondary analyses were inclined to share their code compared to those conducting primary analyses. In light of our fi ndings, we propose raising awareness of code sharing practices and taking immediate steps to enhance code availability to improve reproducibility in biomedical research. By increasing transparency and reproducibility, we can promote scienti fi c rigor, encourage collaboration, and accelerate scienti fi c discoveries. We must prioritize open science practices, including sharing code, data, and other research products, to ensure that biomedical research can be replicated and built upon by others in the scienti fi c community.

DE tensor factorization; electronic health records; PARAFAC2; multi-task
   learning
AB Tensor factorization has received increasing interest due to its intrinsic ability to capture latent factors in multi-dimensional data with many applications including Electronic Health Records (EHR) mining. PARAFAC2 and its variants have been proposed to address irregular tensors where one of the tensor modes is not aligned, e.g., different patients in EHRs may have different length of records. PARAFAC2 has been successfully applied to EHRs for extracting meaningful medical concepts (phenotypes). Despite recent advancements, current models' predictability and interpretability are not satisfactory, which limits its utility for downstream analysis. In this paper, we propose MULTIPAR: a supervised irregular tensor factorization with multi-task learning for computational phenotyping. MULTIPAR is flexible to incorporate both static (e.g. in-hospital mortality prediction) and continuous or dynamic (e.g. the need for ventilation) tasks. By supervising the tensor factorization with downstream prediction tasks and leveraging information from multiple related predictive tasks, MULTIPAR can yield not only more meaningful phenotypes but also better predictive performance for downstream tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world temporal EHR datasets to demonstrate that MULTIPAR is scalable and achieves better tensor fit with more meaningful subgroups and stronger predictive performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. The implementation of MULTIPAR is available(1).

AB Machine learning (ML) models in production pipelines are frequently retrained on the latest partitions of large, continually growing datasets. Due to engineering bugs, partitions in such datasets almost always have some corrupted features; thus, it's critical to find data issues and block retraining before downstream ML accuracy decreases. However, current ML data validation methods are difficult to operationalize: they yield too many false positive alerts, require manual tuning, or are infeasible at scale. In this paper, we present an automatic, precise, and scalable data validation system for ML pipelines, employing a simple idea that we call a Partition Summarization (PS) approach to data validation: each timestamp-based partition of data is summarized with data quality metrics, and summaries are compared to detect corrupted partitions. We demonstrate how to adapt PS for any data validation method in a robust manner and evaluate several adaptations-which by themselves provide limited precision. Finally, we present gate, our data validation method that leverages these adaptations, giving a 2.1x average improvement in precision over the baseline from prior work on a case study within our large tech company.

ID STABILITY
AB In the context of physical human-(tele)robot interaction, passivity-based stabilizers have been used to guarantee the physical or (tele)physical stability. In most of these examples, human biomechanics is considered an inherently passive system that dissipates energy. This assumption may not hold true when the interaction is implemented in the force-position domain, even though such a setting would be needed to boost positional accuracy and avoid the common kinematic drifts in the force-velocity domains. The aforementioned topic is examined in this paper using the concept of shortage versus excess of passivity index for human biomechanics in the force-position domain. We also investigate the compounding effect of the frequency of interaction. The outcomes of this paper will be imperative for the design of force-position domain pHRI stabilizers when the classical assumption of passivity of human biomechanics can lead to serious safety issues. In this work, for the first time, we quantitatively present the passivity margin and, thus, the energetic behavior of the human arm's biomechanics under various interaction scenarios in the Force-Position domain. The outcome of this work includes a three-dimensional passivity index map (3DPiM) that is validated on five healthy participants. The goal is to illustrate the passivity margin of the human upper limb biomechanics for two distinct levels of muscle co-contractions, as indicated by the Electromyography (EMG) signal, across four interaction frequencies and eight geometric directions. This outcome enables the future development of biomechanics-aware stabilizers in the force-position domain, quantifying the passivity margin in real-time and thus significantly reducing the stabilizer's conservatism while ensuring the safety of humanrobot interactions.

AB Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) alters the wireless channel by dynamically adjusting the propagation of wireless signals, thereby having the ability to enhance communication performance. Due to its low power consumption, IRS is expected to play an important role in improving energy efficiency (EE). In this paper, both optical IRS (OIRS) and radio frequency (RF) IRS are employed to assist aggregated visible light communication (VLC)-RF systems, and then a resource allocation algorithm is proposed to improve EE. To this end, a model for the IRS-assisted aggregated VLC-RF system is first established, followed by the formulated EE maximization problem. Furthermore, the EE maximization problem is decomposed into four subproblems, focusing on RF IRS configuration, optical subchannel assignment, OIRS arrangement, and joint power allocation. By employing block coordinate descent (BCD), the four subproblems are solved iteratively. Moreover, simulation results show the significant EE improvement brought by the IRS for aggregated VLC-RF systems. In addition, the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed BCD-based resource allocation algorithm, as well as the influence of key system parameters on EE are also demonstrated.

AB In the monolayer limit, 1T' WTe2 is a two-dimensional topological insulator exhibiting the quantum spin Hall effect and is believed to host an excitonic insulator ground state. However, theoretical analysis of this system is complicated by the difficulty of obtaining descriptions of the single-quasiparticle band structure consistent with experimental measurement within conventional first-principles techniques. Previous band-structure calculations using the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional and a one-shot GW approximation result in a semimetallic band structure, while calculations with hybrid functionals appear to open a band gap. Here, we demonstrate that self-consistently updating wave functions within a static GW approximation (static COHSEX) can reproduce the insulating band structure experimentally observed by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy without resorting to mechanisms beyond the quasiparticle picture. Finally, a finite-momentum Bethe-Salpeter equation calculation on top of self-consistent GW results in negative exciton excitation energies, leaving open the possibility of excitonic instability in 1T' monolayer WTe2.

TI Quasinormal mode frequencies and gravitational perturbations of black
   holes with any subextremal spin in modified gravity through METRICS: The
   scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity case
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
LA English
DT Article
ID GENERAL-RELATIVITY; TESTS; STABILITY; RECONSTRUCTION; CURVATURE;
   EQUATIONS; WAVES
AB The gravitational waves emitted in the ringdown phase of binary black hole coalescence are a unique probe of strong gravity. At late times in the ringdown, these waves can be described by quasinormal modes, whose frequencies encode the mass and spin of the remnant, as well as the theory of gravity in play. Understanding precisely how deviations from general relativity affect the quasinormal mode frequencies of ringing black holes, however, is extremely challenging, as it requires solving highly coupled and sometimes higher-order partial differential equations. We here extend a novel approach, metric perturbations with spectral methods (METRICS), to study the gravitational metric perturbations and the quasinormal mode frequencies of ringing black holes in modified gravity. We first derive the asymptotic behavior of gravitational perturbations at the event horizon and spatial infinity for rotating black holes beyond general relativity. We then extend the eigenvalue-perturbation theory approach of METRICS to allow us to compute the leading-order beyond general relativity corrections to the quasinormal-mode frequencies and metric perturbations. As an example, we apply METRICS to black holes with moderate spins in scalarGauss-Bonnet gravity. Without decoupling or simplifying the linearized field equations in this theory, we compute the leading-order corrections to the quasinormal frequencies of the axial and polar perturbations of the nlm 1/4 022, 021, and 033 modes of black holes with dimensionless spin a <= 0.85. The numerical accuracy of the METRICS frequencies is <= 10(-5) when a <= 0.6, 10(-4) when 0.6 < a <= 0.7, and 10(-2) when 0.7 < a <= 0.85 for all modes studied. We fit the frequencies with a polynomial in spin, whose coefficients (up to second order in spin) are consistent with those obtained in previous slow-rotating approximations. These results are the first accurate computations of the gravitational quasinormal-mode frequencies of rapidly rotating black holes (of a similar to 0.85) in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity.

AB Benthic delta O-18 stacks are the benchmarks by which paleoceanographic data are stratigraphically aligned and compared. However, a recent study found that between 1.8 and 1.9 million years ago (Ma) several Ceara Rise records differed substantially from the widely used LR04 global stack. Here, we use new Bayesian stacking software to construct regional stacks and demonstrate a geographical divergence in benthic delta O-18 features from 1.8 to 1.9 Ma. The pattern of isotopic stage features observed in the Ceara Rise is widespread throughout the Atlantic and differs notably from Pacific records. We propose that this regional difference in isotopic stages may be the result of relatively strong precession forcing and weaker obliquity forcing between 1.8 and 1.9 Ma. In accordance with the Antiphase Hypothesis, our results highlight a period of apparent sensitivity to regional precession forcing that is masked during most of the 41-Kyr world due to the amplitude modulation of obliquity forcing.

TI Tertiary Plasticity Drives the Efficiency of Enterocin 7B Interactions

AB The ability of antimicrobial peptides to efficiently kill their bacterial targets depends on the efficiency of their binding to the microbial membrane. In the case of enterocins, there is a three-part interaction: initial binding, unpacking of helices on the membrane surface, and permeation of the lipid bilayer. Helical unpacking is driven by disruption of the peptide hydrophobic core when in contact with membranes. Enterocin 7B is a leaderless enterocin antimicrobial peptide produced from Enterococcus faecalis that functions alone, or with its cognate partner enterocin 7A, to efficiently kill a wide variety of Gram-stain positive bacteria. To better characterize the role that tertiary structural plasticity plays in the ability of enterocin 7B to interact with the membranes, a series of arginine single-site mutants were constructed that destabilize the hydrophobic core to varying degrees. A series of experimental measures of structure, stability, and function, including CD spectra, far UV CD melting profiles, minimal inhibitory concentrations analysis, and release kinetics of calcein, show that decreased stabilization of the hydrophobic core is correlated with increased efficiency of a peptide to permeate membranes and in killing bacteria. Finally, using the computational technique of adaptive steered molecular dynamics, we found that the atomistic/energetic landscape of peptide mechanical unfolding leads to free energy differences between the wild type and its mutants, whose trends correlate well with our experiment.

AB Compressed edge DNN models usually experience decreasing model accuracy when performing inference due to data drift. To maintain the inference accuracy, retraining models with continuous learning is usually employed in the edge. However, online edge DNN inference with continuous learning faces new challenges. First, introducing retraining jobs leads to resource competition with the existing edge inference tasks, which will affect the inference latency. Second, retraining jobs and inference tasks exhibit significant differences in workload and latency requirements. These two jobs cannot adopt the same scheduling policy. To overcome the challenges, we propose an Online scheduling algorithm for INference with Continuous learning (OINC). OINC minimizes the weighted sum of the latency of inference tasks and the completion time of retraining jobs with limited edge resources, while ensuring the satisfaction of the inference task's service level objective (SLO) and meeting the deadlines of retraining jobs. OINC first reserves a portion of resources to complete all current inference tasks and allocates the remaining resources to retraining jobs. Subsequently, based on the reserved resource ratio, OINC invokes two sub-algorithms to select edges and allocate resources for each inference task and retraining job respectively. Compared with six state-of-the-art algorithms, OINC can reduce the weighted sum by up to 23.7%, and increase the success rate by up to 35.6%.

AB The widespread integration of deep neural networks in developing data-driven surrogate models for high-fidelity simulations of complex physical systems highlights the critical necessity for robust uncertainty quantification techniques and credibility assessment methodologies, ensuring the reliable deployment of surrogate models in consequential decision-making. This study presents the Occam Plausibility Algorithm for surrogate models (OPAL-surrogate), providing a systematic framework to uncover predictive neural network-based surrogate models within the large space of potential models, including various neural network classes and choices of architecture and hyperparameters. The framework is grounded in hierarchical Bayesian inferences and employs model validation tests to evaluate the credibility and prediction reliability of the surrogate models under uncertainty. Leveraging these principles, OPALsurrogate introduces a systematic and efficient strategy for balancing the trade-off between model complexity, accuracy, and prediction uncertainty. The effectiveness of OPAL-surrogate is demonstrated through two modeling problems, including the deformation of porous materials for building insulation and turbulent combustion flow for ablation of solid fuels within hybrid rocket motors.

AB Context. In recent years, the R-Process Alliance (RPA) has conducted a successful search for stars that are enhanced in elements produced by the rapid neutron-capture (r-)process. In particular, the RPA has uncovered a number of stars that are strongly enriched in light r-process elements, such as Sr, Y, and Zr. These so-called limited-r stars were investigated to explore the astrophysical production site(s) of these elements. Aims. We investigate the possible formation sites for light neutron-capture elements by deriving detailed abundances for neutron-capture elements from high-resolution spectra with a high signal-to-noise ratio of three limited-r stars. Methods. We conducted a kinematic analysis and a 1D local thermodynamic equilibrium spectroscopic abundance analysis of three stars. Furthermore, we calculated the lanthanide mass fraction (XLa) of our stars and of limited-r stars from the literature. Results. We found that the abundance pattern of neutron-capture elements of limited-r stars behaves differently depending on their [Ba/Eu] ratios, and we suggest that this should be taken into account in future investigations of their abundances. Furthermore, we found that the XLa of limited-r stars is lower than that of the kilonova AT2017gfo. The latter seems to be in the transition zone between limited-rXLa and that of r-I and r-II stars. Finally, we found that unlike r-I and r-II stars, the current sample of limited-r stars is largely born in the Galaxy and is not accreted.

ID QUANTIZATION
AB While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at learning complex latent-space representations, their over-parameterization can lead to overfitting and reduced performance, particularly with limited data. This, alongside their high computational and memory demands, limits the applicability of CNNs for edge deployment and applications where computational resources are constrained. Low-rank matrix approximation has emerged as a promising approach to reduce CNN parameters, but existing methods often require pre-determined ranks or involve complex post-training adjustments, leading to challenges in rank selection, performance loss, and limited practicality in resource-constrained environments. This underscores the need for an adaptive compression method that integrates into the training process, dynamically adjusting model complexity based on data and task requirements. To address this, we propose an efficient training method for CNN compression via dynamic parameter rank pruning. Our approach integrates efficient matrix factorization and novel regularization techniques, forming a robust framework for dynamic rank pruning and model compression. By using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to model low-rank convolutional filters and dense weight matrices, and training the SVD factors with back-propagation in an end-to-end manner, we achieve model compression. We evaluate our method on modern CNNs, including ResNet-18, ResNet-20, and ResNet-32, using datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet (2012). Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can reduce model parameters by up to 50% and improve classification accuracy by up to 2% over baseline models, making CNNs more feasible for practical applications.

AB PurposeCytoskeletal protein ensembles exhibit emergent mechanics where behavior in teams is not necessarily the sum of the components' single molecule properties. In addition, filaments may act as force sensors that distribute feedback and influence motor protein behavior. To understand the design principles of such emergent mechanics, we developed an approach utilizing QCM-D to measure how actomyosin bundles respond mechanically to environmental variables that alter constituent myosin II motor behavior.MethodsQCM-D is used for the first time to probe alterations in actin-myosin bundle viscoelasticity due to changes in skeletal myosin II concentration and motor nucleotide state. Actomyosin bundles were constructed on a gold QCM-D sensor using a microfluidic setup, and frequency and dissipation change measurements were recorded for each component addition to decipher which assay constituents lead to changes in bundle structural compliancy.ResultsLowering myosin concentration is detected as lower shifts in frequency and dissipation, while the relative changes in frequency and dissipation shifts for both the first and second actin additions are relatively similar. Strikingly, buffer washes with different nucleotides (ATP vs. ADP) yielded unique signatures in frequency and dissipation shifts. As myosin II's ADP-bound state tightly binds actin filaments, we observe an increase in frequency and decrease in dissipation change, indicating a decrease in viscoelasticity, likely due to myosin's increased affinity for actin, conversion from an active motor to a static crosslinker, and ability to recruit additional actin filaments from the surface, making an overall more rigid sensor coating. However, lowering the ADP concentration results in increased system compliancy, indicating that transient crosslinking and retaining a balance of motor activity perhaps results in a more cooperative and productive force generating system.ConclusionsQCM-D can detect changes in actomyosin viscoelasticity due to molecular-level alterations, such as motor concentration and nucleotide state. These results provide support for actin's role as a mechanical force-feedback sensor and demonstrate a new approach for deciphering the feedback mechanisms that drive emergent cytoskeletal ensemble crosstalk and intracellular mechanosensing. This approach can be adapted to investigate environmental influences on more complex cytoskeletal ensemble mechanics, including addition of other motors, crosslinkers, and filament types.

AB To mitigate Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks towards enterprise networks, we study the problem of scheduling DDoS traffic through on-premises scrubbing at the local edge and on-demand scrubbing in the remote clouds. We model this problem as a nonlinear mixed-integer program, which is characterized by the inputs of arbitrary dynamics and the trade-offs between staying at suboptimal scrubbing locations and using different best locations with switching overhead. We first design a prediction-oblivious online algorithm which consists of a carefully-designed fractional algorithm to pursue the long-term total cost minimization but avoid excessive switching overhead over time, and a randomized rounding algorithm to derive the flow-based, integral decisions. We next design a prediction-aware online algorithm which leverages the predicted inputs and can make even better scheduling decisions through invoking our prediction-oblivious online algorithm and improving its solutions via re-solving the original problem slice over each prediction window. We further extend our study to prioritize local scrubbing, and adapt our algorithms to this case correspondingly. Then, we rigorously prove the worst-case, constant competitive performance guarantees of our online algorithms. Finally, we conduct extensive evaluations and validate the superiority of our approach over multiple existing alternatives approaches.

AB Accurate prediction of protein stability changes due to mutations is instrumental for understanding mechanisms of disease and drug failure, as well as for engineering tailored protein-based materials. In recent years, computational tools using machine learning have been developed to predict stability changes and thereby supplement available experimental methods that may be time consuming and costly for bulk mutational analysis. Existing tools are limited, however, to predicting single point mutations and showing antisymmetric bias in direct/reverse mutations. Here, we develop structure and sequence-based models to predict protein stability changes via Gibbs free energy change upon single or multi-point mutations via two parallel augmented gated attention graph neural networks integrated with global attention blocks receiving subgraphs. These subgraphs are related to mutation sites and constructed through predicted protein contact maps to capture spatial structural information. We train our model on direct and reverse mutations obtained from the S5294 dataset and test on one independent test set and eight most commonly used test sets, including S350, P53, Ssym, S669, S1925, S250, and myoglobin. Our approach shows considerable improvement in estimating the impacts of stabilizing mutations, and consistently outperforms other methods by at least a 5.2% improvement in root mean square error. This approach can be employed for finding functionally important protein variants, helping to design new proteins with vast untapped potential for broad pharmaceutical applications.

AB During rotorcraft ship -deck landing operations, complex interactional aerodynamic phenomena occur between the rotor and ship airwakes which are not fully understood. To aid in ship-rotorcraft interactional investigations, efficient mid -fidelity ship airwake solutions are needed. Additionally, the effects of ship motion have not been explored much. In this study, the NATO Generic Destroyer, a shared, representative ship geometry created for collaborative studies, was investigated numerically using a GPU-accelerated Lattice -Boltzmann Method solver, and the ship airwake results compared with wind tunnel measurements using discrete velocity probes on the landing deck. The ship surface was modeled using a robust Grad immersed boundary approach, and ship motion was thereby included in the simulations. Ship airwake results showed good agreement with the experiment and excellent computational performance. Simulations took under four hours to run on a single GPU node. This is several orders of magnitude improvement over traditional Delayed Detached -Eddy Simulations typically used to solve this problem, which may take days or weeks on CPU -based HPC clusters.

AB We propose an equity-aware GRAph-fusion differentiable Pooling neural network to accurately predict the spatio-temporal urban mobility (e.g., station-level bike usage in terms of departures and arrivals) with Equity (GRAPE). GRAPE consists of two independent hierarchical graph neural networks for two mobility systems-one as a target graph (i.e., a bike sharing system) and the other as an auxiliary graph (e.g., a taxi system). We have designed a convolutional fusion mechanism to jointly fuse the target and auxiliary graph embeddings and extract the shared spatial and temporal mobility patterns within the embeddings to enhance prediction accuracy. To further improve the equity of bike sharing systems for diverse communities, we focus on the bike resource allocation and model prediction performance, and propose to regularize the predicted bike resource as well as the accuracy across advantaged and disadvantaged communities, and thus mitigate the potential unfairness in the predicted bike sharing usage. Our evaluation of over 23 million bike rides and 100 million taxi trips in New York City and Chicago has demonstrated GRAPE to outperform all of the baseline approaches in terms of prediction accuracy (by 15.80% for NYC and 50.55% for Chicago on average) and social equity awareness (by 32.44% and 24.43% in terms of resource fairness for NYC and Chicago, and 13.36% and 16.52% in terms of performance fairness).

AB Student experiences learning chemistry have been well studied in chemistry courses but less so in biology courses. Chemistry concepts are foundational to introductory biology courses, and student experiences learning chemistry concepts may impact their overall course experiences and subsequent student outcomes. In this study, we asked undergraduate students enrolled in introductory biology courses at a public R1 institution an open-response question asking how their experiences learning chemistry topics affected their identities as biologists. We used thematic analysis to identify common ideas in their responses. We found that while almost half of student respondents cited learning chemistry as having positive impacts on their experiences learning biology, students who struggled with chemistry topics were significantly more likely to have negative experiences learning biology. We also found significant relationships between prior chemistry preparation, student background, and the likelihood of students struggling with chemistry and negative experiences learning biology. These findings emphasize the impact of learning specific content on student psychosocial metrics and suggest areas for biology educators to focus on to support learning and alleviate student stress in introductory biology.

AB Shape morphing of stimuli-responsive composite hydrogels has received considerable attention in different research fields. Although various multilayer structures with dissimilar materials are studied to achieve shape morphing, combining swellable hydrogel layers with non-swellable layers results in issues with interface adhesion and structural integrity. In this study, single-hydrogel-based bilayer actuators comprising poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) matrices and graphene oxide (GO)-PNIPAM hinges are presented. Upon temperature rising, the PNIPAM hydrogel acts as the passive layer due to the formation of dense microstructures near the surface (i.e., the skin layer effect), whereas the GO-PNIPAM hydrogel functions as the active layer, maintaining porous due to structural modification by the presence of GO. Under light exposure, the GO-PNIPAM hinges experience selective heating due to the photothermal effect of GO. Consequently, the resulting bilayer structures exhibit programmable dual-responsive 3D shape morphing. Additionally, the folding kinetics of these actuators can be adjusted based on the applied stimulus (temperature changes or light), as they are driven by different mechanisms, the skin layer, or photothermal effects, respectively. Furthermore, the hinge-based bilayer structures demonstrate walking and steering locomotion by light exposure. This approach can lead to advances in soft robotics, biomimetic systems, and autonomous soft actuators in hydrogel-based systems.

AB Nonreciprocal thermal emission is a cutting-edge technology that enables fundamental control over thermal radiation and has exciting applications in thermal energy harvesting. However, thus far one of the foremost challenges is making nonreciprocal emission operate over a broad wavelength range and for multiple angles. In this work, we solve this outstanding problem by proposing three different types of structures that always utilize only one Weyl semimetal (WSM) thin film combined with one or two additional dielectric or metallic layers and terminated by a metallic substrate. First, a tradeoff relationship between the magnitude and bandwidth of the thermal nonreciprocity contrast is established based on the thickness of the WSM film. Then, the bandwidth broadening effect is demonstrated via the insertion of a dielectric spacer layer that can also be fine-tuned by varying its thickness. Finally, further control on the resulting strong nonreciprocal thermal radiation is demonstrated by the addition of a thin metallic layer in the proposed few layer designs. The presented composite structures work for a broad frequency range and for multiple emission angles, resulting in highly advantageous properties for various nonreciprocal thermal radiation applications. Moreover, the proposed designs do not require any patterning and can be experimentally realized by simple deposition fabrication methods. They are expected to aid in the creation of broadband nonreciprocal thermal emitters that can find applications in new energy harvesting devices. & COPY; 2023

AB Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are among the most promising candidates for advanced energy storage technology; however, their commercial viability is bottlenecked by the sluggish redox kinetics of sulfur and the notorious polysulfide shuttle effect. Here we apply a single amino acid, L-leucine (Leu), as a liquid electrolyte additive to curtail these critical issues and enhance the performance of the battery. With an ultralow dosage of 0.1 wt%, the additive greatly increases wettability of the electrolyte on the separator and facilitates Li+ ion transport. Leu also exhibits a catalytic effect on the conversion of soluble Li2Sx to solid Li2S, effectively combating the shuttle effect. Consequently, Li-S cells with the Leu additive display improved rate performance and higher discharge capacities during cycling. This study showcases the novel and facile application of an abundant amino acid, opening avenues for further investigation into bio-derived electrolyte additives for Li-S batteries.

AB The design and implementation of boundary conditions for the robust generation and simulation of periodic finite-amplitude internal waves is examined in a quasi two-layer continuous stratification using a spectral-element-method-based incompressible flow solver. The commonly used Eulerian approach develops spurious, and potentially catastrophic small-scale numerical features near the wave-generating boundary in a non-linear stratification when the parameter A/(delta c) is sufficiently larger than unity; A and delta are measures of the maximum wave-induced vertical velocity and pycnocline thickness, respectively, and c is the linear wave propagation speed. To this end, an Euler-Lagrange approach is developed and implemented to generate robust high-amplitude periodic deep-water internal waves. Central to this approach is to take into account the wave-induced (isopycnal) displacement of the pycnocline in both the vertical and (effectively) upstream directions. With amplitudes not restricted by the limits of linear theory, the Euler-Lagrange-generated waves maintain their structural integrity as they propagate away from the source. The advantages of the high-accuracy numerical method, whose minimal numerical dissipation cannot damp the above near-source spurious numerical features of the purely Eulerian case, can still be preserved and leveraged further along the wave propagation path through the robust reproduction of the non-linear adjustments of the waveform. The near- and far-source robustness of the optimized Euler-Lagrange approach is demonstrated for finite-amplitude waves in a sharp quasi two-layer continuous stratification representative of seasonally stratified lakes. The findings of this study provide an enabling framework for two-dimensional simulations of internal swash zones driven by well-developed non-linear internal waves and, ultimately, the accompanying turbulence-resolving three-dimensional simulations.

AB Multimodal fusion networks play a pivotal role in leveraging diverse sources of information for enhanced machine learning applications in aerial imagery. However, current approaches often suffer from a bias towards certain modalities, diminishing the potential benefits of multimodal data. This paper addresses this issue by proposing a novel modality utilization-based training method for multimodal fusion networks. The method aims to guide the network's utilization on its input modalities, ensuring a balanced integration of complementary information streams, effectively mitigating the overutilization of dominant modalities. The method is validated on multimodal aerial imagery classification and image segmentation tasks, effectively maintaining modality utilization within +/- 10% of the user-defined target utilization and demonstrating the versatility and efficacy of the proposed method across various applications. Furthermore, the study explores the robustness of the fusion networks against noise in input modalities, a crucial aspect in real-world scenarios. The method showcases better noise robustness by maintaining performance amidst environmental changes affecting different aerial imagery sensing modalities. The network trained with 75.0% EO utilization achieves significantly better accuracy (81.4%) in noisy conditions (noise variance = 0.12) compared to traditional training methods with 99.59% EO utilization (73.7%). Additionally, it maintains an average accuracy of 85.0% across different noise levels, outperforming the traditional method's average accuracy of 81.9%. Overall, the proposed approach presents a significant step towards harnessing the full potential of multimodal data fusion in diverse machine learning applications such as robotics, healthcare, satellite imagery, and defense applications.

AB Insoluble electrically n-doped fullerene-containing films have been obtained by thermal annealing of a fullerene compound and a 1,3-dimethyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[d]imidazole n-dopant moiety, both of which are functionalized with a 7-butoxybenzocyclobutene group. The covalent tethering and electrical doping reactions are studied by mass spectrometry as well as electron paramagnetic resonance. Optical absorption spectra on BBCB-N-DMBI-H-doped BBCBP indicate films heated at 150 degrees C for 10 min are unaffected by immersion for 10 min in ortho-dichlorobenzene. Although films containing a 10 mol % loading of the dopant showed electrical conductivity values of 1.1 x 10(-5) +/- 3.4 x 10(-7) S cm(-1) prior to heating, the thermal insolubilization process led to values around two orders-of-magnitude lower. However, the thermal insolubilization also leads to immobilization of the dopant molecule and the corresponding cation, reducing their ability to diffuse into an adjacent layer of a stronger electron acceptor.

AB The intricate sulfur redox chemistry involves multiple electron transfers and complicated phase changes. Catalysts have been previously explored to overcome the kinetic barrier in lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs). This work contributes to closing the knowledge gap and examines electrocatalysis for enhancing LSB kinetics. With a strong chemical affinity for polysulfides, the electrocatalyst enables efficient adsorption and accelerated electron transfer reactions. Resulting cells with catalyzed cathodes exhibit improved rate capability and excellent stability over 500 cycles with 91.9% capacity retention at C/3. In addition, cells were shown to perform at high rates up to 2C and at high sulfur loadings up to 6 mg cm-2. Various electrochemical, spectroscopic, and microscopic analyses provide insights into the mechanism for retaining high activity, coulombic efficiency, and capacity. This work delves into crucial processes identifying pivotal reaction steps during the cycling process at commercially relevant areal capacities and rates.

ID HIGH-LATITUDE THERMOSPHERE; MORPHOLOGY; DYNAMICS; CELLS; FIELD; MODEL
AB We present results from a study of the time lags between changes in the energy flow into the polar regions and the response of the thermosphere to the heating. Measurements of the neutral density from the Challenging Mini-satellite Payload (CHAMP) and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) missions are used, along with calculations of the total Poynting flux entering the poles. During two major geomagnetic storms in 2003, these data show increased densities are first seen on the dayside edge of the auroral ovals after a surge in the energy input. At lower latitudes, the densities reach their peak values on the dayside earlier than on the night side. A puzzling response seen in the CHAMP measurements during the November 2003 storm was that the density at a fixed location near the "Harang discontinuity" remained at unusually low levels during three sequential orbit passes, while elsewhere the density increased. The entire database of measurements from the CHAMP and GRACE missions were used to derive maps of the density time lags across the globe. The maps show a large gradient between short and long time delays between 60 degrees and 30 degrees geographic latitude. They confirm the findings from the two storm periods, that near the equator, the density on the dayside responds earlier than on the nightside. The time lags are longest near 18-20 hr local time. The time lag maps could be applied to improve the accuracy of empirical thermosphere models, and developers of numerical models may find these results useful for comparisons with their calculations.
   The interaction of the solar wind with the Earth's magnetosphere causes varying levels of heating in the ionosphere. This heating is produced by auroral currents at high latitudes, which in tur n causes the density of the upper atmosphere to change. A topic of importance is to determine how rapidly the density can increase at different locations around the globe following a surge in the heating, which can be calculated from measurements of the solar wind velocity and embedded magnetic fields. This study used measurements of the atmospheric density on two satellite missions known as Challenging Mini-satellite Payload and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment. The results show that the density increases first near the poles, and much longer at lower latitudes, as expected. The time lags between changes in the energy input and the density response have been determined for the first time on a global scale. Maps of the time lags are derived. Near the equator the lags are shorter near local noon, and longer before local midnight. The time lag maps can used to improve empirical and numerical models of the thermosphere. More accurate models are needed for more precise predictions of the drag that satellites will encounter, and the subsequent changes in their orbits.

AB Worker specialization extends the behavioral and ecological repertoire of ant colonies. Specialization may relate to colony defense, brood care, foraging, and, in some taxa, storage. Replete workers swell the crop and gaster to store liquid food, which can be accessed by other colony members through trophallaxis. This storage ability, known as repletism, has independently evolved across several ant lineages, but the temporal history of this trait has not yet been investigated. Here, we describe the first fossil replete in the extinct species Leptomyrmex neotropicus BARONI URBANI, 1980 preserved in Miocene-age Dominican amber. Together with new evidence of repletism in L. neotropicus' extant sister species, Leptomyrmex relictus BOUDINOT & al., 2016, we reconstruct the pattern of acquisition and descent in this storage-linked trait. Our ancestral-state reconstruction suggests that Leptomyrmex acquired replete workers in the Eocene and may therefore represent the earliest instance of so- called "honeypot" ants among all known ants, both living and extinct.

AB In this work we explore multiple search strategies for Higgsinos and mixed Higgsino-wino states in the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) and project the results onto the (mu, M2) plane. Assuming associated production of Higgsino-like pairs with a W/Z boson, we develop a search in a channel characterized by a hadronically tagged vector boson accompanied by missing energy. We use as our template an ATLAS search for dark matter produced in association with a hadronically decaying vector boson, but upgrade the search by implementing a joint -likelihood analysis, binning the missing transverse energy distribution, which greatly improves the search sensitivity. For Higgsino-like states (more than 96% admixture) we find sensitivity to masses up to 550 GeV. For well -mixed Higgsino-wino states (70-30% Higgsino) we still find sensitivities above 300 GeV. Using this newly proposed search, we draw a phenomenological map of the wino-Higgsino parameter space, recasting several complementary searches for disappearing tracks, soft leptons, trileptons, and hadronic diboson events in order to predict LHC coverage of the (mu, M2) mass plane at integrated luminosities of up to 3 ab-1. Altogether, the full run of the HL-LHC can exclude much of the "natural" (mu, M2 < 500 GeV) wino-Higgsino parameter space.

AB Marine pollution is becoming ubiquitous in the environment. Observations of pollution on beaches, in the coastal ocean, and in organisms in the Antarctic are becoming distressingly common. Increasing human activity, growing tourism, and an expanding krill fishing industry along the West Antarctic Peninsula all represent potential sources of plastic pollution and other debris (collectively referred to as debris) to the region. However, the sources of these pollutants from point (pollutants released from discrete sources) versus non-point (pollutants from a large area rather than a specific source) sources are poorly understood. We used buoyant simulated particles released in a high-resolution physical ocean model to quantify pollutant loads throughout the region. We considered non-point sources of debris from the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, Bellingshausen Sea, Weddell Sea, and point source pollution from human activities including tourism, research, and fishing. We also determined possible origins for observed debris based on data from the Southern Ocean Observing System and Palmer Long-Term Ecological Research program. Our results indicate that point source pollution released in the coastal Antarctic is more likely to serve as a source for observed debris than non-point sources, and that the dominant source of pollution is region-specific. Penguin colonies in the South Shetland and Elephant Islands had the greatest debris load from point sources whereas loads from non-point sources were greatest around the southernmost colonies. Penguin colonies at Cornwallis Island and Fort Point were exposed to the highest theoretical debris loads. While these results do not include physical processes such as windage and Stokes Drift that are known to impact debris distributions and transport in the coastal ocean, these results provide critical insights to building an effective stratified sampling and monitoring effort to better understand debris distributions, concentrations, and origins throughout the West Antarctic Peninsula.

AB It has been experimentally and theoretically analyzed that noise-induced excitability in quantum well and quantum dot semiconductor laser systems usually produces sharp spike patterns of non-uniform amplitude. In this paper, we experimentally record that a quantum cascade oscillator injected externally with a monochromatic laser beam exhibits a series of highly uniform spike trains, which occur in the proximity of the saddle-node bifurcation. Theoretical analysis based on a properly designed single-mode rate equation model endowed with quantum noise reveals that this high uniformity has its primary origin in the ultrashort carrier lifetime of the quantum cascade laser gain medium that is typically close to 1 ps.

AB T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing protein-3 (TIM3) is an important receptor protein that modulates the immune system. The binding of TIM3 with Galectin 9 (GAL9) triggers immune system suppression, but the TIM3-GAL9 binding can be inhibited by binding of the peptide P26 to TIM3. A fast and accurate prediction of the P26-TIM3 binding site is crucial and a prerequisite for the investigation of P26-TIM3 interactions and TIM3-GAL9 binding pathways. Here, we present a machine learning approach, which considers protein conformational changes, to quickly identify the ligand-binding site on TIM3. Our results show that the P26 binding site is located near the C?-D loop of TIM3. Further simulations show that the binding pose is stabilized by a variety of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. Binding of P26 can alter the conformations of nearby glycan side chains on TIM3, providing possible mechanisms of how P26 inhibits TIM3-GAL9 binding pathways. The insights from this work will facilitate the identification of other peptides or antibodies that may also inhibit the TIM3-GAL9 pathways and eventually lead to improved attempts in the modulation of the TIM3-GAL9 immunosuppression pathways. The strategies and machine learning method can be generalized to study ligand-receptor binding when the conformational changes during the binding are important.

AB The recent outbreaks of harmful algal blooms in the western Lake Erie Basin (WLEB) have drawn tremendous attention to bloom prediction for better control and management. Many weekly to annual bloom prediction models have been reported, but they only employ small datasets, have limited types of input features, build linear regression or probabilistic models, or require complex process-based computations. To address these limitations, we conducted a comprehensive literature review, complied a large dataset containing chlorophyll-a index (from 2002 to 2019) as the output and a novel combination of riverine (the Maumee & Detroit Rivers) and meteorological (WLEB) features as the input, and built machine learning-based classification and regression models for 10-d scale bloom predictions. By analyzing the feature importance, we identified 8 most important features for the HAB control, including nitrogen loads, time, water levels, soluble reactive phosphorus load, and solar irradiance. Here, both long- and short-term nitrogen loads were for the first time considered in HAB models for Lake Erie. Based on these features, the 2-, 3-, and 4-level random forest classification models achieved an accuracy of 89.6%, 77.0%, and 66.7%, respectively, and the regression model achieved an R2 value of 0.69. In addition, longshort term memory (LSTM) was implemented to predict temporal trends of four short-term features (N, solar irradiance, and two water levels) and achieved the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.12-0.97. Feeding the LSTM model predictions for these features into the 2-level classification model reached an accuracy of 86.0% for predicting the HABs in 2017-2018, suggesting that we can provide short-term HAB forecasts even when the feature values are not available.

AB Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) are emerging players in regulation of gene expression and cell signaling and their dysregulation has been implicated in a multitude of human diseases. Recent studies from our laboratory revealed that lncRNAs play critical roles in cytokine regulation, inflammation, and metabolism. We demonstrated that lncRNA HOTAIR, which is a well-known regulator of gene silencing, plays critical roles in modulation of cytokines and proinflammatory genes, and glucose metabolism in macrophages during inflammation. In addition, we recently discovered a series of novel lncRNAs that are closely associated with inflammation and macrophage activation. We termed these as long-noncoding inflammation associated RNAs (LinfRNAs). We are currently engaged in the functional characterization of these hLinfRNAs (human LinfRNAs) with a focus on their roles in inflammation, and we are investigating their potential implications in chronic inflammatory human diseases. Here, we have summarized experimental methods that have been utilized for the discovery and functional characterization of lncRNAs in inflammation and macrophage activation.

AB Heterogeneous photocatalysts (PCs) have garnered attention for their sustainability and cost-effectiveness. Despite the existence of various types of these PCs, their synthesis often involves complex, multi-step procedures and laborious purification. Herein, we propose a simple method for attaching small-molecule photocatalytic species onto crosslinked 3-D polymer networks as insoluble scaffolds to create robust heterogeneous PCs. The highly swellable poly(ethylene glycol)-based ChemMatrix (CM) resin, known for its amphiphilic properties and high functional group loading, facilitated the covalent immobilization of the photoredox dye Eosin Y (EY), but also streamlined functionalization with Ir(iii) complexes. The resulting heterogeneous CM-EY demonstrated efficient photocatalytic performance in open-to-air dual photoredox catalysis of atom transfer radical polymerization (photo-ATRP) under green light. This was confirmed by the well-controlled synthesis of polymers with molecular masses ranging from 20 kDa to 300 kDa and low dispersities. Furthermore, CM-EY exhibited excellent photostability and recyclability over multiple cycles of ATRP. The heterogeneous catalysis of photo-ATRP provided high temporal control and enabled benign conditions for synthesizing protein-polymer hybrids (PPH). When combined with the initiator-modified CM (CM-BIB), CM-EY facilitated the solid-phase synthesis of homopolymers and block copolymers with recyclable performance. However, the coordinatively bound Ir@CM showed decreased catalytic activity and efficiency toward photoredox dehalogenation due to the leaching of active species during recycling. This study highlights the advantages of the covalent linking of catalysts to solid supports over non-covalent interactions, underscoring the potential of functionalized polymer resin as a promising scaffold. Such an approach offers customization and tunability, presenting opportunities for innovation in green chemistry.

AB Highly sensitive stimuli-responsive luminescent materials are crucial for applications in optical sensing, security, and anticounterfeiting. Here, we report two zero-dimensional (0D) copper(I) halides, (TEP)2Cu2Br4, (TEP)2Cu4Br6, and 1D (TEP)3Ag6Br9, which are comprised of isolated [Cu2Br4]2-, [Cu4Br6]2-, and [Ag6Br9]3- polyanions, respectively, separated by TEP+ (tetraethylphosphonium [TEP]) cations. (TEP)2Cu2Br4 and (TEP)2Cu4Br6 demonstrate greenish-white and orange-red emissions, respectively, with near unity photoluminescence quantum yields, while (TEP)3Ag6Br9 is a poor light emitter. Optical spectroscopy measurements and density-functional theory calculations reveal that photoemissions of these compounds originate from self-trapped excitons due to the excited-state distortions in the copper(I) halide units. Crystals of Cu(I) halides are radioluminescence active at room temperature under both X- and gamma-rays exposure. The light yields up to 15,800 ph/MeV under 662 keV gamma-rays of 137Cs suggesting their potential for scintillation applications. Remarkably, (TEP)2Cu2Br4 and (TEP)2Cu4Br6 are interconvertible through chemical stimuli or reverse crystallization. In addition, both compounds demonstrate luminescence on-off switching upon thermal stimuli. The sensitivity of (TEP)2Cu2Br4 and (TEP)2Cu4Br6 to the chemical and thermal stimuli coupled with their ultrabright emission allows their consideration for applications such as solid-state lighting, sensing, information storage, and anticounterfeiting.
   Green emitting (TEP)2Cu2Br4 and orange emitting (TEP)2Cu4Br6 are reported. Due to their photoluminescence efficiencies approaching 100%, these materials are promising for solid-state lighting, and X- and gamma-rays scintillation applications. Furthermore, (TEP)2Cu2Br4 and (TEP)2Cu4Br6 are sensitive to external stimuli, which enables their use in high-level anti-counterfeiting and information storage applications. image

AB Polydimethylsiloxane is an important polymeric material with a wide range of applications. However, environmental effects like low temperature can induce crystallization in this material with resulting changes in its structural and dynamic properties. The incorporation of phenyl-siloxane components, e.g., as in a poly(dimethyl-co-diphenyl)siloxane random copolymer, is known to suppress such crystallization. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can be a powerful tool to understand such effects in atomistic detail. Unfortunately, all-atomistic molecular dynamics (AAMD) is limited in both spatial dimensions and simulation times it can probe. To overcome such constraints and to extend to more useful length- and time-scales, we systematically develop a coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) model for the poly(dimethyl-co-diphenyl)siloxane system with bonded and non-bonded interactions determined from all-atomistic simulations by the iterative Boltzmann inversion (IBI) method. Additionally, we propose a lever rule that can be useful to generate non-bonded potentials for such systems without reference to the all-atomistic ground truth. Our model captures the structural and dynamic properties of the copolymer material with quantitative accuracy and is useful to study long-time dynamics of highly-entangled systems, sequence-dependent properties, phase behaviour, etc.

AB The recent advent of quantum algorithms for noisy quantum devices offers a new route toward simulating strong light-matter interactions of molecules in optical cavities for polaritonic chemistry. In this work, we introduce a general framework for simulating electron-photon-coupled systems on small, noisy quantum devices. This method is based on the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) with the polaritonic unitary coupled cluster (PUCC) ansatz. To achieve chemical accuracy, we exploit various symmetries in qubit reduction methods, such as electron-photon parity, and use recently developed error mitigation schemes, such as the reference zero-noise extrapolation method. We explore the robustness of the VQE-PUCC approach across a diverse set of regimes for the bond length, cavity frequency, and coupling strength of the H2 molecule in an optical cavity. To quantify the performance, we measure two properties: ground-state energy, fundamentally relevant to chemical reactivity, and photon number, an experimentally accessible general indicator of electron-photon correlation.

AB Electronic communication in natural systems makes use, inter alia, of molecular transmission, where electron transfer occurs within networks of redox reactions, which play a vital role in many physiological systems. In view of the limited understanding of redox signaling, we developed an approach and an electrochemical-optical labon-a-chip to observe cellular responses in localized redox environments. The developed fluidic micro-system uses electrogenetic bacteria in which a cellular response is activated to electrically and chemically induced stimulations. Specifically, controlled environments for the cells are created by using microelectrodes to generate spatiotemporal redox gradients. The in-situ cellular responses at both single-cell and population levels are monitored by optical microscopy. The elicited electrogenetic fluorescence intensities after 210 min in response to electrochemical and chemical activation were 1.3 x 108 +/- 0.30 x 108 arbitrary units (A.U.) and 1.2 x 108 +/- 0.30 x 108 A.U. per cell population, respectively, and 1.05 +/- 0.01 A.U. and 1.05 +/- 0.01 A.U. per-cell, respectively. We demonstrated that redox molecules' mass transfer between the electrode and cells - and not the applied electrical field - activated the electrogenetic cells. Specifically, we found an oriented amplified electrogenetic response on the charged electrodes' downstream side, which was determined by the location of the stimulating electrodes and the flow profile. We then focused on the cellular responses and observed distinct subpopulations that were attributed to electrochemical rather than chemical stimulation, with the distance between the cells and the stimulating electrode being the main determinant. These observations provide a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms by which diffusible redox mediators serve as electron shuttles, imposing context and activating electrogenetic responses.

AB CO2 capture and transformation into chemical fuels presents a useful carbon-neutral energy source to curb the effects of global warming if the electrocatalyst used is highly active, exhibits sufficient product selectivity, and is energetically efficient. Metal nanoparticles (NPs) have emerged as a promising class of catalysts for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) and their product selectivity are expected to be further improved through surface modification with different ligands. The primary objective of this work is to compare the use of Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy (SECM) and Rotating Ring Disk Electrode (RRDE) to study CO2 reduction at silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) modified with amino acids (cysteine and tryptophan) and Ag NPs synthesized by a citrate reduction method. RRDE studies showed the onset potential for CO2RR was earlier for both the Ag NPs with cysteine and Ag NPs with tryptophan than those with citrate. SECM showed earlier onset potentials for CO2RR than the RRDE experiment for every type of Ag NP as well as higher sensitivity in detecting the major CO2RR products such as formate and CO. SECM also showed less hydrogen formation for the Ag NPs with cysteine and Ag NPs with tryptophan.

   PERFORMANCE; EFFICIENCY
AB AMX Zintl compounds, crystallizing in several closely related layered structures, have recently garnered attention due to their exciting thermoelectric properties. In this study, we show that orthorhombic CaAgSb can be alloyed with hexagonal CaAgBi to achieve a solid solution with a structural transformation at x similar to 0.8. This transition can be seen as a switch from three-dimensional (3D) to two-dimensional (2D) covalent bonding in which the interlayer M-X bond distances expand while the in-plane M-X distances contract. Measurements of the elastic moduli reveal that CaAgSb1-xBix becomes softer with increasing Bi content, with the exception of a steplike 10% stiffening observed at the 3D-to-2D phase transition. Thermoelectric transport measurements reveal promising Hall mobility and a peak zT of 0.47 at 620 K for intrinsic CaAgSb, which is higher than those in previous reports for unmodified CaAgSb. However, alloying with Bi was found to increase the hole concentration beyond the optimal value, effectively lowering the zT. Interestingly, analysis of the thermal conductivity and electrical conductivity suggests that the Bi-rich alloys are low Lorenz-number (L) materials, with estimated values of L well below the nondegenerate limit of L = 1.5 x 10(-8) W Omega K-2, in spite of the metallic-like transport properties. A low Lorenz number decouples lattice and electronic thermal conductivities, providing greater flexibility for enhancing thermoelectric properties.

AB As electric vehicles (EVs) become increasingly common in transportation infrastructures, the need to strengthen and diversify the EV charging systems becomes more necessary. Dynamic Wireless Power Transfer (DWPT) roadways allow EVs to be recharged while in-motion, thus allowing to improve the driving ranges and facilitating the widespread adoption of EVs. One major challenge to adopt large-scale DWPT networks is to efficiently and accurately develop load demand models to comprehend the complex behavior on power distribution grid due to difficulty in developing power electronic simulations for charging systems consisting of either numerous transmitter pads or high traffic volumes. This paper proposes a novel modified Toeplitz convolution method for efficient large-scale DWPT load demand modeling. The proposed method achieves more accurate modeling of DWPT systems from a few transmitter pads to tens of miles in real-world traffic scenarios with light computational load. Test results for a small-scale DWPT system are first generated to validate the accuracy of the proposed method before scaling to large-scale load demand modeling where real-world traffic flow data is utilized in DWPT networks ranging from 2-10 miles. A comparative analysis is further performed for the scenarios under consideration to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method.

AB There is a growing need for models that are interpretable and have reduced energy/computational cost (e.g., in health care analytics and federated learning). Examples of algorithms to train such models include logistic regression and boosting. However, one challenge facing these algorithms is that they provably suffer from label noise; this has been attributed to the joint interaction between oft-used convex loss functions and simpler hypothesis classes, resulting in too much emphasis being placed on outliers. In this work, we use the margin-based a-loss, which continuously tunes between canonical convex and quasiconvex losses, to robustly train simple models. We show that the a hyperparameter smoothly introduces non-convexity and offers the benefit of "giving up" on noisy training examples. We also provide results on the Long-Servedio dataset for boosting and a COVID-19 survey dataset for logistic regression, highlighting the efficacy of our approach across multiple relevant domains.

AB A local-sensitivity-analysis technique is employed to generate new skeletal reaction models for methane combustion from the foundational fuel chemistry model (FFCM-1). The sensitivities of the thermo-chemical variables with respect to the reaction rates are computed via the forced-optimally time dependent (f-OTD) methodology. In this methodology, the large sensitivity matrix containing all local sensitivities is modeled as a product of two low-rank time-dependent matrices. The evolution equations of these matrices are derived from the governing equations of the system. The modeled sensitivities are computed for the auto-ignition of methane at atmospheric and high pressures with different sets of initial temperatures, and equivalence ratios. These sensitivities are then analyzed to rank the most important (sensitive) species. A series of skeletal models with different number of species and levels of accuracy in reproducing the FFCM-1 results are suggested. The performances of the generated models are compared against FFCM-1 in predicting the ignition delay, the laminar flame speed, and the flame extinction. The results of this comparative assessment suggest the skeletal models with 24 and more species generate the FFCM-1 results with an excellent accuracy.

AB Improving the charge storage capacity and lifetime and charging/discharging efficiency of battery systems is essential for large-scale applications such as long-term grid storage and long-range automobiles. While there have been substantial improvements over the past decades, further fundamental research would help provide insights into improving the cost effectiveness of such systems. For example, it is critical to understand the redox activities of cathode and anode electrode materials and stability and the formation mechanism and roles of the solid-electrolyte interface (SEI) that forms at the electrode surface upon an external potential bias. The SEI plays a critical role in preventing electrolyte decay while still allowing charges to flow through the system while serving as a charge transfer barrier. While surface analytical techniques such as X-ray photoelectron (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) provide invaluable information on anode chemical composition, crystalline structure, and morphology, they are often performed ex situ, which can induce changes to the SEI layer after it is removed from the electrolyte. While there have been efforts to combine these techniques using pseudo-in situ approaches via vacuum-compatible devices and inert atmosphere chambers connected to glove boxes, there is still a need for true in situ techniques to obtain results with improved accuracy and precision. Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) is an in situ scanning probe technique that can be combined with optical spectroscopy techniques such as Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopy methods to gain insights into the electronic changes of a material as a function of applied bias. This Review will highlight the potential of SECM and recent reports on combining spectroscopic measurements with SECM to gain insights into the SEI layer formation and redox activities of other battery electrode materials. These insights provide invaluable information for improving the performance of charge storage devices.

ID REGRET
AB The fairness-aware online learning framework has emerged as a potent tool within the context of continuous lifelong learning. In this scenario, the learner's objective is to progressively acquire new tasks as they arrive over time, while also guaranteeing statistical parity among various protected sub-populations, such as race and gender when it comes to the newly introduced tasks. A significant limitation of current approaches lies in their heavy reliance on the i.i.d (independent and identically distributed) assumption concerning data, leading to a static regret analysis of the framework. Nevertheless, it's crucial to note that achieving low static regret does not necessarily translate to strong performance in dynamic environments characterized by tasks sampled from diverse distributions. In this article, to tackle the fairness-aware online learning challenge in evolving settings, we introduce a unique regret measure, FairSAR, by incorporating long-term fairness constraints into a strongly adapted loss regret framework. Moreover, to determine an optimal model parameter at each time step, we introduce an innovative adaptive fairness-aware online meta-learning algorithm, referred to as FairSAOML. This algorithm possesses the ability to adjust to dynamic environments by effectively managing bias control and model accuracy. The problem is framed as a bi-level convex-concave optimization, considering both the model's primal and dual parameters, which pertain to its accuracy and fairness attributes, respectively. Theoretical analysis yields sub-linear upper bounds for both loss regret and the cumulative violation of fairness constraints. Our experimental evaluation of various real-world datasets in dynamic environments demonstrates that our proposed FairSAOML algorithm consistently outperforms alternative approaches rooted in the most advanced prior online learning methods.

DT Article
ID TRANSITION-METAL DICHALCOGENIDES; ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE; LAYER;
   ELECTROCHEMISTRY
AB A fundamental challenge in pursuing topological states in twisted homobilayer transition metal dichalcogenides is the relative energies between the valence band extrema at the topologically trivial P and nontrivial K/K' valleys. We employ many-body perturbation theory within the GW approximation to investigate the energy difference of the valence band extrema in homobilayer WSe2 and MoTe2, the two most promising candidate platforms hosting various quantum phases. In contrast to the results obtained from density functional theory, the GW calculation predicts quasiparticle energies of the K/K' valley above those of the P valley for all high-symmetry stackings. We further develop a "fractional folding" technique, allowing for the inclusion of substrate and encapsulating dielectric screening effects in GW simulations. We find that while environmental dielectric screening from hexagonal boron nitride reduces the energy difference between the K/K' and P valley extrema, the valence band maximum remains situated at the topologically nontrivial K/K' valley. Finally, many-body effects enhance the depth of the moir & eacute; potential, leading to a shift of the "magic angle," compared to the result from density functional theory. Our study offers quasiparticle energy landscapes to guide the search for twisted homobilayers of topological interest.

DE Model editing; knowledge update; fine-tuning; large language models
AB Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently transformed both the academic and industrial landscapes due to their remarkable capacity to understand, analyze, and generate texts based on their vast knowledge and reasoning ability. Nevertheless, one major drawback of LLMs is their substantial computational cost for pre-training due to their unprecedented amounts of parameters. The disadvantage is exacerbated when new knowledge frequently needs to be introduced into the pre-trained model. Therefore, it is imperative to develop effective and efficient techniques to update pre-trained LLMs. Traditional methods encode new knowledge in pre-trained LLMs through direct fine-tuning. However, naively re-training LLMs can be computationally intensive and risks degenerating valuable pre-trained knowledge irrelevant to the update in the model. Recently, Knowledge-based Model Editing (KME), also known as Knowledge Editing or Model Editing, has attracted increasing attention, which aims at precisely modifying the LLMs to incorporate specific knowledge, without negatively influencing other irrelevant knowledge. In this survey, we aim at providing a comprehensive and in-depth overview of recent advances in the field of KME. We first introduce a general formulation of KME to encompass different KME strategies. Afterward, we provide an innovative taxonomy of KME techniques based on how the new knowledge is introduced into pre-trained LLMs, and investigate existing KME strategies while analyzing key insights, advantages, and limitations of methods from each category. Moreover, representative metrics, datasets, and applications of KME are introduced accordingly. Finally, we provide an in-depth analysis regarding the practicality and remaining challenges of KME and suggest promising research directions for further advancement in this field.

AB Hydrazides are known to catalyze reactions of alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehydes via transient iminium formation. The iminium intermediate displays enhanced electrophilicity, which facilitates conjugate additions and cycloadditions. We observed that a hydrazide embedded in a seven-membered ring catalyzes homoaldol condensation of a simple aldehyde in a process that displays an approximate second-order dependence on the hydrazide. This finding suggests a dual activation mechanism involving both iminium and enamine intermediates. The unexpected nucleophilic activation mode led us to examine a series of simple dihydrazides for bifunctional catalysis of the aldol condensation. The two cyclic hydrazide units were connected via linear polymethylene linkers, which are inherently flexible. Substantial increases in initial reaction rate, relative to a monohydrazide, were observed for polymethylene linkers of sufficient length, with a maximum at 10 methylenes. Reactions promoted by this dihydrazide displayed an approximate first-order dependence on catalyst concentration, which suggested a bifunctional catalytic mechanism. Even for a dihydrazide with an 18-methylene linker, a substantial increase in relative initial rate was observed. These observations show that significant coordination can be achieved between two catalytically active moieties even when these moieties are connected via many flexible bonds.

AB Landslides are widespread natural hazards which take a heavy toll on lives, property, and infrastructure each year. In January 2023 and 2024, widespread landslides occurred in California as a result of extreme winter precipitation. Estimating the regional evolution of landslide hazard in a changing climate is essential for adaptation planning and risk mitigation efforts. The complex effects of climate change on landslide hazard, however, are poorly understood. Here, we use climate and landslide observations to develop a novel data-driven approach for landslide susceptibility assessment under historical and future climate conditions. We apply this framework to investigate the evolution of landslide susceptibility in California and its impacts on the roadway system based on downscaled climate projections under moderate and high greenhouse gas emission scenarios. On average, the results indicate an increase in landslide susceptibility through 2100 in regions where historical susceptibility is moderate to very high. Although the spatio-temporal variations in landslide susceptibility are sensitive to climate model uncertainties in predicting extreme rainfall, the direst impacts are largely circumvented in lower emission scenarios.

AB Gradient coding is a method for mitigating straggling servers in a centralized computing network that uses erasure-coding techniques to distributively carry out first-order optimization methods. Randomized numerical linear algebra uses randomization to develop improved algorithms for large-scale linear algebra computations. In this paper, we propose a method for distributed optimization that combines gradient coding and randomized numerical linear algebra. The proposed method uses a randomized $\ell _{2}$ -subspace embedding and a gradient coding technique to distribute blocks of data to the computational nodes of a centralized network, and at each iteration the central server only requires a small number of computations to obtain the steepest descent update. The novelty of our approach is that the data is replicated according to importance scores, called block leverage scores, in contrast to most gradient coding approaches that uniformly replicate the data blocks. Furthermore, we do not require a decoding step at each iteration, avoiding a bottleneck in previous gradient coding schemes. We show that our approach results in a valid $\ell _{2}$ -subspace embedding, and that our resulting approximation converges to the optimal solution.

AB Africa's continental crust hosts a variety of geologic terrains and is crucial for understanding the evolution of its longest-lived cratons. However, few of its seismological models are yet to incorporate the largest continent-wide noise dispersion data sets. Here, we report on new insights into Africa's crustal architecture obtained using a new data set and model assessment product, ADAMA, which comprises a large ensemble of short-period surface wave dispersion measurements: 5-40 s. We construct a continent-wide model of Africa's Crust Evaluated with ADAMA's Rayleigh Phase maps (ACE-ADAMA-RP). Dispersion maps, and uncertainties, are obtained with a probabilistic approach. This model update, and a crustal taxonomy derived from unsupervised machine learning, reveals that the architecture of Africa's crust can be classified into two main types: primitive (C1: faster velocities with little gradients) and modified (C2-C4: slower velocities in the shallow crust with more pronounced gradients). The Archean shields are "primitive," showing little variation or secular evolution. The basins, orogens, and continental margins are "modified" and retain imprints of surface deformation. The crustal taxonomy is obtained without a-priori geological information and differs from previous classification schemes. While most of our reported features are robust, probabilistic modeling suggests caution in the quantitative interpretations where illumination is compromised by low-quality measurements, sparse coverage or both. Future extension of our approach to other complementary seismological and geophysical data sets-for example, multimode earthquake dispersion, receiver functions, gravity, and mineral physics, will enable continent-wide lithospheric modeling that extends resolution to the upper mantle.
   The rocks that constitute Africa's crust record the history of different geological periods. We produce a map, for the entire continent, of how fast shear waves travel within these rocks. We obtain this map from ambient noise surface wave vibrations. The ambient noise surface waves are generated from ocean and atmospheric waves that couple with the solid Earth. There are two types: Rayleigh and Love waves and they travel at different speeds for different wavelengths. This property is called dispersion and it is used to tell how fast the shear wave speeds travel within the subsurface rocks. Constructing the final map from ambient noise surface waves requires the solution of a computational imaging problem. We solve the most challenging computational task with a probabilistic approach-using random sampling-and this enables us to also construct associated error maps. The new maps of Africa's crust show new features that have important implications for subsurface geology of the continent.

AB Multimaterial aerosol jet printing offers a unique capability to freely mix inks with different chemical compositions in the aerosol phase, enabling one-step digital fabrication with tailored compositions or functionally graded structures, including in the x-y plane. Here, in situ mixing of two carbon nanomaterial inks with distinct electrical properties is demonstrated. By tailoring the mixing ratio of the constituent inks, electrical conductivity is modulated by 130x, and sheet resistance values for a single pass span approximately 2 orders of magnitude. The ability to manufacture components with tailored electrical properties offers significant value for hybrid and flexible electronic device applications, such as microelectronics packaging. Moreover, grading properties within a part provides a new dimension of design freedom for complex assemblies.

AB Air bubble injection has been a widely studied method for reducing frictional drag in fluid flows, especially in the marine industry. However, the lack of control over air bubble stability, size, and shape has hindered its widespread adoption. This study investigates the use of laser-based surface wettability modification techniques to address these challenges by enhancing control over air bubble behavior in water flows. We processed metal plates using nanosecond laser and chemical immersion to create wettability patterns consisting of regions of either superhydrophobicity or superhydrophilicity. Water tunnel experiments were conducted to observe the behavior of air bubbles over these different wettability patterns. The results revealed that surface wettability can be used to control the size and spatial distribution of air bubbles, which can enhance the energy cost-benefit of drag reduction methods in the marine industry. Moreover, this research offers new insights into the potential of laser-based surface wettability modification as a solution for improving the control of air bubble behavior in large-scale applications.
