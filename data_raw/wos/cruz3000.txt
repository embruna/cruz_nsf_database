TI Double-free-layer stochastic magnetic tunnel junctions with synthetic
   antiferromagnets
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED
LA English
DT Article
AB Stochastic magnetic tunnel junctions (SMTJs) using low-barrier nanomagnets have shown promise as fast, energy-efficient, and scalable building blocks for probabilistic computing. Despite recent experimental and theoretical progress, SMTJs exhibiting the ideal characteristics necessary for probabilistic bits (p-bits) are still lacking. Ideally, the SMTJs should have (a) voltage bias independence, preventing read disturbance; (b) uniform randomness in the magnetization angle between the two magnetic layers; and (c) fast fluctuations without requiring external magnetic fields, while being robust to magnetic field perturbations. Here, we propose a design that satisfies all of these requirements, using double-free-layer SMTJs with synthetic antiferromagnets (SAFs). We evaluate the proposed SMTJ design with experimentally benchmarked spin-circuit models, accounting for transport physics, coupled with the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation for magnetization dynamics. We find that the use of low-barrier SAF layers reduces dipolar coupling, achieving uncorrelated fluctuations at zero-magnetic field, surviving up to diameters exceeding D approximate to 100 nm if the nanomagnets can be made thin enough (approximate to 1-2 nm). The double-free-layer structure retains bias independence and the circular nature of the nanomagnets provides near-uniform randomness with fast fluctuations. Combining our full SMTJ model with advanced transistor models, we estimate the energy to generate a random bit to be about 3.6 fJ, with fluctuation rates of about 3.3 GHz per p-bit. Our results will guide the experimental development of superior stochastic magnetic tunnel junctions for large-scale and energy-efficient probabilistic computation for problems relevant to machine learning and artificial intelligence.

AB Metal nanoparticles have been widely employed in chemical sensing due to their high reactivity toward various gases. The size of the metal nanoparticles often dictates their reactivity and hence their performance as chemiresistive sensors. Herein, we report that iptycene-containing poly(arylene ether)s (PAEs) have been shown to limit the growth of palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) and stabilize the Pd NPs dispersion. These porous PAEs also facilitate the efficient transport of analytes. Single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT)-based chemiresistors and graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs) using these PAE-supported small Pd NPs are sensitive, selective, and robust sensory materials for hydrogen gas under ambient conditions. Generalizable strategies including presorting SWCNTs with pentiptycene-containing poly(p-phenylene ethynylene)s (PPEs) and thermal annealing demonstrated significant improvements in the chemiresistive performance. The polymer:NP colloids produced in this study are readily synthesized and solution processable, and these methods are of general utility.

AB An 18-month pilot study evaluated the feasibility of flow reversal reverse osmosis (FR-RO) for municipal wastewater reuse. FR-RO was tested with three feed water sources and in two configurations (primary RO and brine concentrator modes) focusing on recovery, water permeability, fouling rate, salt rejection, and chemical cleaning intervals. Initially, the FR-RO pilot treated microfiltration/ultrafiltration (MF/UF) effluent as a three-stage RO with flow reversal. Optimization trials achieved 90 % instantaneous recovery at 19.7 LMH (11.6 gfd), demonstrating stable water permeability and salt rejection over three months. Next, the pilot treated RO concentrate as a one-stage brine concentrator, reaching similar to 45 % recovery at 8.5 LMH (5.0 gfd) but experiencing rapid membrane fouling, high chemical usage, and bromination damage to the membrane's active layer. Brine concentrator mode was only viable for two months; long-term operation proved unsuccessful due to poor cleanability. Finally, pilot performance was validated to treat MF/UF effluent again (primary RO mode) after the source water from the full-scale facility began incorporating an additional secondary effluent with greater salinity. Nevertheless, extended operation achieved 90 % recovery and a 3-month runtime between membrane cleanings with acceptable membrane-normalized salt rejection. A site-specific, preliminary cost analysis suggested that a retrofitted FR-RO operating at 90 % recovery would have a combined (capital plus O&M) unit cost of $0.25/m(3) ($308 per acre-foot or AF) (considering only the RO portion of the potable reuse treatment train) compared to $0.21/m(3) ($259/AF) for a conventional (no flow reversal) RO unit. Overall, the pilot study provided insights into the feasibility and challenges of FR-RO technology for municipal potable reuse, informing potential retrofitting of conventional RO systems.

AB Superlubricity, or near zero friction is a highly desired lubrication state for a wide range of practical applications. Although such application scenarios often involve complex contact geometries, solid lubricant technologies, including previous efforts on achieving superlubricity, are almost entirely in linear sliding test conditions. This report demonstrates an experimental pathway to yield superlubricity in rolling-sliding contact conditions using solid-lubricant materials. Ti3C2X based solid lubricant was tested under complex sliding-rolling conditions at engineering-significant contact pressures. The material's compression and inter-layer shearing result in material reconstruction to pose superlubricity. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy analysis, complemented by multi-scan Raman spectroscopy showed the formation of a robust amorphous tribolayer. This demonstration is expected to not only advance the applied aspects in the development of oil-free solid lubricants but also push the boundaries of fundamental understanding of materials' structure-property relations across physical states.

AB A key scientific challenge during the outbreak of novel infectious diseases is to predict how the course of the epidemic changes under countermeasures that limit interaction in the population. Most epidemiological models do not consider the role of mutations and heterogeneity in the type of contact events. However, pathogens have the capacity to mutate in response to changing environments, especially caused by the increase in population immunity to existing strains, and the emergence of new pathogen strains poses a continued threat to public health. Further, in the light of differing transmission risks in different congregate settings (e.g., schools and offices), different mitigation strategies may need to be adopted to control the spread of infection. We analyze a multilayer multistrain model by simultaneously accounting for i) pathways for mutations in the pathogen leading to the emergence of new pathogen strains, and ii) differing transmission risks in different settings, modeled as network layers. Assuming complete cross-immunity among strains, namely, recovery from any infection prevents infection with any other (an assumption that will need to be relaxed to deal with COVID-19 or influenza), we derive the key epidemiological parameters for the multilayer multistrain framework. We demonstrate that reductions to existing models that discount heterogeneity in either the strain or the network layers may lead to incorrect predictions. Our results highlight that the impact of imposing/lifting mitigation measures concerning different contact network layers (e.g., school closures or work-from-home policies) should be evaluated in connection with their effect on the likelihood of the emergence of new strains.

ID DOCUMENTATION; PROJECTS
AB Effectively onboarding newcomers is essential for the success of open source projects. These projects often provide onboarding guidelines in their 'CONTRIBUTING' files (e.g., CONTRIBUTING.md on GitHub). These files explain, for example, how to find open tasks, implement solutions, and submit code for review. However, these files often do not follow a standard structure, can be too large, and miss barriers commonly found by newcomers. In this paper, we propose an automated approach to parse these CONTRIBUTING files and assess how they address onboarding barriers. We manually classified a sample of files according to a model of onboarding barriers from the literature, trained a machine learning classifier that automatically predicts the categories of each paragraph (precision: 0.655, recall: 0.662), and surveyed developers to investigate their perspective of the predictions' adequacy (75% of the predictions were considered adequate). We found that CONTRIBUTING files typically do not cover the barriers newcomers face (52% of the analyzed projects missed at least 3 out of the 6 barriers faced by newcomers; 84% missed at least 2). Our analysis also revealed that information about choosing a task and talking with the community, two of the most recurrent barriers newcomers face, are neglected in more than 75% of the projects. We made available our classifier as an online service that analyzes the content of a given CONTRIBUTING file. Our approach may help community builders identify missing information in the project ecosystem they maintain and newcomers can understand what to expect in CONTRIBUTING files.

AB Ammonia decomposition is a key reaction in the context of hydrogen storage, transport, and release. This study combines density functional theory (DFT) calculations with microkinetic modeling to address the promotion mechanism of Ba species for ammonia decomposition on Co catalysts. The modified adsorption properties of Co upon the addition of metallic Ba or BaO suggest that the promoters play a role in alleviating the competitive adsorption of H. Calculating the full reaction pathway of ammonia decomposition shows that limiting the investigation to the N-N association step, as done previously, overlooks the effect of the promoter on the energy barriers of the NHx x dehydrogenation steps. Challenges of modeling the ammonia decomposition reaction are addressed by understanding that the NH2 2 intermediate is stabilized on the step sites rather than the terrace sites. When the effect of H-coverage on the adsorption of NH3 3 is not considered in the microkinetic simulations, the results conflict with the experiments. However, accounting for the effect of H-coverage, as performed here, shows that BaO-doped Co has higher rates than pristine Co and Ba-doped Co at the reaction temperature of 723.15 K. When H is adsorbed on the Ba-doped Co, the adsorption of ammonia becomes significantly endergonic, which makes the rates relatively slow. The superiority of the BaO-promoted catalyst is attributed to a lower energy for the transition state of the rate-determining step, coupled with a reduced impact of the hydrogen coverage on weakening the ammonia adsorption. The kinetic analysis of the influence of Ba and BaO on the Co surface shows that BaO-doped Co aligns more closely with experimental observations than Badoped Co. This implies that Ba on the Co surface is likely to be in an oxide form under reaction conditions. Understanding the kinetics of the ammonia decomposition reaction provides a foundation for developing highly effective catalysts to accelerate the industrial utilization of ammonia as a sustainable hydrogen carrier.

AB Turkevich syntheses represent a foundational approach for forming colloids of monodisperse gold nanoparticles where the use of these structures as building blocks when forming multicomponent nanoassemblies is pervasive. The core-satellite motif, which is characterized by a central core structure onto which satellite structures are tethered, distinguishes itself in that it can realize numerous plasmonic nanogaps with nanometer scale widths. Established procedures for assembling these multicomponent structures are, to a large extent, empirically driven, time-consuming, difficult to reproduce, and in need of a strong mechanistic underpinning relating to the close-range electrostatic interactions needed to secure satellite structures onto core materials. Described herein is a rapid, repeatable procedure for assembling core-satellite structures using Turkevich-grown satellites and dithiol linkers. With this successful procedure acting as a baseline for benchmarking modified procedures, a rather complex parameter space is understood in terms of timeline requirements for various processing steps and an analysis of the factors that prove consequential to assembly. It is shown that seemingly innocuous procedures realize sparsely populated cores whereas cores initially obstructed with commonly used capping agents lead to few disruptions to satellite attachment. Once these factors are placed under control, then it is the ionic strength imposed by the reaction biproducts of the Turkevich synthesis that is the critical factor in assembly because they decide the spatial extent of the electrical double layer surrounding each colloidal nanoparticle. With this understanding, it is possible to control the ionic strength through the addition or subtraction of various ionic species and assert control over the assembly process. The work, hence, advances the rules for a robust core-satellite assembly process and, in a broader sense, contributes to the knowhow required for the precise, programmable, and controllable assembly of multicomponent systems.
   Gold cores functionalized with dithiol linkers are densely populated with Turkevich-synthesized satellite nanoparticles in under thirty minutes at 100% yield using procedures that promote rapid assembly while avoiding potential pitfalls.

AB Let K be a rationally null-homologous knot in a 3-manifold Y, equipped with a nonzero framing A, and let YA.(K) denote the result of A-framed surgery on Y. Ozsvath and Szabo gave a formula for the Heegaard Floer homology groups of YA.(K) in terms of the knot Floer complex of (Y, K). We strengthen this formula by adding a second filtration that computes the knot Floer complex of the dual knot Ka in Ya, i.e., the core circle of the surgery solid torus. In the course of proving our refinement we derive a combinatorial formula for the Alexander grading which may be of independent interest.

AB Hydrologic controls on the timing of sediment transport and sediment hysteresis patterns remain an open area of investigation in hydrology, especially for low-gradient watersheds with substantial instream sediment deposition. Sediment hysteresis, which describes the mismatch between hydrograph peak and sedigraph peak, aids with elucidation of the mechanisms of sediment transport in watersheds. Most frequently, the controls of hysteresis are attributed to the proximity of sediment sources to monitoring locations in a watershed. However, this assumption, while widely applied, is infrequently verified. We investigated the controls of sediment hysteresis in a low gradient system located in the Bluegrass Region of central Kentucky, USA. Turbidity and conductivity sensors installed at the basin outlet provided data to quantify sediment hysteresis and separate hydrologic flow pathways (i.e., by describing the source of water delivered to the watershed's outlet) using a tracer-based approach. Predictive hydrologic parameters, including hydrologic pathways, event magnitude, and antecedent conditions, were estimated and grouped based on hydrologic similitude. Thereafter, we identified parameters required to predict sediment hysteresis using a tailored ensemble feature selection approach coupled with three machine learning algorithms-Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Gradient Boosted Trees. Results from the analysis of 68 storm events occurring over a two-year period showed that clockwise events accounted for 85 % of the total sediment yield despite comprising only 53 % of the events. The hysteresis index (HI) can be predicted (r = 0.8, RMSE = 0.12) using three, out of the thirty-nine hydrologic parameters considered. The most important predictors of HI reflect the volume of event rainfall and the relative proportions of new water (i.e., water derived from precipitation during the storm event) and old water (i.e., water previously stored in the watershed) comprising the hydrograph. Further analyses reveal that new water timing-which changes with the rainfall volume-and sediment timing are closely linked, suggesting that variations in the hysteresis patterns are controlled by changes in the response time of fast flowing water pathways. This implies that hydrologic pathways, as opposed to sediment proximity to the watershed outlet, control sediment hysteresis in this watershed. These results have important implications for better understanding the mechanisms controlling sediment transport at the watershed scale.

TI How barriers become invisible: Children are less sensitive to
   constraints that are stable over time
SO DEVELOPMENTAL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE constraints; preferences; social inference
ID PREFERENCES; INFER
AB When making inferences about the mental lives of others (e.g., others' preferences), it is critical to consider the extent to which the choices we observe are constrained. Prior research on the development of this tendency indicates a contradictory pattern: Children show remarkable sensitivity to constraints in traditional experimental paradigms, yet often fail to consider real-world constraints and privilege inherent causes instead. We propose that one explanation for this discrepancy may be that real-world constraints are often stable over time and lose their salience. The present research tested whether children (N = 133, 5- to 12-year-old mostly US children; 55% female, 45% male) become less sensitive to an actor's constraints after first observing two constrained actors (Stable condition) versus after first observing two actors in contexts with greater choice (Not Stable condition). We crossed the stability of the constraint with the type of constraint: either the constraint was deterministic such that there was only one option available (No Other Option constraint) or, in line with many real-world constraints, the constraint was probabilistic such that there was another option, but it was difficult to access (Hard to Access constraint). Results indicated that children in the Stable condition became less sensitive to the probabilistic Hard to Access constraint across trials. Notably, we also found that children's sensitivity to constraints was enhanced in the Not Stable condition regardless of whether the constraint was probabilistic or deterministic. We discuss implications for children's sensitivity to real-world constraints.Research Highlights This research addresses the apparent contradiction that children are sensitive to constraints in experimental paradigms but are often insensitive to constraints in the real world. One explanation for this discrepancy is that constraints in the real world tend to be stable over time and may lose their salience. When probabilistic constraints (i.e., when a second option is available but hard to access) are stable, children become de-sensitized to constraints across trials. First observing contexts with greater choice increases children's sensitivity to both probabilistic and deterministic constraints.

TI Extracting accurate materials data from research papers with
   conversational language models and prompt engineering
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
AB There has been a growing effort to replace manual extraction of data from research papers with automated data extraction based on natural language processing, language models, and recently, large language models (LLMs). Although these methods enable efficient extraction of data from large sets of research papers, they require a significant amount of up-front effort, expertise, and coding. In this work, we propose the ChatExtract method that can fully automate very accurate data extraction with minimal initial effort and background, using an advanced conversational LLM. ChatExtract consists of a set of engineered prompts applied to a conversational LLM that both identify sentences with data, extract that data, and assure the data's correctness through a series of follow-up questions. These follow-up questions largely overcome known issues with LLMs providing factually inaccurate responses. ChatExtract can be applied with any conversational LLMs and yields very high quality data extraction. In tests on materials data, we find precision and recall both close to 90% from the best conversational LLMs, like GPT-4. We demonstrate that the exceptional performance is enabled by the information retention in a conversational model combined with purposeful redundancy and introducing uncertainty through follow-up prompts. These results suggest that approaches similar to ChatExtract, due to their simplicity, transferability, and accuracy are likely to become powerful tools for data extraction in the near future. Finally, databases for critical cooling rates of metallic glasses and yield strengths of high entropy alloys are developed using ChatExtract.
   Efficient data extraction from research papers accelerates science and engineering. Here, the authors develop an automated approach which uses conversational large language models to achieve high precision and recall in extracting materials data.

AB The topology of turbulent coherent structures is known to regulate the transport of energy, mass and momentum in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). While previous research has primarily focused on characterizing the structure of turbulence in stationary ABL flows, real-world scenarios frequently deviate from stationarity, giving rise to nuanced and poorly understood changes in the turbulence geometry and associated transport mechanisms. This study sheds light on this problem by examining topological changes in ABL turbulence induced by non-stationarity and their effects on momentum transport. Results from a large-eddy simulation of pulsatile open channel flow over an array of surface-mounted cuboids are examined. The analysis reveals that the flow pulsation triggers a phase-dependent shear rate, and the ejection-sweep pattern varies with the shear rate during the pulsatile cycle. From a turbulence structure perspective, it is attributed to the changes in the geometry of hairpin vortices. An increase (decrease) in the shear rate intensifies (relaxes) these structures, leading to an increase (decrease) in the frequency of ejections and an amplification (reduction) of their percentage contribution to the total momentum flux. Furthermore, the size of the hairpin packets undergoes variations, which depend on the geometry of the constituting hairpin vortices, yet the packet inclination preserves its orientation throughout the pulsatile cycle. These observations reinforce the important role non-stationarity holds in shaping the structure of ABL turbulence and the momentum transport mechanisms it governs.

AB How do people come to opposite causal judgments about societal problems, such as whether a public health policy reduced COVID-19 cases? The current research tests an understudied cognitive mechanism in which people may agree about what actually happened (e.g., that a public health policy was implemented and COVID-19 cases declined), but can be made to disagree about the counterfactual, or what would have happened otherwise (e.g., whether COVID-19 cases would have declined naturally without intervention) via comparison cases. Across two preregistered studies (total N = 480), participants reasoned about the implementation of a public policy that was followed by an immediate decline in novel virus cases. Study 1 shows that people's judgments about the causal impact of the policy could be pushed in opposite directions by emphasizing comparison cases that imply different counterfactual outcomes. Study 2 finds that people recognize they can use such information to influence others. Specifically, in service of persuading others to support or reject a public health policy, people systematically showed comparison cases implying the counterfactual outcome that aligned with their position. These findings were robust across samples of U.S. college students and politically and socioeconomically diverse U.S. adults. Together, these studies suggest that implied counterfactuals are a powerful tool that individuals can use to manufacture others' causal judgments and warrant further investigation as a mechanism contributing to belief polarization.

AB Dense simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is crucial for robotics and augmented reality applications. However, current methods are often hampered by the non-volumetric or implicit way they represent a scene. This work introduces SplaTAM, an approach that, for the first time, leverages explicit volumetric representations, i.e., 3D Gaussians, to enable high-fidelity reconstruction from a sin-gle unposed RGB-D camera, surpassing the capabilities of existing methods. SplaTAM employs a simple online tracking and mapping system tailored to the underlying Gaussian representation. It utilizes a silhouette mask to elegantly capture the presence of scene density. This combination enables several benefits over prior representations, including fast rendering and dense optimization, quickly determin-ing if areas have been previously mapped, and structured map expansion by adding more Gaussians. Extensive experiments show that SplaTAM achieves up to 2x superior way for more immersive high-fidelity SLAM applications performance in camera pose estimation, map construction, and novel-view synthesis over existing methods, paving the.

AB The accurate description of electronic properties and optical absorption spectra is a long-standing challenge for density functional theory. Recently, the introduction of screened range-separated hybrid (SRSH) functionals for solid-state materials has allowed for the calculation of fundamental band gaps and optical absorption spectra that are in very good agreement with many-body perturbation theory. However, since solid-state SRSH functionals are typically tuned to reproduce the properties of bulk phases, their transferability to low-dimensional structures, which experience substantially different screening than in the bulk, remains an open question. In this work, we explore the transferability of SRSH functionals to several prototypical van der Waals materials, including transition-metal sulfides and selenides, indium selenide, black phosphorus, and hexagonal boron nitride. Considering the bulk and a monolayer of these materials as limiting cases, we show that the parameters of the SRSH functional can be determined systematically, using only the band-edge quasiparticle energies of these extremal structural phases as fitting targets. The resulting SRSH functionals can describe both electronic band structures and optical absorption spectra with accuracy comparable to more demanding ab initio many-body perturbation theory (GW and Bethe-Salpeter equation) approaches. Selected examples also demonstrate that the SRSH parameters, obtained from the bulk and monolayer reference structures, display good accuracy for band structures and optical spectra of bilayers, indicating a degree of transferability that is independent of the fitting procedure.

AB Little is known about the reproductive biology of the leopard seal (Hydrurga leptonyx), a Southern Ocean predator. Here we observed sexual behavior in wild leopard seals in Laguna San Rafael, Chile during a 2 h courtship interaction between a female and male. The female was hauled out on ice, mostly lying still (69% of the time) or moving (19%). The male was mostly under water (87%) or at the water's surface (11%). The female made seven in-air calls (i.e., thump pulse, noseblast, blast, growl). The male produced 65 underwater calls (i.e., low- and high-double trills, unidentified trills). The underwater calls appeared to be directed toward the female. After the primary male vocalized for an hour, one or two unidentified leopard seals briefly swam near the female. After leaving the area, we heard underwater calls for another 8 h. The next day, the primary male was hauled out on ice with a swollen genital opening. The male was bleeding from a laceration caudal to the preputial opening, suggesting the male attempted to mate and that the female, or another seal, was responsible for the injury. Together, we find that leopard seal courtship involves a suite of behavioral and acoustic behaviors by both sexes, both in air and under water. This is the first description of leopard seal sexual behavior in the wild. Our study also provides the first evidence that leopard seals mate in South America.

AB Non-stationarity is the rule in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). Under such conditions, the flow may experience departures from equilibrium with the underlying surface stress, misalignment of shear stresses and strain rates, and three-dimensionality in turbulence statistics. Existing ABL flow theories are primarily established for statistically stationary flow conditions and cannot predict such behaviours. Motivated by this knowledge gap, this study analyses the impact of time-varying pressure gradients on mean flow and turbulence over urban-like surfaces. A series of large-eddy simulations of pulsatile flow over cuboid arrays is performed, programmatically varying the oscillation amplitude alpha and forcing frequency omega. The analysis focuses on both longtime-averaged and phase-dependent flow dynamics. Inspection of longtime-averaged velocity profiles reveals that the aerodynamic roughness length z(0) increases with alpha and omega, whereas the displacement height d appears to be insensitive to these parameters. In terms of oscillatory flow statistics, it is found that alpha primarily controls the oscillation amplitude of the streamwise velocity and Reynolds stresses, but has a negligible impact on their wall-normal structure. On the other hand, omega determines the size of the region affected by the unsteady forcing, which identifies the so-called Stokes layer thickness delta(s). Within the Stokes layer, phase-averaged resolved Reynolds stress profiles feature substantial variations during the pulsatile cycle, and the turbulence is out of equilibrium with the mean flow. Two phenomenological models have been proposed that capture the influence of flow unsteadiness on z(0) and delta(s), respectively.

AB Magnetic fields play a crucial role in star formation, yet tracing them becomes particularly challenging, especially in the presence of outflow feedback in protostellar systems. We targeted the star-forming region L1551, notable for its apparent outflows, to investigate the magnetic fields. These fields were probed using polarimetry observations from the Planck satellite at 353 GHz/849 mu m, the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy's (SOFIA) High-resolution Airborne Wide-band Camera (HAWC+ ) measurement at 214 mu m, and the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope's (JCMT) Submillimetre Common-User POLarimeter (SCUPOL) 850 mu m survey. Consistently, all three measurements show that the magnetic fields twist towards the protostar IRS 5. Additionally, we utilized the velocity gradient technique on the (CO)-C-12 (J = 1-0) emission data to distinguish the magnetic fields directly associated with the protostellar outflows. These were then compared with the polarization results. Notably, in the outskirts of the region, these measurements generally align. However, as one approaches the centre of IRS 5, the measurements tend to yield mostly perpendicular relative orientations. This suggests that the outflows might be dynamically significant from a scale of similar to 0.2 pc, causing the velocity gradient to change direction by 90 degrees. Furthermore, we discovered that the polarization fraction p and the total intensity I correlate as p proportional to I-alpha. Specifically, alpha is approximately 1.044 +/- 0.06 for SCUPOL and around 0.858 +/- 0.15 for HAWC+. This indicates that the outflows could significantly impact the alignment of dust grains and magnetic fields in the L1551 region.

AB Large-amplitude current-driven plasma instabilities, which can transition to the Buneman instability, were observed in one-dimensional simulations to generate high-energy back-streaming ions. We investigate the saturation of multi-dimensional plasma instabilities and its effects on energetic ion formation. Such ions directly impact spacecraft thruster lifetimes and are associated with magnetic reconnection and cosmic ray inception. An Eulerian Vlasov-Poisson solver employing the grid-based direct kinetic method is used to study the growth and saturation of 2D2V collisionless, electrostatic current-driven instabilities spanning two dimensions each in the configuration (D) and velocity (V) spaces supporting ion and electron phase-space transport. Four stages characterise the electric potential evolution in such instabilities: linear modal growth, harmonic growth, accelerated growth via quasi-linear mechanisms alongside nonlinear fill-in and saturated turbulence. Its transition and isotropisation process bears considerable similarities to the development of hydrodynamic turbulence. While a tendency to isotropy is observed in the plasma waves, followed by electron and then ion phase spaces after several ion-acoustic periods, the formation of energetic back-streaming ions is more limited in the 2D2V than in the 1D1V simulations. Plasma waves formed by two-dimensional electrostatic kinetic instabilities can propagate in the direction perpendicular to the net electron drift. Thus, large-amplitude multi-dimensional waves generate high-energy transverse-streaming ions and eventually limit energetic backward-streaming ions along the longitudinal direction. The multi-dimensional study sheds light on interactions between longitudinal and transverse electrostatic plasma instabilities, as well as fundamental characteristics of the inception and sustenance of unmagnetised plasma turbulence.

AB Extreme heat is a current and growing global health concern. Current heat exposure models include meteorological and human factors that dictate heat stress, comfort, and risk of illness. However, radiation models simplify the human body to a cylinder, while convection ones provide conflicting predictions. To address these issues, we introduce a new method to characterize human exposure to extreme heat with unprecedented detail. We measure heat loads on 35 body surface zones using an outdoor thermal manikin ("ANDI") alongside an ultrasonic anemometer array and integral radiation measurements (IRM). We show that regardless of body orientation, IRM and ANDI agree even under high solar conditions. Further, body parts can be treated as cylinders, even in highly turbulent flow. This geometry-rooted insight yields a whole-body convection correlation that resolves prior conflicts and is valid for diverse indoor and outdoor wind flows. Results will inform decisionmaking around heat protection, adaptation, and mitigation.

AB As rates of textile manufacturing and disposal escalate, the ramifications to health and the environment through water pollution, microplastic contaminant concentrations, and greenhouse gas emissions increase. Discarding over 15.4 million tons of textiles each year, the U.S. recycles less than 15%, sending the remainder to landfills and incinerators. Textile reuse is not sufficient to de-escalate the situation; recycling is necessary. Most textile recycling technologies from past decades are expensive, create low-quality outputs, or are not industry scalable. For viability, textile recycling system designs must evolve with the rapid pace of a dynamic textile and fashion industry. For any design to be sustainable, it must also be flexible to adapt to technological, user, societal, and environmental condition advances. To this end, flexible and sustainable design principles were compared: overlapping principles were combined and missing principles were added to create 12 overarching principles encompassing design for sustainability and flexibility (DfSFlex). The Fiber Shredder was designed and built with flexibility and sustainability as its goal and evaluated on how well it met DfSFlex principles. An evaluation of the Fiber Shredder's performance found that increased speed and processing time increase the generation of the desired output-fibers and yarns-manifesting the principles of Design for Separation in design and Facilitate Resource Recovery in processing. The development of this technology, with the application of sustainable and flexible design, fiber-to-fiber recycling using mechanical systems appears promising for maintaining value while repurposing textiles.

AB During cycling activities, cyclists often focus on pedestrians, vehicles or road conditions in front of their bicycle. Because of this forward focus, approaching vehicles from behind can easily be missed, which can result in accidents, injury, or death. Although rear information can viewed with handle-mounted mirrors or monitors, looking down can distract the cyclist from other hazards.
   To help address this problem, we present the ReAR Indicator, a peripheral information delivery approach that enhances awareness of rear-approaching vehicles and at the same time preserves forward vision. ReAR uses computer vision applied to a rear-facing RGB-D camera and combines it with position data from a head mounted display for real-time vehicle detection and visualization. Our algorithm delivers information to the periphery such that the user can simultaneously view forward information but still use cues that provide information about hazard distance, width, and probability of collision. Results from a virtual reality based experiment with 20 participants showed that the ReAR Indicator helped cyclists maintain a forward focus while still avoiding collisions with rear-approaching vehicles and in some conditions either matched or outperformed 3D arrows and virtual monitors.

AB Consumption of contaminated water can have detrimental effects on the health of every living organism on earth. There is, thus, a need to develop novel materials and technologies to purify water. Water is also a source of hydrogen, a clean renewable fuel that can be generated through the action of a photoactive catalyst and the earth's abundant solar energy. Using photocatalysis, we can purify water by removing organic pollutants through the photodegradation reaction (oxidation) and produce hydrogen (H2) through the hydrogen evolution reaction (reduction). However, we can combine these two reactions in a single process to achieve an efficient photocatalytic system. Herein, we report the dual-functional photocatalysis (DFP) on herbicide-contaminated water using TiO2 polymorphs derived from the amino-functionalized metal-organic framework (MOF), MIL-125-NH2. Heteroatom TiO2 doping led to the generation of N-and N,S-doped TiO2. Of all the pristine and doped TiO2 phases synthesized, the N,S-doped anatase (NSTA) was the best dual-functional photocatalyst in degrading glyphosate (PMG) with simultaneous H2 production at a rate of 660 mu mol g-1 h-1. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance studies indicate the preferential cleaving of PMG's C-N bonds, here referred to as alpha and beta C-N bonds, leading to the formation of glycine, formic acid, and phosphoric acid as the major degradation products. Density functional theory calculations indicate PMG's activation through the carboxy and phosphoric acid groups on the surface of NSTA and through the phosphoric acid group on the surface of TiO2-rutile. Our results suggest that the catalytic activity of NSTA can be attributed to the templated impact of the parent MOF, owing to its porosity, redshifting of the band absorption edge toward the visible region, reduced energy bandgap, surface defects, and the presence of oxygen vacancies. The binding mode of PMG to NSTA and its degradation allowed us to test the photodegradation of other herbicides, such as glufosinate ammonium and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid. Interestingly, our MOF-derived NSTA proved to be active in purifying water when all three herbicides were combined and produced H2 with a rate of 329 mu mol g-1 h-1 simultaneously.

AB Metallic nanoparticles have been demonstrated to be versatile photocatalysts, as exemplified by those made from noble and precious metals. Transitioning from precious to earth-abundant metals for sustainable photocatalysis requires benchmarking their catalytic performance. In this work, we attempt to compare the photocatalytic activities of Au, Pd, and Co-B nanoparticles in the reduction of nitrobenzene by hydrazine. Despite their different morphologies and surface structures, Co-B nanoparticles offer the highest catalytic enhancement when comparing their reaction rates under irradiation to those under nonirradiation conditions. The trend of improved photocatalytic performance when transitioning from Au to Pd, and then to Co-B, can be explained by the nature of their d-band positions and corresponding hot carriers photogenerated from interband transitions.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Federated Learning (FL) Services enable customers (requesters) to outsource their FL tasks to the FL service provider, who will recruit a group of clients with appropriate datasets to complete the FL task. For a given FL task, how to select appropriate clients fairly becomes a challenging problem due to budget restrictions and client heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose a new client selection, scheduling, and rewarding scheme to ensure fairness through a three-stage process: 1) multi-criteria initial client pool selection, 2) data quality-oriented perround client scheduling, and 3) performance-based rewarding. Specifically, we first define a client selection metric with multiple criteria, such as client resources, data quality, and client behaviors. Then, we formulate the initial client pool selection problem into an optimization problem that aims to maximize the overall scores of selected clients within a given budget and propose a greedy algorithm to solve it. Furthermore, we formulate the per-round client selection problem into a data quality-oriented scheduling problem that aims to improve model quality and guarantee fairness. We propose a heuristic algorithm to divide the pool into several subsets such that the federated dataset in a subset is close to an independent and identical distribution (iid) while guaranteeing each client is selected at least once in a scheduling period. In addition, we propose a performance-based payment adjustment protocol with a bonus and punishment mechanism, such that the final payment reflects the actual performance of each selected client. Our fairness analysis and experimental results show that our scheme not only can guarantee fairness but also can improve the model quality especially when data are non-iid.

AB Elevated levels of ammonia in breath can be linked to medical complications, such as chronic kidney disease (CKD), that disturb the urea balance in the body. However, early stage CKD is usually asymptomatic, and mass screening is hindered by high instrumentation and operation requirements and accessible and reliable detection methods for CKD biomarkers, such as trace ammonia in breath. Enabling methods would have significance in population screening for early stage CKD patients. We herein report a method to effectively immobilize transition metal selectors in close proximity to a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) surface using pentiptycene polymers containing metal-chelating backbone structures. The robust and modular nature of the pentiptycene metallopolymer/SWCNT complexes creates a platform that accelerates sensor discovery and optimization. Using these methods, we have identified sensitive, selective, and robust copper-based chemiresistive ammonia sensors that display low parts per billion detection limits. We have added these hybrid materials to the resonant radio frequency circuits of commercial near-field communication (NFC) tags to achieve robust wireless detection of ammonia at physiologically relevant levels. The integrated devices offer a noninvasive and cost-effective approach for early detection and monitoring of CKD.

TI Electron Scattering at Ru-TiN-Ru Interface Stacks
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRON DEVICES

DT Article

ID RESISTIVITY; COPPER
AB Electron transport across Ru-TiN-Ru interfaces is quantified using multilayers containing five 10-nm-thick Ru(0001) layers separated by TiN interlayers with nominal thicknesses dTiN ranging from 0.01 to 1.6 nm. The multilayers are deposited by sputtering on Al2O3(0001) substrates at 700 degree celsius. Their resistivity parallel to the interfaces increases linearly from rho = 7.8 - 11.2 mu Omega-cm with increasing d(TiN) = 0-0.2 nm and saturates at a constant rho = 13.3 +/- 2.5 mu Omega -cm for d(TiN) >= 0.4 nm. The linear increase is attributed to electron impurity scattering at a discontinuous TiN layer while resistivity saturation is associated with parallel conduction in individual Ru layers without coherent transport between Ru layers. The data indicate a critical d(TiN) = 0.4-0.6 nm above which electron transport across Ru-TiN-Ru is completely diffuse, leading to a Ru-TiN-Ru contact resistance that is proportional to the TiN layer thickness. This critical thickness is in good agreement with the onset d(TiN) = 0.4-0.6 nm of a decrease in the out-of-plane X-ray coherence length, the onset at d(TiN) = 0.4 nm of a detectable X-ray diffraction (XRD) superlattice peak, and the development of X-ray reflectivity (XRR) superlattice fringes for d(TiN) >= 0.4 nm.

AB Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are secreted by almost all cell types and contain DNA, RNA, proteins, lipids and other metabolites. EVs were initially believed to be cellular waste but now recognized for their role in cell-to-cell communication. Later, EVs from immune cells were discovered to function similarly to their parent cells, paving the way for their use as gene and drug carriers. EVs from different cell types or biological fluids carry distinct cargo depending on their origin, and they perform diverse functions. For instance, EVs derived from stem cells possess pluripotent properties, reflecting the cargo from their parent cells. Over the past two decades, substantial preclinical and clinical research has explored EVs-mediated drug and gene delivery to various organs, including the brain. Natural or intrinsic EVs may be effective for certain applications, but as drug or gene carriers, they demonstrate broader and more efficient potential across various diseases. Here, we review research on using EVs to treat central nervous system (CNS) diseases, such as Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson diseases, depression, anxiety, dementia, and acute ischemic strokes. We first reviewed the na & iuml;ve EVs, especially mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) derived EVs in CNS diseases and summarized the clinical trials of EVs in treating CNS diseases and highlighted the reports of two complete trials. Then, we overviewed the preclinical research of EVs as drug and gene delivery vehicles in CNS disease models, including the most recent two years' progress and discussed the mechanisms and new methods of engineered EVs for targeting CNS. Finally, we discussed challenges and future directions and of EVs as personalized medicine for CNS diseases.

AB The Bay of Bengal (BoB) is a 2,600,000 km(2) expanse in the Indian Ocean upon which many humans rely. However, the primary producers underpinning food chains here remain poorly characterized. We examined phytoplankton abundance and diversity along strong BoB latitudinal and vertical salinity gradients-which have low temperature variation (27-29 degrees C) between the surface and subsurface chlorophyll maximum (SCM). In surface waters, Prochlorococcus averaged 11.7 +/- 4.4 x 104 cells ml(-1), predominantly HLII, whereas LLII and 'rare' ecotypes, HLVI and LLVII, dominated in the SCM. Synechococcus averaged 8.4 +/- 2.3 x 10(4) cells ml(-1) in the surface, declined rapidly with depth, and population structure of dominant Clade II differed between surface and SCM; Clade X was notable at both depths. Across all sites, Ostreococcus Clade OII dominated SCM eukaryotes whereas communities differentiated strongly moving from Arabian Sea-influenced high salinity (southerly; prasinophytes) to freshwater-influenced low salinity (northerly; stramenopiles, specifically, diatoms, pelagophytes, and dictyochophytes, plus the prasinophyte Micromonas) surface waters. Eukaryotic phytoplankton peaked in the south (1.9 x 10(4) cells ml(-1), surface) where a novel Ostreococcus was revealed, named here Ostreococcus bengalensis. We expose dominance of a single picoeukaryote and hitherto 'rare' picocyanobacteria at depth in this complex ecosystem where studies suggest picoplankton are replacing larger phytoplankton due to climate change.

AB Polysiloxane is one of the most important polymeric materials in technological use. Polydimethylsiloxane displays glass-like mechanical properties at low temperatures. Incorporation of phenyl siloxane, via copolymerization for example, improves not only the low-temperature elasticity but also enhances its performance over a wide range of temperatures. Copolymerization with the phenyl component can significantly change the microscopic properties of polysiloxanes, such as chain dynamics and relaxation. However, despite much work in the literature, the influence of such changes is still not clearly understood. In this work, we systematically study the structure and dynamics of random poly(dimethyl-co-diphenyl)siloxane via atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. As the molar ratio phi of the diphenyl component increases, we find that the size of the linear copolymer chain expands. At the same time, the chain-diffusivity slows down by over an order of magnitudes. The reduced diffusivity appears to be a result of a complex interplay between the structural and dynamic changes induced by phenyl substitution.

AB We study the boundedness of Littlewood-Paley-Stein square functions associated to multilinear operators. We prove weighted Lebesgue space bounds for square functions under relaxed regularity and cancellation conditions that are independent of weights, which is a new result even in the linear case. For a class of multilinear convolution operators, we prove necessary and sufficient conditions for weighted Lebesgue space bounds. Using extrapolation theory, we extend weighted bounds in the multilinear setting for Lebesgue spaces with index smaller than one.

AB Monotonicity testing of Boolean functions on the hypergrid, f : [n](d) -> {0, 1}, is a classic topic in property testing. Determining the non-adaptive complexity of this problem is an important open question. For arbitrary n, [Black-Chakrabarty-Seshadhri, SODA 2020] describe a tester with query complexity (O) over tilde(epsilon(-4/3) d(5/6)). This complexity is independent of n, but has a suboptimal dependence on d. Recently, [Braverman-Khot-Kindler-Minzer, ITCS 2023] and [Black-Chakrabarty-Seshadhri, STOC 2023] describe (O) over tilde(epsilon(-2) n(3) root d) and (O) over tilde(epsilon(-2) n root d)-query testers, respectively. These testers have an almost optimal dependence on d, but a suboptimal polynomial dependence on n.
   In this paper, we describe a non-adaptive, one-sided monotonicity tester with query complexity O(epsilon(-2) d(1/2+o(1))), independent of n. Up to the d(o(1))-factors, our result resolves the non-adaptive complexity of monotonicity testing for Boolean functions on hypergrids. The independence of n yields a non-adaptive, one-sided O(epsilon(-2) d(1/2+o(1)))-query monotonicity tester for Boolean functions f : R-d -> {0, 1} associated with an arbitrary product measure.

AB Deoxydehydration (DODH) is a transformation that converts a vicinal diol into an olefin with the help of a sacrificial reductant. The reaction has drawn interest in the past 25 years for its potential to upgrade polyols from biomass to chemicals or fuels. This minireview is organized in 7 sections, and, while providing a comprehensive survey of the literature in tabular form, focuses on aspects that are not extensively discussed in prior reviews. The first three brief sections consist of an introduction to DODH, followed by an overview of present research thrusts and a listing of prior reviews and the patent literature. The fourth section addresses reaction thermodynamics. The fifth section provides a survey of catalysts investigated for DODH, most of which are rhenium, molybdenum, and vanadium compounds. These catalysts have been used in heterogeneous and homogenous catalysis alike. The catalyst compositions are discussed including the effect of counterions that are not part of the active metal moiety. The sixth section reviews rate laws that have been formulated and the steps identified as rate controlling, by experiment or theory. Catalyst reduction and olefin extrusion emerge as key steps. In this context, the somewhat mysterious trends among alcohol reductants are inspected. It emerges that the DODH field would benefit from benchmark reactions that will quantitatively connect the collected catalytic data. The seventh section considers phase chemistry, separations, and energy input.

AB Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks have been a significant challenge, presenting a substantial threat to the stability and security of the Internet. Detecting and mitigating DDoS attacks effectively remains challenging due to their unique characteristics. Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) technologies have been introduced to develop efficient Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) for detecting and preventing DDoS attacks. In this study, three distinct machine learning algorithms, namely Random Forest (RF), Naive Bayes (NB), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), were used to construct an IDS for identifying TCP-SYN based DDoS attack using the CIC-DDoS 2019 dataset. For this study, we employed a dataset comprising 200,000 samples of TCP-SYN attack data to assess the effectiveness of machine learning models in constructing an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). However, we found that this dataset was imbalanced which could impact the overall performance. To tackle the imbalance problem, four different techniques, namely SMOTE, ADASYN, SMOTE + Tomek Link, and SMOTE + ENN, were utilized, and their performances were evaluated. Subsequently, the performance of three ML models was assessed using metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, balanced accuracy, and AUC score under four different balancing techniques. In this paper, we conducted simulations to compare the performance of these ML models with different balancing techniques.

AB Sparse tensor decomposition and completion are common in numerous applications, ranging from machine learning to computational quantum chemistry. Typically, the main bottleneck in optimization of these models are contractions of a single large sparse tensor with a network of several dense matrices or tensors (SpTTN). Prior works on high-performance tensor decomposition and completion have focused on performance and scalability optimizations for specific SpTTN kernels. We present algorithms and a runtime system for identifying and executing the most efficient loop nest for any SpTTN kernel. We consider both enumeration of such loop nests for autotuning and efficient algorithms for finding the lowest cost loop nest for simpler metrics, such as buffer size or cache miss models. Our runtime system identifies the best choice of loop nest without user guidance, and also provides a distributed-memory parallelization of SpTTN kernels. We evaluate our framework using both real-world and synthetic tensors. Our results demonstrate that our approach outperforms available generalized state-of-the-art libraries and matches the performance of specialized codes.

AB In recent years, significant attention in deep learning theory has been devoted to analyzing when models that interpolate their training data can still generalize well to unseen examples. Many insights have been gained from studying models with multiple layers of Gaussian random features, for which one can compute precise generalization asymptotics. However, few works have considered the effect of weight anisotropy; most assume that the random features are generated using independent and identically distributed Gaussian weights, and allow only for structure in the input data. Here, we use the replica trick from statistical physics to derive learning curves for models with many layers of structured Gaussian features. We show that allowing correlations between the rows of the first layer of features can aid generalization, while structure in later layers is generally detrimental. Our results shed light on how weight structure affects generalization in a simple class of solvable models.

TI Semblans: automated assembly and processing of RNA-seq data
SO BIOINFORMATICS
LA English
DT Article
ID INFERENCE
AB Motivation Recent advancements in parallel sequencing methods have precipitated a surge in publicly available short-read sequence data. This has encouraged the development of novel computational tools for the de novo assembly of transcriptomes from RNA-seq data. Despite the availability of these tools, performing an end-to-end transcriptome assembly remains a programmatically involved task necessitating familiarity with best practices. Aside from quality control steps, including error correction, adapter trimming, and chimera filtration needing to be correctly used, moving data between programs often requires manual reformatting or restructuring, which can further impede throughput. Here, we introduce Semblans, a tool for streamlining the assembly process that efficiently and consistently produces high-quality transcriptome assemblies.Results Semblans abstracts the key quality control, reconstitution, and postprocessing steps of transcriptome assembly from raw short-read sequences to annotated coding sequences. Evaluating its performance against previously assembled transcriptomes on the basis of assembly quality, we find that Semblans produced higher quality assemblies for 98 of the 101 short-read runs tested.Availability and implementation Semblans is written in C++ and runs on Unix-compliant operating systems.

AB Federated learning is a popular distributed learning approach for training a machine learning model without disclosing raw data. It consists of a parameter server and a possibly large collection of clients (e.g., in cross-device federated learning) that may operate in congested and changing environments. In this paper, we study federated learning in the presence of stochastic and dynamic communication failures wherein the uplink between the parameter server and client i is on with unknown probability p(i)(t) in round t. Furthermore, we allow the dynamics of p(i)(t) to be arbitrary. We first demonstrate that when the p(i)(t)'s vary across clients, the most widely adopted federated learning algorithm, Federated Average (FedAvg), experiences significant bias. To address this observation, we propose Federated Postponed Broadcast (FedPBC), a simple variant of FedAvg. It differs from FedAvg in that the parameter server postpones broadcasting the global model to the clients with active uplinks till the end of each training round. Despite uplink failures, we show that FedPBC converges to a stationary point of the original non-convex objective. On the technical front, postponing the global model broadcasts enables implicit gossiping among the clients with active links in round t. In spite of the time-varying nature of pti, we can bound the perturbation of the global model dynamics using techniques to control gossip-type information mixing errors. Extensive experiments have been conducted on real-world datasets over diversified unreliable uplink patterns to corroborate our analysis.

AB We perform a numerical bootstrap study of scalar operators in the critical 3d Gross-Neveu-Yukawa models, a family of conformal field theories containing N Majorana fermions in the fundamental representation of an O(N) global symmetry. We compute rigorous bounds on the scaling dimensions of the next-to-lowest parity-even and parity-odd singlet scalars at N = 2, 4, and 8. All of these dimensions have lower bounds greater than 3, implying that there are only two relevant singlet scalars and placing constraints on the RG flow structure of these theories.

AB External flows past automotive bodies exhibit separation bubbles and trailing longitudinal vortices. This paper assesses the ability of wall-modeled large eddy simulation (WMLES) to accurately predict the main flow features of automotive aerodynamic flows by investigating the flow past an Ahmed body with a 25 degrees slant angle and a Reynolds number of 2.78 x 10(6). The wallshear stress is modeled with the algebraic power-law model by Werner and Wengle (Turbulent Shear Flows, vol 8, pp 155-168, 1993). Simulations are performed with the open source finite volume code OpenFOAM using the PISO algorithm. Wall modeling is implemented in OpenFOAM using a third-party WMLES library, libWallModelledLES. Four wall-normal grid spacings are investigated, while the wall-model sampling height remains fixed. Results demonstrate that WMLES captures the general wake behavior by predicting the pair of counter-rotating separation bubbles behind the Ahmed body and WMLES accurately predicts the formation of the longitudinal counter-rotating vortex pair that is shed from the starting edge of the slanted face.

DT Article
AB Background: Single cell mass spectrometry (scMS) has shown great promise for label free proteomics analysis recently. To present single cell samples for proteomics analysis by MS is not a trivial task. Existing methods rely on robotic liquid handlers to scale up sample preparation throughput. The cost associated with specialized equipment hinders the broad adoption of these workflows, and the sequential sample processing nature limits the ultimate throughput. Results: In this work, we report a parallel sample processing workflow that can simultaneously process 10 single cells without the need of robotic liquid handlers for scMS. This method utilized 3D printed microfluidic devices to form reagent arrays on a glass slide, and a magnetic beads-based streamlined sample processing workflow to present peptides for LC-MS detection. We optimized key operational parameters of the method and demonstrated the quantification consistency among 10 parallel processed samples. Finally, the utility of the method in differentiating cell lines and studying the proteome change induced by drug treatment were demonstrated. Significance: The present method allows parallel sample processing for single cells without the need of expensive liquid handlers, which has great potential to further improve throughput and decrease the barrier for single cell proteomics.

TI Binding Site Programmable Self-Assembly of 3D Hierarchical DNA Origami
   Nanostructures
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A
LA English
DT Article
ID ENVIRONMENTAL INTERFACES; PHYSICAL-CHEMISTRY; BIOTIN; ANALOGS; ENERGY
AB DNA nanotechnology has broad applications in biomedical drug delivery and programmable materials. Characterization of the self-assembly of DNA origami and quantum dots (QDs) is necessary for the development of new DNA-based nanostructures. We use computation and experiment to show that the self-assembly of 3D hierarchical nanostructures can be controlled by programming the binding site number and their positions on DNA origami. Using biotinylated pentagonal pyramid wireframe DNA origamis and streptavidin capped QDs, we demonstrate that DNA origami with 1 binding site at the outer vertex can assemble multimeric origamis with up to 6 DNA origamis on 1 QD, and DNA origami with 1 binding site at the inner center can only assemble monomeric and dimeric origamis. Meanwhile, the yield percentages of different multimeric origamis are controlled by the QD:DNA-origami stoichiometric mixing ratio. DNA origamis with 2 binding sites at the alpha gamma positions (of the pentagon) make larger nanostructures than those with binding sites at the alpha beta positions. In general, increasing the number of binding sites leads to increases in the nanostructure size. At high DNA origami concentration, the QD number in each cluster becomes the limiting factor for the growth of nanostructures. We find that reducing the QD size can also affect the self-assembly because of the reduced access to the binding sites from more densely packed origamis.

AB Concept-based interpretability methods aim to explain a deep neural network model's components and predictions using a pre-defined set of semantic concepts. These methods evaluate a trained model on a new, "probe" dataset and correlate the model's outputs with concepts labeled in that dataset. Despite their popularity, they suffer from limitations that are not well-understood and articulated in the literature. In this work, we identify and analyze three commonly overlooked factors in concept-based explanations. First, we find that the choice of the probe dataset has a profound impact on the generated explanations. Our analysis reveals that different probe datasets lead to very different explanations, suggesting that the generated explanations are not generalizable outside the probe dataset. Second, we find that concepts in the probe dataset are often harder to learn than the target classes they are used to explain, calling into question the correctness of the explanations. We argue that only easily learnable concepts should be used in concept-based explanations. Finally, while existing methods use hundreds or even thousands of concepts, our human studies reveal a much stricter upper bound of 32 concepts or less, beyond which the explanations are much less practically useful. We discuss the implications of our findings and provide suggestions for future development of concept-based interpretability methods.

AB This work aims to serve as a comprehensive guide to properly characterize solid-contact ion-selective electrodes (SC-ISEs) for long-term use as they advance toward calibration-free sensors. The lack of well-defined SC-ISE performance criteria limits the ability to compare results and track progress in the field. Laser-induced graphene (LIG) is a rapid and scalable method that, by adjusting the CO2 laser parameters, can create LIG substrates with tunable surface properties, including wettability, surface chemistry, and morphology. Herein, we fabricate laser-induced graphene (LIG) solid-contact electrodes using different laser settings and subsequently convert them into ion-selective sensors using a potassium-selective membrane. We measure the aforementioned tunable surface properties and correlate them with resultant low-frequency capacitance and water layer formation in an effort to pinpoint their effects on the sensitivity (Nernstian response), reproducibility (E degrees' variation), and potential stability of the LIG-based SC-ISEs. More specifically, we demonstrate that the surface wettability of the LIG substrate, which can be tuned by controlling the lasing parameters, can be modified to exhibit hydrophobic (contact angle > 90 degrees) and even highly hydrophobic surfaces (contact angle approximate to 130 degrees) to help reduce sensor drift. Recommendations are also provided to ensure proper and robust characterization of SC-ISEs for long-term and continuous measurements. Ultimately, we believe that a comprehensive understanding of the correlation between LIG tunable surface properties and SC-ISE performance can be used to improve the electrochemical behavior and stability of SC-ISEs designed with a wide range of materials beyond LIG.

AB Stretchable and free-form displays receive significant attention as they hold immense potential for revolutionizing future display technologies. These displays are designed to conform to irregular surfaces and endure mechanical strains, making them well suited for applications in wearable electronics, biomedical devices, and interactive displays. Traditional light-emitting devices typically employ brittle inorganic and metallic materials, which are not conducive to stretchability. However, replacing these nonflexible components with flexible/stretchable nanomaterials, soft organic materials, or their composites improves the overall flexibility and stretchability of devices. In this review, the roles and opportunities of nanomaterials, such as thin films, 1D nanofibrous materials, and micro/nanoparticles, are highlighted for enhancing the stretchability and overall performance of various types of light-emitting devices. By leveraging the unique mechanical and electrical properties of nanomaterials, various efforts emerge to push the boundaries of stretchable display technologies and further realize their full potential for diverse applications.
   The roles and opportunities of nanomaterials in enhancing the stretchability and overall performance of stretchable light-emitting devices are discussed. Various nanomaterials utilized in intrinsically stretchable displays are comprehensively reviewed. Different structural strategies employed in stretchable displays and the role of nanomaterials within these devices are also presented.image (c) 2024 WILEY-VCH GmbH

AB Post deposition thermal annealing of amorphous coatings improves optical properties of dielectric mirrors. However, excessive temperatures cause crystallization, resulting in a degradation of mechanical and optical properties. Therefore, annealing is limited to temperatures 'below' the crystallization threshold. The threshold is determined by x-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement which requires a significant amount of crystallized material for detection, yet it has been shown that a population of crystallites may exist in otherwise amorphous coatings below the threshold temperature. In this study XRD measurements show crystallites that grow during annealing within amorphous oxide coatings to a limited and predictable size predicated on the difference in density between the crystal and the surrounding amorphous phase and the average material's Young's modulus. These crystallites may be the point-like, extremely weak scatterers revealed in the LIGO test masses when imaged off-axis.

AB This paper considers the change point detection problem under dependent samples. In particular, we provide performance guarantees for the MMD-CUSUM test under exponentially alpha, beta, and fast phi-mixing processes, which significantly expands its utility beyond the i.i.d. and Markovian cases used in previous studies. We obtain lower bounds for average-run-length (ARL) and upper bounds for average-detection-delay (ADD) in terms of the threshold parameter. We show that the MMD-CUSUM test enjoys the same level of performance as the i.i.d. case under fast phi-mixing processes. The MMD-CUSUM test also achieves strong performance under exponentially alpha/beta-mixing processes, which are significantly more relaxed than existing results. The MMD-CUSUM test statistic adapts to different settings without modifications, rendering it a completely data-driven, dependence-agnostic change point detection scheme. Numerical simulations are provided at the end to evaluate our findings.

AB Through test particle simulations based on solar wind observations by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) mission, we demonstrate that a magnetic gradient can significantly enhance the efficiency of scattering and energization of the strahl electrons by quasi-parallel whistlers, through the phase trapping effect due to the gyrosurfing mechanism. We identify quasi-linear and nonlinear regimes of these interactions for different combinations of wave amplitude (B w /B 0) and the strength of the magnetic field gradient with magnetic field depletion level (B h /B 0) as a proxy. Nonlinear effects are observed for B w /B 0 greater than or similar to 10-3 and B h /B 0 greater than or similar to 0.1. We estimated the extending of the resonant energy range due to the wave and the magnetic field gradient interplay and demonstrated that these mechanisms result in the broadening of the strahl electron pitch-angle distribution typically observed in situ. The combination of parallel whistlers collocated with a magnetic gradient is frequently observed by PSP in magnetic dips at the edges of magnetic switchbacks. Our results indicate that these mechanisms may be highly relevant for pitch-angle scattering of the strahl electrons and regulating the heat flux near the Sun at heliocentric distances of 30-45 R S . Specifically, core and halo electrons may experience a 10% increase in their initial energy, and the majority of strahl electrons may be scattered (by an average of 30 degrees) into the hot and trapped plasma inside magnetic dips.

Single-cell population genomics provides increased detection resolution when mapping variants that control molecular traits, including gene expression or chromatin accessibility. Additionally, single-cell population genomics reveals the cell types in which variants act and, when combined with organism-level phenotype measurements, unveils which cellular contexts impact higher-order traits. Emerging technologies, notably multiomics, can facilitate the measurement of both genetic changes and genomic traits in single cells, enabling single-cell genetic experiments. The implementation of single-cell genetics will advance the investigation of the genetic architecture of complex molecular traits and provide new experimental paradigms to study eukaryotic genetics.

AB The efficient and timely optimization of microarchitecture for a target application is hindered by the long evaluation runtime of a design candidate, creating a serious burden. To tackle this problem, researchers have started using learning algorithms such as graph neural networks (GNNs) to accelerate the process by developing a surrogate of the target tool. However, challenges arise when developing such models for HLS tools due to the program's long dependency range and deeply coupled input program and transformations (i.e., pragmas). To address them, in this paper, we present HARP (Hierarchical Augmentation for Representation with Pragma optimization) with a novel hierarchical graph representation of the HLS design by introducing auxiliary nodes to include high-level hierarchical information about the design. Additionally, HARP decouples the representation of the program and its transformations and includes a neural pragma transformer (NPT) approach to facilitate a more systematic treatment of this process. Our proposed graph representation and model architecture of HARP not only enhance the performance of the model and design space exploration based on it but also improve the model's transfer learning capability, enabling easier adaptation to new environments(1).

TI Modeling allosteric mechanisms of eukaryotic type II topoisomerases
SO BIOPHYSICAL JOURNAL

AB Type II topoisomerases (TopoIIs) are ubiquitous enzymes that are involved in crucial nuclear processes such as genome organization, chromosome segregation, and other DNA metabolic processes. These enzymes function as large, homodimeric complexes that undergo a complex cycle of binding and hydrolysis of two ATP molecules in their ATPase domains, which regulates the capture and passage of one DNA double-helix through a second, cleaved DNA molecule. This process requires the transmission of information about the state of the bound nucleotide over vast ranges in the TopoII complex. How this information is transmitted at the molecular level to regulate TopoII functions and how protein substitutions disrupt these mechanisms remains largely unknown. Here, we employed extensive microsecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations of the yeast TopoII enzyme in multiple nucleotide-bound states and with amino acid substitutions near both the N and C termini of the complex. Simulation results indicate that the ATPase domains are remarkably flexible on the sub-microsecond timescale and that these dynamics are modulated by the identity of the bound nucleotides and both local and distant amino acid substitutions. Network analyses point toward specific allosteric networks that transmit information about the hydrolysis cycle throughout the complex, which include residues in both the protein and the bound DNA molecule. Amino acid substitutions weaken many of these pathways. Together, our results provide molecular level details on how the TopoII catalytic cycle is controlled through nucleotide binding and hydrolysis and how mutations may disrupt this process. SIGNIFICANCE Type II topoisomerases (TopoIIs) are essential and ubiquitous for maintaining DNA topology in the nucleus. The mechanisms by which information about the nucleotide-binding state is transmitted from the ATPase domains throughout the TopoII complex remain poorly understood. We used microsecond-timescale molecular dynamics simulations to probe the allosteric mechanisms underlying TopoII function. Results indicate remarkable flexibility of the ATPase domains on this timescale, which is modulated by nucleotide binding and local and distant amino acid substitutions. Furthermore, we mapped the allosteric networks linking the ATPase and DNA-cleavage domains and connected them to the ATPase domain dynamics. Our findings provide molecular level insights into how nucleotide binding and hydrolysis regulate the TopoII catalytic cycle and how mutations can disrupt these processes.

AB Children's ethnicity-status associations are often studied in societies where one ethnic group possesses status across multiple dimensions, such as political influence and wealth. This study examined children's (6-12 years) and adults' representations of more complex hierarchies in Indonesia (N = 341; 38% Native Indonesian, 33% Chinese Indonesian, and 27% other ethnicities; 55% female, 36% male; 2021-2022), a society where ethnic groups hold distinct forms of status (on average, Native Indonesians have political influence; Chinese Indonesians have wealth). By 6.5 years, children associated Native Indonesians with political influence and Chinese Indonesians with wealth. Intersectional analyses indicated that ethnicity-status associations were stronger for male than female targets. Children of all ethnicities preferred Chinese Indonesians and preferences were predicted by wealth judgments.

ID COMPRESSION
AB This paper aims to enhance the computational efficiency of safety verification of neural network control systems by developing a guaranteed neural network model reduction method. First, a concept of model reduction precision is proposed to describe the guaranteed distance between the outputs of a neural network and its reduced-size version. A reachability-based algorithm is proposed to accurately compute the model reduction precision. Then, by substituting a reduced-size neural network controller into the closed-loop system, an algorithm to compute the reachable set of the original system is developed, which is able to support much more computationally efficient safety verification processes. Finally, the developed methods are applied to a case study of the Adaptive Cruise Control system with a neural network controller, which is shown to significantly reduce the computational time of safety verification and thus validate the effectiveness of the method.

AB Most species can be coinfected by multiple pathogens that may interact through shared resources (i.e., resource competition) or the host immune system (i.e., apparent competition). Community theory developed for free-living organisms suggests that coinfecting pathogens can persist if they satisfy the mutual invasion criterion of coexistence, establishing infections in hosts that are already infected. Furthermore, the likelihood of coexistence may depend on host nutrition which can affect shared resources and host immunity. Here, we apply the novel approach of combining a dynamical model and experimental mutual invasibility trials to explore the effects of host nutrient supply on the coexistence of two viral plant pathogens. We focus on among-pathogen interactions mediated by shared resources. First, we used a model to generate hypotheses about how nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) supply rates affect the ability of two plant viruses to invade established infections of the other virus. Then, we experimentally manipulated the N and P supplied to oats (Avena sativa) in a growth chamber experiment and tested mutual invasion of two RNA viral pathogens, BYDV-PAV and CYDV-RPV. Nutrient supplies ranged from rates that barely kept hosts alive up to high, but sub-toxic, rates. Model simulations suggested that the viruses were more likely to invade established infections either when they could replicate at lower N and P concentrations or when plant N and P concentrations increased due to a combination of nutrient supply rates and resident virus nutrient use. In the experiment, each virus successfully invaded hosts infected by the other and had consistent growth rates across N and P supply rates. Our results suggest that BYDV-PAV and CYDV-RPV can coexist across a wide range environmental nutrient supply, which is consistent with the high levels of co-occurrence of these two viruses in field populations.

AB Genome editing with CRISPR RNA-guided endonucleases generates DNA breaks that are resolved by cellular DNA repair machinery. However, analogous methods to manipulate RNA remain unavailable. We show that site-specific RNA breaks generated with type-III CRISPR complexes are repaired in human cells and that this repair can be used for programmable deletions in human transcripts to restore gene function. Collectively, this work establishes a technology for precise RNA manipulation with potential therapeutic applications.

AB To offload the rapidly increasing video traffic in the Internet of Things (IoT), the caching and computing-enabled unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become a paradigm in alleviating the pressure of wireless backhauls of the mobile network operator (MNO) and improving the Quality of Service (QoS) of subscribers of content providers (CPs), especially, in the situations where fixedly deployed small-cell base stations (SBSs) are not applicable. However, the resources in the UAV are costly and limited, while rational CPs are reluctant to reveal their willingness of leasing. Taking such asymmetric information into consideration, the problem that how the MNO leases the caching and computing resources to different CPs is formulated into a contract design problem, in which the UAV's 3-D position deployment is also involved. To find the optimal solutions, the proposed problem is decoupled into two subproblems. In the position deployment subproblem, the 3-D position of the UAV is analyzed, and the hovering height and coverage radius are jointly optimized to maximize the offloading volume during the life of the UAV. With the derived optimal position of the UAV, the individual rationality (IR) and incentive compatibility (IC) constraints in the contract design subproblem are simplified, and a low complexity algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs) is proposed to find the optimal contract. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified by simulation, and a comparative analysis is carried out in terms of save latency, saved bandwidth and utility.

AB Bacterial phage shock protein (PSP) systems stabilize the bacterial cell membrane and protect against envelope stress. These systems have been associated with virulence, but despite their critical roles, PSP components are not well characterized outside proteobacteria. Using comparative genomics and protein sequence-structure-function analyses, we systematically identified and analyzed PSP homologs, phyletic patterns, domain architectures, and gene neighborhoods. This approach underscored the evolutionary significance of the system, revealing that its core protein PspA (Snf7 in ESCRT outside bacteria) was present in the last universal common ancestor and that this ancestral functionality has since diversified into multiple novel, distinct PSP systems across life. Several novel partners of the PSP system were identified: (i) the Toastrack domain, likely facilitating assembly of sub-membrane stress-sensing and signaling complexes, (ii) the newly defined HTH-associated alpha-helical signaling domain-PadR-like transcriptional regulator pair system, and (iii) multiple independent associations with ATPase, CesT/Tir-like chaperone, and Band-7 domains in proteins thought to mediate sub-membrane dynamics. Our work also uncovered links between the PSP components and other domains, such as novel variants of SHOCT-like domains, suggesting roles in assembling membrane-associated complexes of proteins with disparate biochemical functions. Results are available at our interactive web app, https://jravilab.org/psp. IMPORTANCE Phage shock proteins (PSP) are virulence-associated, cell membrane stress-protective systems. They have mostly been characterized in Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. We now show that a minimal PSP system was present in the last universal common ancestor that evolved and diversified into newly identified functional contexts. Recognizing the conservation and evolution of PSP systems across bacterial phyla contributes to our understanding of stress response mechanisms in prokaryotes. Moreover, the newly discovered PSP modularity will likely prompt new studies of lineage-specific cell envelope structures, lifestyles, and adaptation mechanisms. Finally, our results validate the use of domain architecture and genetic context for discovery in comparative genomics.

AB In this paper, we examine the cleavage fracture anisotropy in tantalum carbides, namely, TaC, alpha-Ta2C, and zeta-Ta4C3 - x, using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our investigation identifies the presence of multiple low-energy cleavage planes indicating multiple potential pathways for crack propagation in these ceramics, even the low symmetry compounds. The anisotropy characteristics of cleavage fractures exhibited by alpha-Ta2C and zeta-Ta4C3 - x closely align with the intrinsic fracture anisotropy observed in TaC. Notably, there exist at least three pyramidal planes in zeta-Ta4C3 - x whose cleavage energies are less than those of the carbon-depleted basal planes, previously reported to have the lowest cleavage energy. The observed preference in experiments for cleavage along carbon-depleted basal planes, exclusive of other identified low-energy planes, points to factors beyond cleavage energy influencing cleavage plane preference.
   The anisotropy of cleavage fracture in tantalum carbide compounds was investigated using density functional theory to understand the high fracture toughness of the zeta phase. Surprisingly, these compounds exhibit a large number of low-energy cleavage planes indicating a tendency for fracture isotropy, suggesting that localized plastic deformation plays a crucial role in determining the preferred paths of cleavage fracture. image

AB Seed dispersal, or the movement of diaspores away from the parent location, is a multiscale, multipartner process that depends on the interaction of plant life history with vector movement and the environment. Seed dispersal underpins many important plant ecological and evolutionary processes such as gene flow, population dynamics, range expansion, and diversity.We review exciting new directions that the field of seed dispersal ecology and evolution has taken over the past 40 years. We provide an overview of the ultimate causes of dispersal and the consequences of this important process for plant population and community dynamics.We also discuss several emergent unifying frameworks that are being used to study dispersal and describe how they can be integrated to provide a more mechanistic understanding of dispersal.

ID SHORTEST PATHS; UPDATE; SET
AB The edit distance is a fundamental measure of sequence similarity, defined as the minimum number of character insertions, deletions, and substitutions needed to transform one string into the other. Given two strings of length at most n, a simple dynamic programming computes their edit distance exactly in O(n(2)) time, which is also the best possible (up to subpolynomial factors) assuming the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). The last few decades have seen tremendous progress in edit distance approximation, where the runtime has been brought down to subquadratic, to near-linear, and even to sublinear at the cost of approximation.
   In this paper, we study the dynamic edit distance problem where the strings change dynamically as the characters are substituted, inserted, or deleted over time. Each change may happen at any location of either of the two strings. The goal is to maintain the (exact or approximate) edit distance of such dynamic strings while minimizing the update time. The exact edit distance can be maintained in O(n log(2) n) time per update (Charalampopoulos, Kociumaka, Mozes; 2020), which is again tight assuming SETH. Unfortunately, even with the unprecedented progress in edit distance approximation in the static setting, strikingly little is known regarding dynamic edit distance approximation. Utilizing the best near-linear-time (Andoni, Nosatzki; 2020) and sublinear-time (Goldenberg, Kociumaka, Krauthgamer, Saha; 2022) approximation algorithm, an old exact algorithm (Landau and Vishkin; 1988), and a generic dynamic strings implementation (Mehlhorn, Sundar, Uhrig; 1996), it is possible to achieve an O(n(c))-approximation in n(0.5-c+o(1)) update time for any constant c is an element of [0, 1/6]. Improving upon this trade-off, characterized by the approximation-ratio and update-time product n(0.5+o(1)), remains wide open.
   The contribution of this work is a dynamic n(o(1))-approximation algorithm with amortized expected update time of n(o(1)). In other words, we bring the approximation-ratio and update-time product down to n(o(1)), which is also the best possible with the current state of the art in static algorithms. Our solution utilizes an elegant framework of precision sampling trees for edit distance approximation (Andoni, Krauthgamer, Onak; 2010). We show how to dynamically maintain precision sampling trees, which comes with significant nontriviality and can be an independent tool of interest for further development in dynamic string algorithms.

AB In this paper, a data-driven neural hybrid system modeling framework via the Maximum Entropy partitioning approach is proposed for complex dynamical system modeling such as human motion dynamics. The sampled data collected from the system is partitioned into segmented data sets using the Maximum Entropy approach, and the mode transition logic is then defined. Then, as the local dynamical description for their corresponding partitions, a collection of small-scale neural networks is trained. Following a neural hybrid system model of the system, a set-valued reachability analysis with low computation cost is provided based on interval analysis and a split and combined process to demonstrate the benefits of our approach in computationally expensive tasks. Finally, a numerical examples of the limit cycle and a human behavior modeling example are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the developed methods.

AB In recent years, significant attention in deep learning theory has been devoted to analyzing when models that interpolate their training data can still generalize well to unseen examples. Many insights have been gained from studying models with multiple layers of Gaussian random features, for which one can compute precise generalization asymptotics. However, few works have considered the effect of weight anisotropy; most assume that the random features are generated using independent and identically distributed Gaussian weights, and allow only for structure in the input data. Here, we use the replica trick from statistical physics to derive learning curves for models with many layers of structured Gaussian features. We show that allowing correlations between the rows of the first layer of features can aid generalization, while structure in later layers is generally detrimental. Our results shed light on how weight structure affects generalization in a simple class of solvable models.

AB As a class of semiconductor nanocrystals that exhibit high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) at tunable wavelengths, perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) are attractive candidates for optoelectronic and light-emitting devices. However, attempts to optimize PNC integration into such applications suffer from PNC instability and loss of PL over time. Here, we describe the impact of organic and polymeric N-oxides when used in conjunction with PNCs, whereby a significant increase in PNC quantum yield is observed in solution, and stable PL emission is obtained in polymeric nanocomposites. Specifically, when using aliphatic N-oxides in ligand exchange with CsPbBr3 PNCs in solution, a substantial boost in PNC brightness is observed (similar to 40% or more PLQY increase), followed by an alteration of the perovskite chemistry. When N-oxide substituents are positioned pendent to a poly(n-butyl methacrylate) backbone, the optically clear flexible nanocomposite films obtained have bright PL emission and maintain optical clarity for months. X-ray diffraction is useful for characterizing the PNC crystalline structure following exposure to aliphatic N-oxides, while electron microscopy (EM) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements of the PNC-polymer nanocomposites show this polymeric N-oxide platform to cleanly disperse PNCs in flexible polymer films.

AB Social interactions are influenced by rapid judgements about interaction partners that are assumed to contribute to various behavioral biases. While often negligible in a given instance, such biases can accumulate to contribute to persistent inequities between social groups. Here, we used event-related potentials (ERPs) to determine the extent to which early attention to racial category information during simulated interpersonal interactions contributes to race bias in financial decisions. Undergraduate participants (N = 67; 36 women, 31 men; all White/ Non-Hispanic) completed an economic decision-making task in which they decided how much money to invest in a series of male interaction partners (i.e., trustees) who varied in their apparent racial group memberships. Black male trustees received lower investments than White male trustees, replicating prior findings. Of greater interest, an ERP index of attention to trustees' faces predicted racial bias in investments, and was moderated by participants' internalized motivation to respond without prejudice (i.e., a difference score reflecting the extent to which participants' motivation reflected internal [e.g., personal egalitarian values] compared to external [e.g., concerns about social norms] reasons to respond without prejudice). Consistent with motivational models of prejudice control, greater early attention to a trustee's face led to more-biased lending among participants with lower internalized motivation but to less-biased lending among participants with higher internalized motivation. Findings demonstrate a crucial role for within-person variability in attention to race-related cues when interacting with others, along with between-person bias regulation motives, in determining whether attention to race will increase or decrease bias in financial lending.

AB This work studies the feasibility of using reinforcement learning for small body science operations subject to resource constraints. Two mission scenarios are considered. In the first scenario, a spacecraft autonomously maneuvers between waypoints about a small body while performing science activities, such as mapping and imaging, and periodically downlinking data and managing on-board resources like battery charge, data buffer storage, and fuel usage. In the second scenario, the spacecraft periodically performs navigation updates to improve its state estimate, ensuring that the collected science is within the specified requirements. A Markov decision process formulation of the mission scenarios is formulated, and reinforcement learning is applied to solve the problem. A range of noisy observation types are tested, demonstrating that a fully observable formulation of the problem trained on direct observations of the state is robust to noisy measurements or a filtered state estimate. A decision-making agent is then trained to manage the state estimate by choosing when to take measurements, demonstrating that near-equivalent policies, in comparison to nominal problem formulation, can be trained with an optional navigation update. Finally, a demonstration is performed in which a ground station outage is simulated. The decision-making agent is shown to be robust to this outage, rapidly adjusting its plan to continue nominal operations.

ID CONVERGENCE ANALYSIS; ALGORITHM
AB Quantum linear system algorithms (QLSAs) have the potential to speed up Interior Point Methods (IPMs). However, a major bottleneck is the inexactness of quantum tomography to extract classical solutions from quantum states. In addition, QLSAs are sensitive to the condition number, and this sensitivity is exacerbated when the Newton systems arising in IPMs converge to a singular matrix. Recently, an Inexact Feasible Quantum IPM (IF-QIPM) has been developed that addresses the inexactness of QLSAs. However, this method requires a large number of gates and qubits to be implemented. Here, we propose a new IF-QIPM using the normal equation system, which requires fewer gates and qubits. To mitigate the sensitivity to the condition number and other input data-related parameters, we use preconditioning coupled with iterative refinement to obtain better complexity. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on IBM Qiskit simulators.

AB R-410A is a near-azeotropic refrigerant mixture of difluoromethane (HFC-32) and pentafluoroethane (HFC-125) that is scheduled to be phased out internationally due to a high Global Warming Potential (GWP). While conventional distillation cannot be used, extractive distillation using ionic liquids (ILs) has been proposed to separate and recycle HFC-32 (lower GWP) for future refrigerant blends and to repurpose HFC-125 (high GWP). Here, we present both a thermodynamic and process design analyses of various ILs using an equation of state method. From experimental binary vapor-liquid equilibrium data and equation of state modeling, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tricyanomethanide [C(2)C(1)im][tcm] and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium dicyanamide [C(2)C(1)im][dca] were identified from 10 ILs as viable entrainers. Selectivity increases with temperature and decreases with pressure, while the solvent-to-feed (S/F) ratio did not have much effect. These effects were more pronounced for [C(2)C(1)im][tcm] than for [C(2)C(1)im][dca]. A sensitivity analysis reveals that the optimum operational parameters were solvent-to-feed ratio (S/F), reflux ratio (RR), and total number of stages (Nt) with values of 5, 3, and 20, respectively, for the case of [C(2)C(1)im][tcm] and 6, 3, and 20 for [C(2)C(1)im][dca]. High-purity products HFC-32 and HFC-125 (>99.5 wt %) were obtained with IL [C(2)C(1)im][tcm], providing the lowest energy consumption, compared to [C(2)C(1)im][dca] and other ILs.

ID EMISSIONS
AB Eating less meat is associated with a healthier body and planet. Yet, we remain reluctant to switch to a plant-based diet, largely due to the sensory experience of plant-based meat. Food scientists characterize meat using a double compression test, which only probes one-dimensional behavior. Here we use tension, compression, and shear tests-combined with constitutive neural networks-to automatically discover the behavior of eight plant-based and animal meats across the entire three-dimensional spectrum. We find that plant-based sausage and hotdog, with stiffnesses of 95.9 +/- 14.1 kPa and 38.7 +/- 3.0 kPa, successfully mimic their animal counterparts, with 63.5 +/- 45.7 kPa and 44.3 +/- 13.2 kPa, while tofurky is twice as stiff, and tofu is twice as soft. Strikingly, a complementary food tasting survey produces in nearly identical stiffness rankings for all eight products (rho = 0.833, p = 0.015). Probing the fully three-dimensional signature of meats is critical to understand subtle differences in texture that may result in a different perception of taste.

AB Objective: Cultural stress potently predicts mental health inequities, such as anxiety, among adult and adolescent immigrants in the United States. However, less work has focused on preadolescence, a period marked by neurodevelopmental and psychosocial changes that can exacerbate anxiety symptoms. Latina girls, who exhibit heightened levels of untreated anxiety, may be at elevated risk. The present study tests whether cultural stress predicts anxiety symptoms in Latina girls and their caregivers. Method: The primary caregivers of 161 predominantly Mexican-identifying Latina girls (M-age = 10.70, SD = 1.68) reported their exposure to racism, acculturative stress, and political hostility. They also reported their own and their daughter's anxiety severity. Results: To index cultural stress, a principal component was extracted from composite scores of the racism, acculturative stress, and political hostility questionnaires. Hierarchical regression analyses then tested whether the multidetermined cultural stress component predicted caregiver and child anxiety, with child age, annual household income, and subjective socioeconomic status entered at the first step. Cultural stress positively predicted caregiver (Delta R-2 = .13, p < .001) and child (Delta R-2 = .15, p < .001) anxiety symptoms over and above the observed inverse effects of subjective socioeconomic status, such that higher levels of cultural stress were associated with elevated levels of caregiver (beta = .37, p < .001) and child (beta = .39, p < .001) anxiety symptoms. Conclusions: The results of this study highlight the role of racism, acculturative stress, and political hostility in escalating anxiety symptoms in Latinx families and identify cultural stress as a factor that likely contributes to the high rates of anxiety in Latina girls during a key developmental period.

AB Synaptic vesicles (SVs) fuse with the presynaptic membrane (PM) to release neuronal transmitters. The SV protein synaptotagmin 1 (Syt1) serves as a Ca2+ sensor for evoked fusion. Syt1 is thought to trigger fusion by penetrating the PM upon Ca2+ binding; however, the mechanistic detail of this process is still debated. Syt1 interacts with the SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimidesensitive factor attachment protein receptors) complex, a coiled-coil four-helical bundle that enables the SV-PM attachment. The SNARE-associated protein complexin (Cpx) promotes Ca2 & thorn;-dependent fusion, possibly interacting with Syt1. We employed all- atom molecular dynamics to investigate the formation of the Syt1-SNARE-Cpx complex interacting with the lipid bilayers of the PM and SVs. Our simulations demonstrated that the PM-Syt1-SNARE-Cpx complex can transition to a "dead-end' state, wherein Syt1 attaches tightly to the PM but does not immerse into it, as opposed to a prefusion state, which has the tips of the Ca2 & thorn;-bound C2 domains of Syt1 inserted into the PM. Our simulations unraveled the sequence of Syt1 conformational transitions, including the simultaneous docking of Syt1 to the SNARE-Cpx bundle and the PM, followed by Ca2+chelation and the penetration of the tips of Syt1 domains into the PM, leading to the prefusion state of the protein-lipid complex. Importantly, we found that direct Syt1-Cpx interactions are required to promote these transitions. Thus, we developed the all-atom dynamic model of the conformational transitions that lead to the formation of the prefusion PM-Syt1-SNARE-Cpx complex. Our simulations also revealed an alternative deadend state of the protein-lipid complex that can be formed if this pathway is disrupted.

TI Structural classification of Ag and Cu nanocrystals with machine

SO NANOSCALE

DT Article
AB We use machine learning (ML) to classify the structures of mono-metallic Cu and Ag nanoparticles. Our datasets comprise a broad range of structures - both crystalline and amorphous - derived from parallel-tempering molecular dynamics simulations of nanoparticles in the 100-200 atom size range. We construct nanoparticle features using common neighbor analysis (CNA) signatures, and we utilize principal component analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the CNA feature set. To sort the nanoparticles into structural classes, we employed both K-means clustering and the Gaussian mixture model (GMM). We evaluated the performance of the clustering algorithms through the gap statistic and silhouette score, as well as by analysis of the CNA signatures. For Ag, we found five structural classes, with 14 detailed sub-classes, while for Cu, we found two broad classes (crystalline and amorphous), with the same five classes as for Ag, and 15 detailed sub-classes. Our results demonstrate that these ML methods are effective in identifying and categorizing nanoparticle structures to different levels of complexity, enabling us to classify nanoparticles into distinct and physically relevant structural classes with high accuracy. This capability is important for understanding nanoparticle properties and potential applications.

TI Characterization of an evolutionarily distinct bacterial ceramide kinase
   from Caulobacter crescentus
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
LA English
DT Article
ID BINDING; LIPOPOLYSACCHARIDE
AB A common feature among nearly all gram-negative bacteria is the requirement for lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the outer leaflet of the outer membrane. LPS provides structural integrity to the bacterial membrane, which aids bacteria in maintaining their shape and acts as a barrier from environmental stress and harmful substances such as detergents and antibiotics. Recent work has demonstrated that Caulobacter crescentus can survive without LPS due to the presence of the anionic sphingolipid ceramide-phosphoglycerate (CPG). Based on genetic evidence, we predicted that protein CpgB functions as a ceramide kinase and performs the first step in generating the phosphoglycerate head group. Here, we characterized the kinase activity of recombinantly expressed CpgB and demonstrated that it can phosphorylate ceramide to form ceramide 1-phosphate. The pH optimum for CpgB was 7.5, and the enzyme required Mg2+ as a cofactor. Mn2+, but no other divalent cations, could substitute for Mg2+. Under these conditions, the enzyme exhibited typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics with respect to NBD C6ceramide (Km,app = 19.2 +/- 5.5 mu M; Vmax,app = 2590 +/- 230 pmol/min/mg enzyme) and ATP (Km,app = 0.29 +/- 0.07 mM; Vmax,app = 10,100 +/- 996 pmol/min/mg enzyme). Phylogenetic analysis of CpgB revealed that CpgB belongs to a new class of ceramide kinases, which is distinct from its eukaryotic counterpart; furthermore, the pharmacological inhibitor of human ceramide kinase (NVP-231) had no effect on CpgB. The characterization of a new bacterial ceramide kinase opens avenues microbial phosphorylated sphingolipids.

AB The Ebola virus is a deadly pathogen that has been threatening public health for decades. Recent studies have revealed alternative viral invasion routes where Ebola virus approaches cells via interactions among phosphatidylserine (PS), PS binding ligands such as Gas6, and TAM family receptors such as Axl. In this study, we investigate the interactions among phosphatidylserine on the Ebola viral-like particle (VLP) membrane, human Gas6, and human Axl using atomic force microscope-based single molecule force spectroscopy to compare their binding strength and affinity from a biomechanical perspective. The impact of calcium ions on their interactions is also studied and quantified to provide more details on the calcium-dependent phosphatidylserine-Gas6 binding mechanism. Our results indicate that, in the presence of calcium ions, the binding strengths of VLP-Gas6 and VLP-Gas6-Axl increase but are still weaker than that of Gas6-Axl, and the binding affinity of VLP-Gas6 and VLP-Gas6-Axl is largely improved. The binding strength and affinity of Gas6-Axl basically remain the same, indicating no impact in the presence of calcium ions. Together, our study suggests that, under physiological conditions with calcium present, the Ebola virus can utilize its membrane phosphatidylserine to dock on cell surface via Gas6-Axl bound complex.

TI An OpenFOAM framework to model thermal bubble-driven micro-pumps
SO PHYSICS OF FLUIDS

DT Article

   COLLAPSE
AB Thermal bubble-driven micro-pumps (also known as inertial pumps) are an upcoming micro-pump technology that can be integrated directly into micro/mesofluidic channels to displace fluid without moving parts. These micro-pumps are high-power resistors that locally vaporize a thin layer of fluid above the resistor surface to form a high-pressure vapor bubble which performs mechanical work. Despite their geometric simplicity, thermal bubble-driven micro-pumps are complex to model due to the multiphysics couplings of Joule heating, thermal bubble nucleation, phase change, and multiphase flow. As such, most simulation approaches simplify the physics by neglecting Joule heating, nucleation, and phase change effects as done in this study. To date, there are no readily available, reduced physics open-source modeling tools that can resolve both pre-collapse (defined as when the bubble is expanding and collapsing) and post-collapse (defined as when the bubble has re-dissolved back into the subcooled fluid) bubble and flow dynamics. In this study, an OpenFOAM framework for modeling thermal bubble-driven micro-pumps is presented, validated, and applied. The developed OpenFOAM model agrees with both experimental data and commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software, FLOW-3D. Additionally, we assess the shape of the transient velocity profile during a pump cycle for the first time and find that it varies substantially from theoretical Poiseuille flow during pre-collapse but is within 25% of the theoretical flow profile during post-collapse. We find that this deviation is due to flow never becoming fully developed during each pump cycle. We envision the developed OpenFOAM framework as an open-source CFD toolkit for microfluidic designers to simulate devices with thermal bubble-driven micro-pumps.

AB Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) are key components of spintronic devices, such as magnetic random-access memories. Normally, MTJs consist of two ferromagnetic (FM) electrodes separated by an insulating barrier layer. Their key functional property is tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR), which is a change in MTJ's resistance when magnetization of the two electrodes alters from parallel to antiparallel. Here, we demonstrate that TMR can occur in MTJs with a single FM electrode, provided that the counterelectrode is an antiferromagnetic (AFM) metal that supports a spin -split band structure and/or a N & eacute;el spin current. Using RuO2 as a representative example of such antiferromagnet and CrO2 as a FM metal, we design all-rutile RuO2/TiO2/CrO2 MTJs to reveal a nonvanishing TMR. Our first -principles calculations predict that magnetization reversal in CrO2 significantly changes conductance of the MTJs stacked in the (110) or (001) planes. The predicted giant TMR effect of about 1000% in the (110) -oriented MTJs stems from spin -dependent conduction channels in CrO2 (110) and RuO2 (110), whose matching alters with CrO2 magnetization orientation, while TMR in the (001) -oriented MTJs originates from the N & eacute;el spin currents and different effective TiO2 barrier thickness for two magnetic sublattices that can be engineered by the alternating deposition of TiO2 and CrO2 monolayers. Our results demonstrate a possibility of a sizable TMR in MTJs with a single FM electrode and offer a practical test for using the antiferromagnet RuO2 in functional spintronic devices.

AB Cell migration via autologous chemotaxis in the presence of interstitial fluid flow is important in cancer metastasis and embryonic development. Despite significant recent progress, our understanding of flow-induced autologous chemotaxis of multicellular systems remains poor. The literature presents inconsistent findings regarding the effectiveness of collective autologous chemotaxis of densely packed cells under interstitial fluid flow. Here, we present a high-fidelity computational model to analyze the migration of multicellular systems performing autologous chemotaxis in the presence of interstitial fluid flow. Our simulations show that the details of the complex transport dynamics of the chemoattractant and fluid flow patterns that occur in the extracellular space, previously overlooked, are essential to understand this cell migration mechanism. We find that, although flow-induced autologous chemotaxis is a robust migration mechanism for individual cells, the cell-cell interactions that occur in multicellular systems render autologous chemotaxis an inefficient mechanism of collective cell migration. Our results offer new perspectives on the potential role of autologous chemotaxis in the tumor microenvironment, where fluid flow is an important modulator of transport.

AB Quantum communication infrastructures are being built worldwide to establish a quantum secure communication shield across geographical areas to protect economies, societies, and individuals from cyberthreats. It is a first step toward interconnecting nodes with classical/quantum communication, computation, and storage capabilities. However, insufficient emphasis has been placed on the fact that such infrastructure will not operate like classical networks, even though they must operate in conjunction with classical networks. In particular, classical and quantum resources can be generated and/or consumed to realize quantum protocols (e.g., a teleportation protocol consumes two classical information bits and one entanglement bit (ebit) to deliver one quantum bit (qubit)). This fundamental paradigm shift with respect to current (Shannon) classical communication brings fundamental network design challenges. In this work, we focus on the increasingly relevant space-terrestrial integrated networks, and investigate such challenges. First, we introduce the interplay between classical and quantum network resources according to the underlying theoretical limits band, and justify why the problem is significant and needs to be addressed urgently. Second, we present two illustrative numerical analyses: trade-offs between classical-quantum and classical-entanglement capacities, both over space channels. We identify (both technical and policy/ethical) research challenges ahead for the staged development of integrated quantum-classical networks as the required quantum technology becomes available. Finally, we identify the synergies with 6G usage scenarios endorsed by ITU-R.

AB The field of nuclear science has considerably advanced since its beginning just over a century ago. Today, the science of rare isotopes is on the cusp of a new era with theoretical and computing advances complementing experimental capabilities at new facilities internationally. In this article we present a vision for the science of rare isotope beams (RIBs). We do not attempt to cover the full breadth of the field; rather, we provide a perspective and address a selection of topics that reflect our own interests and expertise. We focus in particular on systems near the drip lines, where one often finds nuclei that are referred to as exotic and where the role of the nuclear continuum is only just starting to be explored. An important aspect of this article is its attempt to highlight the crucial connections between nuclear structure and the nuclear reactions required to fully interpret and leverage the rich data to be collected in the next years at RIB facilities. Further, we connect the efforts in structure and reactions to key questions of nuclear astrophysics.

AB This work was inspired by new experimental findings where we discovered a two-dimensional (2D) material comprised of titanium-oxide-based one-dimensional (1D) sub-nanometer filaments. Preliminary results suggest that the 2D material contains considerable amounts of carbon, C, in addition to titanium, Ti, and oxygen, O. The aim of this study is to investigate the low-energy, stable atomic forms of 2D titanium carbo-oxides as a function of C content. Via a combination of first-principles calculations and an effective structure sampling scheme, the stable configurations of C-substitutions are comprehensively searched by templating different 2D TiO2 polymorphs and considering a two O to one C replacement scheme. Among the searched stable configurations, a structure where the (101) planes of anatase bound the top and bottom surfaces with a chemical formula of TiC1/4O3/2 was of particularly low energy. Furthermore, the variations in the electronic band structure and chemical bonding environments caused by the high-content C substitution are investigated via additional calculations using a hybrid exchange-correlation functional.

TI Nanotube spin defects for omnidirectional magnetic field sensing
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS

DT Article
ID QUANTUM; NANOSCALE
AB Optically addressable spin defects in three-dimensional (3D) crystals and two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) materials are revolutionizing nanoscale quantum sensing. Spin defects in one-dimensional (1D) vdW nanotubes will provide unique opportunities due to their small sizes in two dimensions and absence of dangling bonds on side walls. However, optically detected magnetic resonance of localized spin defects in a nanotube has not been observed. Here, we report the observation of single spin color centers in boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) at room temperature. Our findings suggest that these BNNT spin defects possess a spin S = 1/2 ground state without an intrinsic quantization axis, leading to orientation-independent magnetic field sensing. We harness this unique feature to observe anisotropic magnetization of a 2D magnet in magnetic fields along orthogonal directions, a challenge for conventional spin S = 1 defects such as diamond nitrogen-vacancy centers. Additionally, we develop a method to deterministically transfer a BNNT onto a cantilever and use it to demonstrate scanning probe magnetometry. Further refinement of our approach will enable atomic scale quantum sensing of magnetic fields in any direction.
   Optically addressable spin defects, such as the NV centre in diamond, have enabled the nanoscale measurement of external stimuli. Here, Gao, Vaidya and coauthors observe a single spin colour centres in boron nitride nanotubes, which, due to their spin S = 1/2 ground state, allow for omnidirectional magnetic field sensing. '

TI Proton-Coupled Electron Transfer upon Oxidation of Tyrosine in a De Novo

AB Redox-active residues, such as tyrosine and tryptophan, play important roles in a wide range of biological processes. The alpha 3Y de novo protein, which is composed of three alpha helices and a tyrosine residue Y32, provides a platform for investigating the redox properties of tyrosine in a well-defined protein environment. Herein, the proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reaction that occurs upon oxidation of tyrosine in this model protein by a ruthenium photosensitizer is studied by using a vibronically nonadiabatic PCET theory that includes hydrogen tunneling and excited vibronic states. The input quantities to the analytical nonadiabatic rate constant expression, such as the diabatic proton potential energy curves and associated proton vibrational wave functions, reorganization energy, and proton donor-acceptor distribution functions, are obtained from density functional theory calculations on model systems and molecular dynamics simulations of the solvated alpha 3Y protein. Two possible proton acceptors, namely, water or a glutamate residue in the protein scaffold, are explored. The PCET rate constant is greater when glutamate is the proton acceptor, mainly due to the more favorable driving force and shorter equilibrium proton donor-acceptor distance, although contributions from excited vibronic states mitigate these effects. Nevertheless, water could be the dominant proton acceptor if its equilibrium constant associated with hydrogen bond formation is significantly greater than that for glutamate. Although these calculations do not definitively identify the proton acceptor for this PCET reaction, they elucidate the conditions under which each proton acceptor can be favored. These insights have implications for tyrosine-based PCET in a wide variety of biochemical processes.

AB Rising temperatures and varying precipitation patterns in future climates pose huge challenges to the peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) production in Southeastern U.S. (SEUS), which was characterized by hot summers and mild winters. This will require genetic improvement of peanut varieties for adapting to future climates for higher yields. Recently, several novel peanut varieties were found to exhibit higher yield and maintain photosynthesis during drought. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the spatial and temporal patterns of peanut yield response to future climate changes for peanut varieties with and without the drought tolerant trait of maintaining photosynthesis (MPh) under drought in the SEUS and evaluate the relative importance of yield related traits for enhancing yield advantage of peanut under future climate conditions. A modified version of the CROPGRO-Peanut model incorporating the drought tolerant factor was developed and validated using field trail data collected from distinct experimental sites under both rainfed and irrigated conditions. Yield was then simulated for the historical baseline period (1990-2021) and future (mid-century/2050s, late-century/2080s) climate scenarios across the SEUS. The results showed that peanut yield in the Northern SEUS was expected to benefit from climate change in the 2050s (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), but Middle SEUS and Southern SEUS would experience high probability of yield loss in the future. Comparing to the reference variety (C4), the drought tolerant peanut varieties (C1, C2 and C3) with the trait of MPh under drought could enhance the yield gains due to future climates in the 2050s (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) in Northern SEUS (yield increases from 5% to 10% for C1-C3, and 2% to 3% for C4) and mitigate the negative impacts of climate change in the 2080s (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) in the Middle (yield changes from -26% to -1% for C1-C3, and -37% to -11% for C4) and Southern SEUS (yield changes from -24% to 1% for C1-C3, and -35% to -7% for C4). The yield advantage of the drought tolerant peanut varieties in future climates was strongly associated with the higher water use efficiency (WUE), harvest index (HI), seed size, seed number, and biomass with significant P values (p < 0.001). These findings are important for local breeding and management programs to mitigate the potential impacts of climate change on peanut yield in SEUS.

TI Anomalous Transport of Small Polarons Arises from Transient Lattice
   Relaxation or Immovable Boundaries
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
ID COEFFICIENT
AB Elucidating transport mechanisms is crucial for advancing material design, yet state-of-the-art theory is restricted to exact simulations of small lattices with severe finite-size effects or approximate ones that assume the nature of transport. We leverage algorithmic advances to tame finite-size effects and exactly simulate small polaron formation and transport in the Holstein model. We further analyze the applicability of the ubiquitously used equilibrium-based Green-Kubo relations and nonequilibrium methods to predict charge mobility. We find that these methods can converge to different values and track this disparity to finite-size dependence and the sensitivity of Green-Kubo relations to the system's topology. Contrary to standard perturbative calculations, our results demonstrate that small polarons exhibit anomalous transport that manifests transiently due to nonequilibrium lattice relaxation or permanently as a signature of immovable boundaries. These findings can offer new interpretations of transport experiments on polymers and transition metal oxides.

   element method; Interface-unfitted mesh; Lowest order element
AB In this paper, we consider an enriched cut finite element method (ECFEM) with interface -unfitted meshes for solving Stokes interface equations consisting of two incompressible fluids with different viscosities. By approximating the velocity with the enriched P1 element and the pressure with the P0 element, and stabilizing the Galerkin variational formulation with suitable ghost penalty terms, we propose the new ECFEM and prove that it is well-posed and has the optimal a priori error estimate in the energy norm. All derived results are independent of the interface position. Moreover, compared with other conforming finite element methods with the optimal rate in convergence, the proposed scheme here not only has the minimum degrees of freedom, but also avoids using the derivative of the pressure in the penalty term. The presented numerical examples validate the theoretical predictions.

AB Female reproduction in squamate reptiles (lizards and snakes) is highly diverse and mode of reproduction, clutch size, and reproductive tract morphology all vary widely across this group of similar to 11,000 species. Recently, CRISPR genome editing techniques that require manipulation of the female reproductive anatomy have been developed in this group, making a more complete understanding of this anatomy essential. We describe the adult female reproductive anatomy of the model reptile the brown anole (Anolis sagrei). We show that the brown anole female reproductive tract has three distinct anteriorto-posterior regions, the infundibulum, the glandular uterus, and the nonglandular uterus. The infundibulum has a highly ciliated epithelial lip, a region where the epithelium is inverted so that cilia are present on the inside and outside of the tube. The glandular uterus has epithelial ducts that are patent with a lumen as well as acinar structures with a lumen. The nonglandular uterus has a heterogeneous morphology from anterior to posterior, with a highly folded, ciliated epithelium transitioning to a stratified squamous epithelium. This transition is accompanied by a loss of keratin-8 expression and together, these changes are similar to the morphological and gene expression changes that occur in the mammalian cervix. We recommend that description of the nonglandular uterus include the regional sub-specification of a "cervix" and "vagina" as this terminology change more accurately describes the morphology. Our data extend histological studies of reproductive organ morphology in reptiles and expand our understanding of the variation in reproductive system anatomy across squamates and vertebrates.

AB Cycles are fundamental elements in graph-structured data and have demonstrated their effectiveness in enhancing graph learning models. To encode such information into a graph learning framework, prior works often extract a summary quantity, ranging from the number of cycles to the more sophisticated persistence diagram summaries. However, more detailed information, such as which edges are encoded in a cycle, has not yet been used in graph neural networks. In this paper, we make one step towards addressing this gap, and propose a structure encoding module, called CycleNet, that encodes cycle information via edge structure encoding in a permutation invariant manner. To efficiently encode the space of all cycles, we start with a cycle basis (i.e., a minimal set of cycles generating the cycle space) which we compute via the kernel of the 1-dimensional Hodge Laplacian of the input graph. To guarantee the encoding is invariant w.r.t. the choice of cycle basis, we encode the cycle information via the orthogonal projector of the cycle basis, which is inspired by BasisNet proposed by Lim et al. We also develop a more efficient variant which however requires that the input graph has a unique shortest cycle basis. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed module, we provide some theoretical understandings of its expressive power. Moreover, we show via a range of experiments that networks enhanced by our CycleNet module perform better in various benchmarks compared to several existing SOTA models.

AB Significant acceleration of the future discovery of novel functional materials requires a fundamental shift from the current materials discovery practice, which is heavily dependent on trial-and-error campaigns and high-throughput screening, to one that builds on knowledge-driven advanced informatics techniques enabled by the latest advances in signal processing and machine learning. In this review, we discuss the major research issues that need to be addressed to expedite this transformation along with the salient challenges involved. We especially focus on Bayesian signal processing and machine learning schemes that are uncertainty aware and physics informed for knowledge-driven learning, robust optimization, and efficient objective-driven experimental design.

AB Mass spectrometry (MS) is an information rich analytical technique and plays a key role in various 'omics studies. Standard mass spectrometers are bulky and operate at high vacuum, which hinder their adoption by the broader community and utility in field applications. Developing portable mass spectrometers can significantly expand the application scope and user groups of MS analysis. This review discusses the basics and recent advancements in the development of key components of portable mass spectrometers including ionization source, mass analyzer, detector, and vacuum system. Further, major areas where portable mass spectrometers are applied are also discussed. Finally, a perspective on the further development of portable mass spectrometers including the potential benefits for 'omics analysis is provided.

AB Many textbook physical effects in crystals are enabled by some specific symmetries. In contrast to such 'apparent effects', 'hidden effect X' refers to the general condition where the nominal global system symmetry would disallow the effect X, whereas the symmetry of local sectors within the crystal would enable effect X. Known examples include the hidden Rashba and/or hidden Dresselhaus spin polarization that require spin-orbit coupling, but unlike their apparent counterparts are demonstrated to exist in non-magnetic systems even in inversion-symmetric crystals. Here, we discuss hidden spin polarization effect in collinear antiferromagnets without the requirement for spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Symmetry analysis suggests that antiferromagnets hosting such effect can be classified into six types depending on the global vs local symmetry. We identify which of the possible collinear antiferromagnetic compounds will harbor such hidden polarization and validate these symmetry enabling predictions with first-principles density functional calculations for several representative compounds. This will boost the theoretical and experimental efforts in finding new spin-polarized materials.
   A hidden effect can occur in materials where locally a symmetry is broken, even though global symmetry is preserved. An example is hidden spin-polarization, arising from local inversion symmetry breaking in otherwise globally centro-symmetric materials. Here, Yuan et al uncover a hidden spin-polarization that can occur in antiferromagnets without spin-orbit coupling and identify the key material requirements for this to occur.

ID FIRE MANAGEMENT
AB This study investigates the complexities faced by emergency managers in wildfire-prone areas to uncover pressing issues and potential solutions. Four themes are discerned through three focus group discussions with emergency managers from nine counties across California. First, there is unequal access to resources for both risk assessment and response, with counties that have fewer resources facing significant challenges in effectively managing wildfire risks. Second, effective risk communication depends on the available resources and the unique characteristics of each community. Participants stress the need for improved communication tools to reach vulnerable groups (e.g., seniors, individuals with disabilities, non-English-speaking residents). Third, the complexity and confusion surrounding multi-level collaboration in wildfire management is a recurring theme. Participants note that unclear roles and responsibilities between state and federal agencies hinder response efforts, underscoring the need for better coordination and transparent communication at all levels. Fourth, innovative responses (e.g., creative evacuation strategies, collaborative efforts) are recognized as imperative for managing wildfires and their cascading impacts in resource-constrained areas. The findings highlight that achieving equitable and effective preparation, response, and resilience for vulnerable communities requires a comprehensive understanding of wildfire severity and community susceptibility, coupled with active collaboration among emergency managers, policymakers, and both governmental and non-governmental organizations.

AB Recent years have witnessed the remarkable progress of deep learning within the realm of scientific disciplines, yielding a wealth of promising outcomes. A prominent challenge within this domain has been the task of predicting enzyme function, a complex problem that has seen the development of numerous computational methods, particularly those rooted in deep learning techniques. However, the majority of these methods have primarily focused on either amino acid sequence data or protein structure data, neglecting the potential synergy of combining both modalities. To address this gap, we propose a Contrastive Learning framework for Enzyme functional ANnotation prediction combined with protein amino acid sequences and Contact maps (CLEAN-Contact). We rigorously evaluate the performance of our CLEAN-Contact framework against the state-of-the-art enzyme function prediction models using multiple benchmark datasets. Using CLEAN-Contact, we predict previously unknown enzyme functions within the proteome of Prochlorococcus marinus MED4. Our findings convincingly demonstrate the substantial superiority of our CLEAN-Contact framework, marking a significant step forward in enzyme function prediction accuracy.

AB This study aims to investigate how assimilating GOES-16 ABI infrared brightness temperature (BT) with different microphysics schemes affects the convection-allowing analysis and prediction of the 3 May 2020 bow echo case. The Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation-based Ensemble Kalman Filter (GSI-EnKF) system and Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model are utilized to conduct data assimilation (DA) experiments using Thompson, WDM6, NSSL, and Morrison microphysics schemes. Correlation structures between BT and model state variables indicate that assimilating infrared BT can adjust bowing MCS dynamics via latent cooling and the rear inflow jet. Such corrections during DA cycling enhance the rear inflow jet and bow echo size, primarily for microphysics schemes featuring faster hydrometeor fall velocity and stronger latent cooling. The improved analyses lead to better forecasts of the bow echo's shape, size, timing of the bowing process, and wind speeds. Substituting a larger microphysics-dependent effective radius for a constant default value increases prior BT, the magnitude of BT innovations, and accumulated impact on the rear inflow jet, especially for the WDM6 and Morrison schemes. In the subsequent forecasts, incorporating microphysics-dependent effective radius further improves the experiment using the Morrison scheme but degrades it when using the WDM6 scheme.
   Past studies have shown that incorporating infrared radiance observations, sensitive to water vapor and cloud top, into weather prediction models enhances the analysis of current weather conditions and the forecast accuracy for severe weather events. However, previous studies focused only on a single method to parameterize cloud particles and did not explore how cloud particle characteristics-such as falling speed, phase changes, and scattered size-affect the assimilation of these infrared radiance observations into model states. This study investigates how different cloud parameterization methods affect the analysis and forecast of a severe weather event on 3 May 2020. Our findings illustrate that using infrared radiance observations from the GOES-16 satellite adjusts the dynamics of a bow echo, enhancing evaporation and circulation within the storm. These adjustments notably improve the forecast accuracy for the bow echo's shape, size, timing, and wind speeds. Employing parameterization methods with faster cloud falling speeds and stronger evaporation intensifies the storm's circulation, resulting in a wider bow echo and a subsequent area of severe wind damage in the forecast. Furthermore, assigning large scattered particle sizes based on the applied cloud parameterization methods can either enhance or degrade the severe storm forecast.
   Assimilation of all-sky infrared radiance improves analysis and forecast of bow echo dynamics Microphysics schemes affect assimilating all-sky radiance through latent cooling and hydrometeor fall velocity assumption Improving consistency in effective radius between forward operator and microphysics scheme also affects assimilation results of all-sky radiances depending on schemes

AB We propose a novel method to study properties of graph-structured data by means of a geometric construction called Dowker complex. We study this simplicial complex through the use of persistent homology, which has shown to be a prominent tool to uncover relevant geometric and topological information in data. A positively weighted graph induces a distance in its sets of vertices. A classical approach in persistent homology is to construct a filtered Vietoris-Rips complex with vertices on the vertices of the graph. However, when the size of the set of vertices of the graph is large, the obtained simplicial complex may be computationally hard to handle. A solution The Dowker complex is constructed on a sample in the set of vertices of the graph called landmarks. A way to guaranty sparsity and proximity of the set of landmarks to all the vertices of the graph is by considering epsilon-nets. We provide theoretical proofs of the stability of the Dowker construction and comparison with the Vietorips-Rips construction. We perform experiments showing that the Dowker complex based neural networks model performs good with respect to baseline methods in tasks such as link prediction and resilience to attacks.

AB Somatosensory neuroprostheses are devices with the potential to restore the senses of touch and movement from prosthetic limbs for people with limb amputation or paralysis. By electrically stimulating the peripheral or central nervous system, these devices evoke sensations that appear to emanate from the missing or insensate limb, and when paired with sensors on the prosthesis, they can improve the functionality and embodiment of the prosthesis. There have been major advances in the design of these systems over the past decade, although several important steps remain before they can achieve widespread clinical adoption outside the lab setting. Here, we provide a brief overview of somatosensory neuroprostheses and explores these hurdles and potential next steps towards clinical translation.

AB Non-canonical nucleobase pairs differ from canonical Watson-Crick (WC) pairs in their hydrogen bonding patterns. This study uses density functional theory with empirical dispersion correction to examine the stability and electronic properties of free adenine dimers stabilized by hydrogen bonds along the WC, Sugar (S), and Hoogsteen (H) edges. Dispersion correction is crucial for accurate interaction energy evaluation. The most stable adenine dimer is stabilized by N-H & ctdot;N hydrogen bonds in gas and solvent phases. Binding energy decreases by similar to 10.2 kcal mol-1 for dimers with both C-H & ctdot;N and N-H & ctdot;N bonds, increasing the donor-acceptor distance. However, with a sugar-phosphate backbone, dimers with C-H & ctdot;N and N-H & ctdot;N bonds have higher binding energy in an implicit solvent, emphasizing the role of C-H & ctdot;N interactions in stability and nucleic acid folding dynamics. This study highlights noncovalent interactions, such as hydrogen bonding and pi-pi stacking, within adenine pairs with potential applications in biosensing and DNA-based self-assembly on nanomaterial interfaces.

AB While halide double perovskites A2M(I)M(III)X6 have attracted significant attention, examples involving iodides are rare. We examine the limits of the structural stability of iodide double perovskites, presenting the synthesis and single-crystal structures of Cs2NaScI6 and Cs2NaYI6. Bypassing the common expectation that iodides have small band gaps, these compounds display optical gaps of 3.10 eV [M(III) = Sc] and 3.65 eV [M(III) = Y]. Cs2NaScI6 is the only iodide double perovskite to exhibit a cubic crystal structure at room temperature. Density functional theory-based electronic structure calculations help understand the role of competing Cs3M(III)2I9 (3 : 2 : 9) phases and provide possible reasons for why iodide double perovskites based around In(III), Sb(III) and Bi(III) cations have proved elusive. We confirm design rules for halide double perovskites based around concepts of the tolerance factor and the radius ratio of the smaller, trivalent ion, but also point to situations such as what is observed for Cs2NaScI6 where a double perovskite can be trapped in a metastable structure.

   thermal emitter; fluctuational electrodynamics
AB Conventional thermal emitters, such as a blackbody or the incandescent filament of a light bulb, lack the directionality or narrow linewidth required in many applications such as thermophotovoltaics and infrared sensing. Although thermal emission from bulk materials is well understood based on phenomenological heat transfer concepts like emissivity and the framework of classical electrodynamics, there still remains a significant gap in our understanding of thermal emission at the nanoscale. In this work, by leveraging the quasi-normal mode theory, we derive a general and self-consistent formalism to describe the thermal radiation from nanoscale resonant thermal emitters with high-order symmetric geometries, which are the basic building blocks of metasurfaces and metamaterials. The complex symmetrical geometries of the emitters yield degeneracy of quasi-normal modes. The introduction of the degeneracy can strongly mediate far-field thermal emission from nanoscale resonators, which is closely correlated to the number of degenerate modes and the coupling among the degenerate modes. Our formalism from the quasi-normal mode theory serves as a general guideline to design the complex metastructures with high-ordered degeneracy to achieve optimized absorption or emission capabilities.

AB Patient privacy is a major barrier to healthcare AI. For confidentiality reasons, most patient data remains in silo in separate hospitals, preventing the design of data-driven healthcare AI systems that need large volumes of patient data to make effective decisions. A solution to this is collective learning across multiple sites through federated learning with differential privacy. However, literature in this space typically focuses on differentially private statistical estimation and machine learning, which is different from the causal inference-related problems that arise in healthcare. In this work, we take a fresh look at federated learning with a focus on causal inference; specifically, we look at estimating the average treatment effect (ATE), an important task in causal inference for healthcare applications, and provide a federated analytics approach to enable ATE estimation across multiple sites along with differential privacy (DP) guarantees at each site. The main challenge comes from site heterogeneity-different sites have different sample sizes and privacy budgets. We address this through a class of persite estimation algorithms that reports the ATE estimate and its variance as a quality measure, and an aggregation algorithm on the server side that minimizes the overall variance of the final ATE estimate. Our experiments on real and synthetic data show that our method reliably aggregates private statistics across sites and provides better privacy-utility tradeoff under site heterogeneity than baselines.

AB The naturally occurring variability in our movements often poses a significant challenge when attempting to produce precise and accurate actions, which is readily evident when playing a game of darts. Two differing, yet potentially complementary, control strategies that the sensorimotor system may use to regulate movement variability are impedance control and feedback control. Greater muscular co-contraction leads to greater impedance that acts to stabilize the hand, while visuomotor feedback responses can be used to rapidly correct for unexpected deviations when reaching toward a target. Here, we examined the in-dependent roles and potential interplay of impedance control and visuomotor feedback control when regulating movement vari-ability. Participants were instructed to perform a precise reaching task by moving a cursor through a narrow visual channel. We manipulated cursor feedback by visually amplifying movement variability and/or delaying the visual feedback of the cursor. We found that participants decreased movement variability by increasing muscular co-contraction, aligned with an impedance control strategy. Participants displayed visuomotor feedback responses during the task but, unexpectedly, there was no modulation between conditions. However, we did find a relationship between muscular co-contraction and visuomotor feedback responses, suggesting that participants modulated impedance control relative to feedback control. Taken together, our results highlight that the sensorimotor system modulates muscular co-contraction, relative to visuomotor feedback responses, to regulate movement variability and produce accurate actions.NEW & NOTEWORTHY The sensorimotor system has the constant challenge of dealing with the naturally occurring variability in our movements. Here, we investigated the potential roles of muscular co-contraction and visuomotor feedback responses to reg-ulate movement variability. When we visually amplified movements, we found that the sensorimotor system primarily uses mus-cular co-contraction to regulate movement variability. Interestingly, we found that muscular co-contraction was modulated relative to inherent visuomotor feedback responses, suggesting an interplay between impedance and feedback control.

TI Model predictive control of non-interacting active Brownian particles
SO SOFT MATTER
LA English
DT Article
AB Active matter systems are strongly driven to assume non-equilibrium distributions owing to their self-propulsion, e.g., flocking and clustering. Controlling the active matter systems' spatiotemporal distributions offers exciting applications such as directed assembly, programmable materials, and microfluidic actuation. However, these applications involve environments with coupled dynamics and complex tasks, making intuitive control strategies insufficient. This necessitates the development of an automatic feedback control framework, where an algorithm determines appropriate actions based on the system's current state. In this work, we control the distribution of active Brownian particles by applying model predictive control (MPC), a model-based control algorithm that predicts future states and optimizes the control inputs to drive the system along a user-defined objective. The MPC model is based on the Smoluchowski equation with a self-propulsive convective term and an actuated spatiotemporal-varying external field that aligns particles with the applied direction, similar to a magnetic field. We apply the MPC framework to control a Brownian dynamics simulation of non-interacting active particles and illustrate the controller capabilities with two objectives: splitting and juggling sub-populations, and polar order flocking control.
   Model predictive control is used to guide the spatiotemporal distribution of active Brownian particles by forecasting future states and optimizing control inputs to achieve tasks like dividing a population into two groups.

AB Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), which has two amine and four carboxylate protonation sites, forms stable complexes with lanthanide ions. This work analyzes the coordination structure, in atomic resolution, of the Eu3+ ion complexed with EDTA in all its protonation states in aqueous solution. Eu-EDTA complexes were modeled using classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using force field parameters optimized with ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. Structures from the MD simulations were used to predict extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra and compared with EXAFS measurements of the Eu3+ aqua ion and Eu-EDTA complexes at pH 3 and 11. This work details how Eu-EDTA complex coordination structures change with increasing protonation of the EDTA ligand in the complex, from the tightly bound unprotonated complex to the unbinding of the fully protonated EDTA ligand from the Eu3+ ion as both become solvated by water. Agreement between predicted and measured EXAFS spectra supports the findings from simulation.
   The structures of Eu-EDTA complexes at varying protonation state in aqueous solution are resolved with a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and extended X-ray absorption fine structure measurements. image

AB PurposeAgricultural residues have the potential to be used for biochar production and utilization as a soil amendment. However, the decomposition dynamics of plant and animal residue biochar and their impacts on soil health and carbon (C) stability have not been well studied. This study evaluated soil health, crop productivity, greenhouse gas emissions, and C mineralization kinetics after amendment with agricultural residue biochar.MethodsBiochar derived from cattle manure (CM), hemp wood (HW), and pecan wood (PW) were applied in soil at 1% w/w, and sorghum was cultivated for three months in greenhouse pots. Soils from the pot experiment were subsequently incubated in the laboratory for three months, and decomposition data were fitted to C mineralization kinetic models.ResultsSoil organic carbon (SOC) was 72% greater in PW-amended soils than in the control. The CM-amended soil had a 9% greater cation exchange capacity, 28% higher fungi/bacteria ratio, and 24% greater saprophytes than the control. While CM had 47% more grain yield than the control, plant residue biochar maintained greater gram-positive and actinobacteria abundances, and ultimately, more C at the end of laboratory incubation. Total C mineralized during 91-day incubation was lowest in HW and highest in CM. The first-order kinetic model best described C mineralization for PW and HW, while the double exponential model best fitted for CM-amended soils.ConclusionPlant residue biochars enhanced SOC storage, while manure biochar increased soil nutrients and crop yields. The difference in decomposition was related to the composition of plant and animal residue biochar.

AB We used ab initio grand-canonical Monte Carlo (AIGCMC) simulations based on plane-wave density-functional theory to probe the structures and surface energies of Pt(100) and Pt(111) with adsorbed chlorine. For Pt(100), we considered both the (1 x 1) surface and a (5 x 1) reconstruction, as a model for the experimentally observed " hex " reconstruction of Pt(100). We constructed phase diagrams of the surface energies as function of the Cl chemical potential and identified the most relevant surfaces. For Pt(100), we find the hex reconstruction is favored at low Cl chemical potentials and that Cl adsorption lifts the reconstruction. The progression of ordered structures predicted for this surface is: bare (5 x 1) Pt(100), Theta = 1/2 (1 x 1) Pt(100), and Theta = 2/3 (1 x 1) Pt (100), where Theta is the fractional surface coverage of Cl. All these structures are seen experimentally. We also observe a structure with Theta = 3/4 and intermixing between Pt and Cl on Pt(100) that is related to the structure at Theta = 2/3. For Pt(111), we find a progression of (3 x 3) unit cells at Theta = 1/9, 1/3, 4/9, 5/9, and 2/3. The structures at Theta = 1/3 and 4/9 have been proposed experimentally and most experiments predict a series of (3 x 3) unit cells with increasing Cl coverage. If intermixing between Cl and Pt does not occur in experiment, then we find a (4 x 2) Cl structure at Theta = 1/2 is energetically favored, as is observed in experiment. A strength of AIGCMC is the capability to identify relevant structures, including disordered structures, without predefined input. This increases the chance of having high fidelity to experiment and identifying relevant substrates for applications.

AB BackgroundThe quality of treatment plans for breast cancer can vary greatly. This variation could be reduced by using dose prediction to automate treatment planning. Our work investigates novel methods for training deep-learning models that are capable of producing high-quality dose predictions for breast cancer treatment planning.PurposeThe goal of this work was to compare the performance impact of two novel techniques for deep learning dose prediction models for tangent field treatments for breast cancer. The first technique, a "glowing" mask algorithm, encodes the distance from a contour into each voxel in a mask. The second, a gradient-weighted mean squared error (MSE) loss function, emphasizes the error in high-dose gradient regions in the predicted image.MethodsFour 3D U-Net deep learning models were trained using the planning CT and contours of the heart, lung, and tumor bed as inputs. The dataset consisted of 305 treatment plans split into 213/46/46 training/validation/test sets using a 70/15/15% split. We compared the impact of novel "glowing" anatomical mask inputs and a novel gradient-weighted MSE loss function to their standard counterparts, binary anatomical masks, and MSE loss, using an ablation study methodology. To assess performance, we examined the mean error and mean absolute error (ME/MAE) in dose across all within-body voxels, the error in mean dose to heart, ipsilateral lung, and tumor bed, dice similarity coefficient (DSC) across isodose volumes defined by 0%-100% prescribed dose thresholds, and gamma analysis (3%/3 mm).ResultsThe combination of novel glowing masks and gradient weighted loss function yielded the best-performing model in this study. This model resulted in a mean ME of 0.40%, MAE of 2.70%, an error in mean dose to heart and lung of -0.10 and 0.01 Gy, and an error in mean dose to the tumor bed of -0.01%. The median DSC at 50/95/100% isodose levels were 0.91/0.87/0.82. The mean 3D gamma pass rate (3%/3 mm) was 93%.ConclusionsThis study found the combination of novel anatomical mask inputs and loss function for dose prediction resulted in superior performance to their standard counterparts. These results have important implications for the field of radiotherapy dose prediction, as the methods used here can be easily incorporated into many other dose prediction models for other treatment sites. Additionally, this dose prediction model for breast radiotherapy has sufficient performance to be used in an automated planning pipeline for tangent field radiotherapy and has the major benefit of not requiring a PTV for accurate dose prediction.

AB Algorithms with predictions is a new research direction that leverages machine learned predictions for algorithm design. So far a plethora of recent works have incorporated predictions to improve on worst-case bounds for online problems. In this paper, we initiate the study of complexity of dynamic data structures with predictions, including dynamic graph algorithms. Unlike online algorithms, the goal in dynamic data structures is to maintain the solution efficiently with every update.
   We investigate three natural models of prediction: (1) 6-accurate predictions where each predicted request matches the true request with probability S, (2) list-accurate predictions where a true request comes from a list of possible requests, and (3) bounded delay predictions where the true requests are a permutation of the predicted requests. We give general reductions among the prediction models, showing that bounded delay is the strongest prediction model, followed by list-accurate, and 6-accurate.
   Further, we identify two broad problem classes based on lower bounds due to the Online Matrix Vector (OMv) conjecture. Specifically, we show that locally correctable dynamic problems have strong conditional lower bounds for list-accurate predictions that are equivalent to the non-prediction setting, unless list-accurate predictions are perfect. Moreover, we show that locally reducible dynamic problems have time complexity that degrades gracefully with the quality of bounded delay predictions. We categorize problems with known OMv lower bounds accordingly and give several upper bounds in the delay model that show that our lower bounds are almost tight.
   We note that concurrent work by v.d.Brand et al. [SODA '24] and Liu and Srinivas [arXiv:2307.08890] independently study dynamic graph algorithms with predictions, but their work is mostly focused on showing upper bounds.

AB The cell membrane must balance mechanical stability with fluidity to function as both a barrier and an organizational platform. Key to this balance is the ordering of hydrocarbon chains and the packing of lipids. Many eukaryotes synthesize sterols, which are uniquely capable of modulating the lipid order to decouple membrane stability from fluidity. Ancient sterol analogs known as hopanoids are found in many bacteria and proposed as ancestral ordering lipids. The juxtaposition of sterols and hopanoids in extant organisms prompts us to ask why both pathways persist, especially in light of their convergent ability to order lipids. In this work, simulations, monolayer experiments, and cellular assays show that hopanoids and sterols order unsaturated phospholipids differently based on the position of double bonds in the phospholipid acyl chain. We find that cholesterol and diplopterol's methyl group distributions lead to distinct effects on unsaturated lipids. In Mesoplasma forum, diplopterol's constrained ordering capacity reduces membrane resistance to osmotic stress, unlike cholesterol. These findings suggest that cholesterol's broader lipidordering ability may have facilitated the exploration of a more diverse lipidomic landscape in eukaryotic membranes.

AB Robotic manipulation of small objects has shown great potential for engineering, biology, and chemistry research. However, existing robotic platforms have difficulty in achieving contactless, high-resolution, 4-degrees-of-freedom (4-DOF) manipulation of small objects, and noninvasive maneuvering of objects in regions shielded by tissue and bone barriers. Here, we present chirality-tunable acoustic vortex tweezers that can tune acoustic vortex chirality, transmit through biological barriers, trap single micro- to millimeter-sized objects, and control object rotation. Assisted by programmable robots, our acoustic systems further enable contactless, high-resolution translation of single objects. Our systems were demonstrated by tuning acoustic vortex chirality, controlling object rotation, and translating objects along arbitrary-shaped paths. Moreover, we used our systems to trap single objects in regions with tissue and skull barriers and translate an object inside a Y-shaped channel of a thick biomimetic phantom. In addition, we showed the function of ultrasound imaging-assisted acoustic manipulation by monitoring acoustic object manipulation via live ultrasound imaging.

AB Several lung diseases lead to alterations in regional lung mechanics, including ventilator- and radiation-induced lung injuries. Such alterations can lead to localized underventilation of the affected areas, resulting in the overdistension of the surrounding healthy regions. Thus, there has been growing interest in quantifying the dynamics of the lung parenchyma using regional biomechanical markers. Image registration through dynamic imaging has emerged as a powerful tool to assess lung parenchyma's kinematic and deformation behaviors during respiration. However, the difficulty in validating the image registration estimation of lung deformation, primarily due to the lack of ground-truth deformation data, has limited its use in clinical settings. To address this barrier, we developed a method to convert a finite-element (FE) mesh of the lung into a phantom computed tomography (CT) image, advantageously possessing ground-truth information included in the FE model. The phantom CT images generated from the FE mesh replicated the geometry of the lung and large airways that were included in the FE model. Using spatial frequency response, we investigated the effect of "imaging parameters" such as voxel size (resolution) and proximity threshold values on image quality. A series of high-quality phantom images generated from the FE model simulating the respiratory cycle will allow for the validation and evaluation of image registration-based estimations of lung deformation. In addition, the present method could be used to generate synthetic data needed to train machine-learning models to estimate kinematic biomarkers from medical images that could serve as important diagnostic tools to assess heterogeneous lung injuries.

To derive structural descriptors of the nanoparticles, we employed Common Neighbor Analysis, followed by dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis and clustering using K-Means and the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). We evaluated the clustering models using the silhouette score and the gap statistic. These measures showed that GMM provides more physically meaningful clustering than K-Means. Through GMM clustering, we obtained five distinct shape and composition classes and 14 different sub-classes. Our analysis shows these different classes and sub-classes reflect the shape, Cu(Ag) content, temperature, and fraction of Ag(Cu) on the nanoparticle surface. This approach of combined atomic-scale simulations and machine learning methods enhances our understanding of the structures in bimetallic nanoparticles and provides valuable insights for designing nanomaterials with tailored properties for applications.

TI Super-resolution techniques to simulate electronic spectra of large

SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS

AB An accurate treatment of electronic spectra in large systems with a technique such as time-dependent density functional theory is computationally challenging. Due to the Nyquist sampling theorem, direct real-time simulations must be prohibitively long to achieve suitably sharp resolution in frequency space. Super-resolution techniques such as compressed sensing and MUSIC assume only a small number of excitations contribute to the spectrum, which fails in large molecular systems where the number of excitations is typically very large. We present an approach that combines exact short-time dynamics with approximate frequency space methods to capture large narrow features embedded in a dense manifold of smaller nearby peaks. We show that our approach can accurately capture narrow features and a broad quasi-continuum of states simultaneously, even when the features overlap in frequency. Our approach is able to reduce the required simulation time to achieve reasonable accuracy by a factor of 20-40 with respect to standard Fourier analysis and shows promise for accurately predicting the whole spectrum of large molecules and materials.
   Calculating electronic spectra of large systems is computationally challenging. Here, the authors combine exact short-time dynamics with approximate frequency space methods to capture narrow features embedded in a dense manifold of smaller peaks.

AB Cationic palladium catalysts containing N-heterocyclic carbene ligands were found to be effective catalysts for the chain-growth polymerization of monomers based on a fused [2.2.1]:[2.2.2] ring system. The shape-persistent monomers prevent dense packing of polymer chains and produce intrinsic microporosity in polymer solids. Gas absorption isotherm measurements reveal that surface areas greater than 1000 m2 g-1 are produced in some materials. High molecular weight materials are produced, and catalyst optimization studies reveal that the steric bulk and electronic nature of the N-heterocyclic carbene ligands play dominant roles in determining the efficiency of the polymerization. The hydrocarbon nature of the microporous polymers enables methane absorption even at high humidity levels, which has anticipated utility in the creation of concentrators for robust point methane sensors.

AB Ammonia synthesis has significant implications for global energy and environmental issues, driving the need for highly active catalysts that operate under mild conditions. This study reports the successful deposition of uniform similar to 1.0 nm metallic ruthenium (Ru) nanoclusters onto Ba-LaCeOx particles via atomic layer deposition (ALD). The catalytic performance of the ALD-prepared Ru nanoclusters was assessed for ammonia synthesis and compared with two catalysts produced by conventional incipient wetness impregnation. For the ALD-prepared Ru nanoclusters, a pre-reaction H-2-reduction step induced partial encapsulation of suboxide species on Ru sites due to strong metal-support interactions, limiting Ru nanocluster sintering and maintaining a reduced Ru size of 1.7 nm. The electron donation from the reduced support to Ru sites imparted an electron-rich character, which facilitated the weakening of the NN bond and promoted the rate-determining step of ammonia synthesis. The ALD-Ru catalysts exhibited competitive ammonia synthesis activity under milder conditions, compared to the impregnated catalysts, with a lower requirement for initial reaction temperature. These results highlight the potential of ALD-synthesized Ru nanoclusters as highly efficient catalysts for low-temperature ammonia production, offering a promising avenue for advancing ammonia synthesis technologies.

AB Multi-task learning (MTL) has become increasingly popular in natural language processing (NLP) because it improves the performance of related tasks by exploiting their commonalities and differences. Nevertheless, it is still not understood very well how multi-task learning can be implemented based on the relatedness of training tasks. In this survey, we review recent advances of multi-task learning methods in NLP, with the aim of summarizing them into two general multi-task training methods based on their task relatedness: (i) joint training and (ii) multi-step training. We present examples in various NLP downstream applications, summarize the task relationships and discuss future directions of this promising topic.

AB Background The increased interest in why and how trees die from fire has led to several syntheses of the potential mechanisms of fire-induced tree mortality. However, these generally neglect to consider experimental methods used to simulate fire behaviour conditions.Aims To describe, evaluate the appropriateness of and provide a historical timeline of the different approaches that have been used to simulate fire behaviour in fire-induced tree mortality studies.Methods We conducted a historical review of the different actual and fire proxy methods that have been used to further our understanding of fire-induced tree mortality.Key results Most studies that assess the mechanisms of fire-induced tree mortality in laboratory settings make use of fire proxies instead of real fires and use cut branches instead of live plants.Implications Further research should assess mechanisms of fire-induced tree mortality using live plants in paired combustion laboratory and landscape fire experiments.

ID CONSEQUENCES
AB Anthropogenic stressors like overfishing, fi shing, land based runoff, and increasing temperatures cause the degradation of coral reefs, leading to the loss of corals and other calcifiers, fi ers, increases in competitive fl eshy algae, and increases in microbial pathogen abundance and hypoxia. To test the hypothesis that corals would be healthier by moving them off the benthos, a common garden experiment was conducted in which corals were translocated to midwater geodesic spheres (hereafter called Coral Reef Arks or Arks). Coral fragments translocated to the Arks survived significantly fi cantly longer than equivalent coral fragments translocated to Control sites (i.e., i.e ., benthos at the same depth). Over time, average living coral surface area and volume were higher on the Arks than the Control sites. The abundance and biomass of fi sh were also generally higher on the Arks compared to the Control sites, with more piscivorous fi sh on the Arks. The addition of Autonomous Reef Monitoring Structures (ARMS), which served as habitat for sessile and motile reef-associated organisms, also generally significantly fi cantly increased fi sh associated with the Arks. Overall, the Arks increased translocated coral survivorship and growth, and exhibited knock-on effects such as higher fi sh abundance.

AB The coupling between antiferromagnetic spins and infrared-active phonons in solids is responsible for many intriguing phenomena and is a field of intense research with extensive potential applications in the modern devices based on antiferromagnetic spintronics and phononics. Insulating rutile antiferromagnetic crystal CoF2 is one of the model materials for studying nonlinear magnetophononics due to the strong spin-lattice coupling as a result of the orbitally degenerate ground state of Co2+ ions manifested in the plethora of static and induced piezomagnetic effects. Here we report results on the complete infrared spectroscopy study of lattice and magnetic dynamics in CoF2 in a wide temperature range and their careful analysis. We observed that infrared-active phonons demonstrate frequency shifts at the antiferromagnetic ordering. Furthermore, using first-principles calculations, we examined the lattice dynamics and disclosed that these frequency shifts are rather due to the spin-phonon coupling than geometrical lattice effects. Next we found that the low-frequency dielectric permittivity demonstrates distinct changes at the antiferromagnetic ordering due to the spontaneous magnetodielectric effect caused by the behavior of infrared-active phonons. In addition, we have observed magnetic excitations in the infrared spectra and identified their magnetodipole origin. To strengthen our conclusions, we analyze the theoretical phonon-magnon coupling overall phonons at the I' point. We conclude that the largest effect comes from the A1g and B2g Raman-active modes. As such, our results establish a solid basis for further investigations and more deeper understanding of the coupling of phonons with spins and magnetic excitations in antiferromagnets.

AB Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), with their unique porous structures and versatile functionality, have emerged as promising materials for the adsorption, separation, and storage of diverse molecular species. In this study, we investigate water adsorption in MOF-808, a prototypical MOF that shares the same secondary building unit (SBU) as UiO-66, and elucidate how differences in topology and connectivity between the two MOFs influence the adsorption mechanism. To this end, molecular dynamics simulations were performed to calculate several thermodynamic and dynamical properties of water in MOF-808 as a function of relative humidity (RH), from the initial adsorption step to full pore filling. At low RH, the mu(3)-OH groups of the SBUs form hydrogen bonds with the initial water molecules entering the pores, which triggers the filling of these pores before the mu(3)-OH groups in other pores become engaged in hydrogen bonding with water molecules. Our analyses indicate that the pores of MOF-808 become filled by water sequentially as the RH increases. A similar mechanism has been reported for water adsorption in UiO-66. Despite this similarity, our study highlights distinct thermodynamic properties and framework characteristics that influence the adsorption process differently in MOF-808 and UiO-66.

AB Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) represents an emerging paradigm within the domain of cognitive computing, inspired by the information processing mechanisms observed in the human brain. Despite the research efforts devoted to improving and extending HDC algorithms and hardware, the efficacy and privacy of HDC remains challenging in handling image data. In this study, we highlight the accuracy, efficiency and privacy concerns of existing HDC-based methods on image data. We propose a novel vector-free encoding that shrinks the energy consumption and obviates the need for vector storage. We repurpose the released resources to augment the proposed encoding with a well crafted and privacy-aware feature extractor. Experimental results indicate that our proposed design, designated as VisionHD, gains a significant accuracy improvement (> 22%) while its energy consumption remains within the confines of the baseline HDC. To evaluate the privacy of VisionHD, we introduce a more effective and generic reversing technique, which reveals that VisionHD successfully obfuscates the information and improves the privacy metric by 16.9x.

AB Students often experience social and psychological barriers to success in General Chemistry, which is a key gateway to many students' science pathways. Learning assistants (LAs) have the potential to reduce these barriers and to strengthen students' sense of belonging in General Chemistry and STEM more broadly. Here, we used a 17-item Likert scale to determine whether incorporating LAs into General Chemistry I and II enhances students' sense of belonging in these courses. The incorporation of LAs into General Chemistry I had a significant positive effect and a medium to large effect size for students in all student groups examined: women and men; students in both racially and ethnically underrepresented and well-represented groups; first- and continuing-generation students. In General Chemistry II, similar results were observed for women and men; students in well-represented racial and ethnic groups; continuing-generation students. Further, we asked students to reflect on the impact that working with LAs had on their sense of belonging in STEM and confidence in talking about science. Sixty percent of students indicated that working with LAs had a positive impact on their STEM belonging, with five themes describing LA impacts: reducing isolation, serving as inspirational role models, providing mentoring, increasing opportunities for engagement and confidence building, and serving as accessible and approachable sources of support. Sixty-one percent of students also indicated that working with LAs increased their confidence in talking about science, with three themes emerging: fostering an environment with a lower risk of negative judgment, providing increased opportunities for feedback, and supporting students as they practiced their growing skills. Together, these results indicate that LAs can be an important means to reduce social and psychological barriers for students in gateway science courses, increasing their sense that they belong to the class and STEM more broadly.

AB Molecular p-type dopants, widely used to electrically dope semiconducting polymers, are challenging to design because of the requirements for their redox potentials. Redox-active dopants with radical cations present a strategy to achieve effective doping and to increase their synthetic versatility. A p-type dopant from a phenothiazine radical-cation bearing polymeric ionic liquid (PIL) with an associated bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)azanide ((CF3SO2)2N-, TFSI-) counterion was investigated. The structure of the polymeric dopant limits mass diffusion into solid polymer films allowing charge transfer to occur only at interfaces. Electron transfer between the phenothiazine radical cation and model semiconducting polymers was found to be similar in both the small molecule and pendant attached polymer. The kinetics of charge transfer upon forming bilayers with the PIL and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) was investigated and the limiting factor was found to be mass diffusion of the charge balancing TFSI- counterion in the solid state. The electrical conductivity and microstructural changes in P3HT film were consistent with the doping levels expected based on the radical cation fraction in the polymeric dopant. This redox-active PIL allows facile charge generation and broadens the choice of p-type dopants for semiconducting polymers.
   Interfacial doping of conjugated polymers is enabled by sequentially casting phenothiazine-based redox-active polymeric ionic liquids with TFSI- counterions.

AB PurposeThe ability to use laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) to print parts with tailored surface topography could reduce the need for costly post-processing. However, characterizing the as-built surface topography as a function of process parameters is crucial to establishing linkages between process parameters and surface topography and is currently not well understood. The purpose of this study is to measure the effect of different LPBF process parameters on the as-built surface topography of Inconel 718 parts.Design/methodology/approachInconel 718 truncheon specimens with different process parameters, including single- and double contour laser pass, laser power, laser scan speed, build orientation and characterize their as-built surface topography using deterministic and areal surface topography parameters are printed. The effect of both individual process parameters, as well as their interactions, on the as-built surface topography are evaluated and linked to the underlying physics, informed by surface topography data.FindingsDeterministic surface topography parameters are more suitable than areal surface topography parameters to characterize the distinct features of the as-built surfaces that result from LPBF. The as-built surface topography is strongly dependent on the built orientation and is dominated by the staircase effect for shallow orientations and partially fused metal powder particles for steep orientations. Laser power and laser scan speed have a combined effect on the as-built surface topography, even when maintaining constant laser energy density.Originality/valueThis work addresses two knowledge gaps. (i) It introduces deterministic instead of areal surface topography parameters to unambiguously characterize the as-built LPBF surfaces. (ii) It provides a methodical study of the as-built surface topography as a function of individual LPBF process parameters and their interaction effects.

AB Academia in the United States continues to grapple with its longstanding history of racial discrimination and its active perpetuation of racial disparities. To this end, universities and academic societies must grow in ways that reduce racial minoritization and foster racial equity. What are the effective and long-lasting approaches we as academics should prioritize to promote racial equity in our academic communities? To address this, the authors held a diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) panel during the Society for Behavioral Neuroendocrinology 2022 annual meeting, and in the following commentary synthesize the panelists' recommendations for fostering racial equity in the US academic community.

AB 1D charge transport offers great insight into strongly correlated physics, such as Luttinger liquids, electronic instabilities, and superconductivity. Although 1D charge transport is observed in nanomaterials and quantum wires, examples in bulk crystalline solids remain elusive. In this work, it is demonstrated that spin-orbit coupling (SOC) can act as a mechanism to induce quasi-1D charge transport in the Ln(3)MPn(5) (Ln = lanthanide; M = transition metal; Pn = Pnictide) family. From three example compounds, La3ZrSb5, La3ZrBi5, and Sm3ZrBi5, density functional theory calculations with SOC included show a quasi-1D Fermi surface in the bismuthide compounds, but an anisotropic 3D Fermi surface in the antimonide structure. By performing anisotropic charge transport measurements on La3ZrSb5, La3ZrBi5, and Sm3ZrBi5, it is demonstrated that SOC starkly affects their anisotropic resistivity ratios (ARR) at low temperatures, with an ARR of approximate to 4 in the antimonide compared to approximate to 9.5 and approximate to 22 (approximate to 32 after magnetic ordering) in La3ZrBi5 and Sm3ZrBi5, respectively. This report demonstrates the utility of spin-orbit coupling to induce quasi-low-dimensional Fermi surfaces in anisotropic crystal structures, and provides a template for examining other systems.

AB By combining an external display operating at 360 frames per second with an adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscope (AOSLO) for human foveal imaging, we demonstrate color stimulus delivery at high spatial and temporal resolution in AOSLO psychophysics experiments. A custom pupil relay enables viewing of the stimulus through a 3-mm effective pupil diameter and provides refractive error correction from -8 to +4 diopters. Performance of the assembled and aligned pupil relay was validated by measuring the wavefront error across the field of view and correction range, and the as-built Strehl ratio was 0.64 or better. High-acuity stimuli were rendered on the external display and imaged through the pupil relay to demonstrate that spatial frequencies up to 54 cycles per degree, corresponding to 20/11 visual acuity, are resolved. The completed external display was then used to render fixation markers across the field of view of the monitor, and a continuous retinal montage spanning 9.4 by 5.4 degrees of visual angle was acquired with the AOSLO. We conducted eye-tracking experiments during free-viewing and high-acuity tasks with polychromatic images presented on the external display. Sub-arcminute eye position uncertainty was achieved over a 1.5 by 1.5-degree trackable range, enabling precise localization of the line of sight on the stimulus while simultaneously imaging the fine structure of the human central fovea. This high refresh rate display overcomes the temporal, spectral, and field of view limitations of AOSLO-based stimulus presentation, enabling natural monocular viewing of stimuli in psychophysics experiments conducted with AOSLO.

AB In this article, a distributed neural network modeling framework including a novel neural hybrid system model is proposed for enhancing the scalability of neural network models in modeling dynamical systems. First, high-dimensional training data samples will be mapped to a low-dimensional feature space through the principal component analysis (PCA) featuring process. Following that, the feature space is bisected into multiple partitions based on the variation of the Shannon entropy under the maximum entropy (ME) bisecting process. The behavior of subsystems in the prespecified state space partitions will then be approximated using a group of shallow neural networks (SNNs) known as extreme learning machines (ELMs), and then it can further simplify the model by merging the redundant lattices based on their training error performance. The proposed modeling framework can handle high-dimensional dynamical system modeling problems with the advantages of reducing model complexity and improving model performance in training and verification. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modeling framework, examples of modeling the LASA dataset and an industrial robot are presented.

AB Hypothesis generation (HG) is a fundamental problem in biomedical text mining that uncovers plausible implicit links (B terms) between two disjoint concepts of interest (A and C terms). Over the past decade, many HG approaches based on distributional statistics, graph-theoretic measures, and supervised machine learning methods have been proposed. Despite significant advances made, the existing approaches have two major limitations. First, they mainly focus on enumerating hypotheses and often neglect to rank them in a semantically meaningful way. This leads to wasted time and resources as researchers may focus on hypotheses that are ultimately not supported by experimental evidence. Second, the existing approaches are designed to rank hypotheses with only one intermediate or evidence term (referred as simple hypotheses), and thus are unable to handle hypotheses with multiple intermediate terms (referred as complex hypotheses). This is limiting because recent research has shown that the complex hypotheses could be of greater practical value than simple ones, especially in the early stages of scientific discovery.
   To address these issues, we propose a new HG ranking approach that leverages upon the expressive power of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) coupled with a domain-knowledge guided Noise-Contrastive Estimation (NCE) strategy to effectively rank both simple and complex biomedical hypotheses. Specifically, the message passing capabilities of GNN allows our approach to capture the rich interactions between biomedical entities and succinctly handle the complex hypotheses with variable intermediate terms. Moreover, the proposed domain knowledge guided NCE strategy enables the ranking of complex hypotheses based on their coherence with the established biomedical knowledge. Extensive experiment results on five recognized biomedical datasets show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms the existing baselines and prioritizes hypotheses worthy of potential clinical trials.

AB As years pass, smartphones are becoming a larger part of daily lives, causing users to interact with them more than ever. There are moments, however, when it becomes difficult for the user to operate their device directly. Currently, a user can either touch their devices for direct interaction, or use voice commands for simpler tasks. Although these two methods are very capable means of interacting with the devices, they have their limitations. Touching a physical device is not always practical, while voice commands become ineffective in loud environments. A good example would be if the user is washing dishes in a noisy environment, where neither physical control nor voice commands are convenient. Existing systems of smartphone CSI gesture recognition rely on manual feature extraction which could be hard to implement as gestures grow in number and complexity. We study the feasibility of using lightweight image classification models with minimal preprocessing by implementing and testing the performance of such an architecture. We collect data for five gestures from three setups and two phones, on which our system is able to obtain 90.0% accuracy. Additionally, we investigate the impact of different people, distances, and phones on the system's performance.

AB At present, quantum computing is in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, marked by small qubit counts and high levels of noise and errors. Building a quantum computer with sufficient size and low error rates remains a challenge. In many promising quantum hardware architectures, the state of the physical qubits is controlled by pulse signals. In this paper, we will explore pulse-level control of quantum gates. Unlike the usual gate-level control, the pulse-level control provides increased flexibility and reduced latency. One direct application of pulse-level control is Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQA). The inherent properties of VQA allow us to disregard the gate-based evolution process and concentrate on the final target loss function. From the perspective of pulse-level control, we can generate a sequence of pulse-based gates to rotate the quantum state directly to the desired destination. In this study, we demonstrate an application of pulse-level VQA in estimating the ground state energy of molecular hydrogen. Our experiment is conducted using Quanlse which specializes in pulse-level control of quantum gates. The experimental results reveal a rapid convergence rate of optimization iterations, and the control pulses for each pulse-based gate is also displayed. These results highlight the considerable potential of pulse-level control techniques in practical applications.

AB Nitrate is a significant contaminant in Polar snow. Its photolysis in environmental sunlight generates reactive nitrogen, which impacts the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere, influencing the fate and lifetimes of pollutants. The photolysis of nitrate can produce either NO2 or NO2-, with recent experiments suggesting that the process is accelerated at the air-ice interface compared to the bulk solution. In this study, we employed a multiscale modeling approach to investigate the enhanced photoreactivity of nitrate at the ice surface in the presence of two different cations. We characterized the solvation shell of NO3- and explored its pairing with cations in water and ice using ab initio molecular dynamics and enhanced sampling. Molecular trajectories were used to calculate light absorption spectra at different solvation conditions and finite temperature. Our analysis revealed that the pairing of nitrate with cations may alter the molar absorption coefficient of nitrate at the air-ice interface affecting the rate of photolysis observed in experiments of ammonium nitrate deposited on snow.

AB The Precordillera of western Argentina displays a complex pre-Andean stratigraphic record related to Paleozoic convergence along the SW margin of Gondwana. Sedimentologic and U-Pb detrital zircon geochronological results for the Silurian Rinconada Formation and Carboniferous Jejenes Formation of the eastern Precordillera provide insight into sediment provenance, drainage reorganization, and climatic/tectonic interactions during Paleozoic deformation and glaciation. Measured sections and lithofacies analyses indicate sediment gravity flow and mass-transport deposition in a Silurian submarine fan during shortening in the adjacent Famatinian orogenic belt. This foreland basin was deformed during the Late Devonian Chanic orogeny, prior to glacial incision of remnant topography during the Late Paleozoic Ice Age. Analyses of unconformities, cross-cutting relationships, and lithofacies within a Carboniferous paleovalley (Quebrada Grande, Sierra Chica de Zonda) indicate four facies associations (fjord-head delta, distal fjord, fan delta, and subglacial fan) within a fjord setting governed by glacial advance and retreat. U-Pb results for Carboniferous sandstones (7 samples, 840 analyses) indicate derivation from Western Pampean basement with progressive drainage expansion to include the Famatinian magmatic arc and Eastern Sierras Pampeanas. Evolution from a Silurian marine foreland basin to an isolated Carboniferous fjord reflects major orogenic and climatic transitions in SW Gondwana. Ordovician-Silurian (Famatinian) and Late Devonian (Chanic) shortening generated topography that was subsequently beveled by glacial erosion during the Carboniferous. We suggest that Paleozoic deformation related to subduction and terrane collision helped drive changes in sediment dispersal and basin configuration, while climate changes during regional glaciation regulated erosion/deposition and the spatial extent of sediment accommodation.

AB SrTiO3 is an incipient ferroelectric and an exceptionally dilute superconductor with a domelike dependence on carrier concentration. Stabilization of a polar phase through chemical substitution or strain significantly enhances the superconducting critical temperature, suggesting a possible connection between the polar instability and unconventional Cooper pairing. To investigate the effects of doping on the polar order in SrTiO3, we develop a simplified free-energy model which includes only the degrees of freedom necessary to capture the relevant physics of a doped, biaxially compressively strained system. We simulate the polar and antiferrodistortive thermal phase transitions using Monte Carlo methods for different doping levels and comment on the doping dependence of the transition temperatures and the formation of polar nanodomains. In addition, the temperaturedependent phonon spectral function is calculated using Langevin simulations to investigate the lattice dynamics of the doped system. We also examine the effects of doping on the electronic structure within the polar phase, including the density of states and band splitting. Finally, we compute the polarization dependence of the Rashba parameter and the doping dependence of the Midgal ratio, and place our results in the broader context of proposed pairing mechanisms.

AB Using a novel dataset of 590M messages by 21M users, we present the first large-scale examination of the behavior of likely Bernie supporters on Twitter during the 2020 U.S. Democratic primaries and presidential election. We use these data to dispel empirically the notion of a unified, stereotypical Bernie supporter (e.g., the "Bernie Bro"). Instead, our work uncovers significant variation in the identities and ideologies of Bernie supporters who were active on Twitter. Our work makes three contributions to the literature on social media and social movements. Methodologically, we present a novel mixed methods approach to surface identity and ideological variation within a movement via use of patterns in who retweets whom (i.e. who retweets which other users) and who retweets what (i.e. who retweets which specific tweets). Substantively, documentation of these variations challenges a trend in the social movement literature to assume actors within a particular movement are unified in their ideology, identity, and values.

TI A global gridded dataset for cloud vertical structure from combined

SO EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA

DT Article
ID A-TRAIN; LIDAR; MISSION; PRODUCT; VIEW
AB The vertical structure of clouds has a profound effect on the global energy budget, the global circulation, and the atmospheric hydrological cycle. The CloudSat and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) missions have taken complementary, colocated observations of cloud vertical structure for over a decade. However, no globally gridded dataset is available to the public for the full length of this unique combined data record. Here we present the 3S-GEOPROF-COMB product (Bertrand et al. 2023, 10.5281/zenodo.8057791), a globally gridded (level 3S) community data product summarizing geometrical profiles (GEOPROF) of hydrometeor occurrence from combined (COMB) CloudSat and CALIPSO data. Our product is calculated from the latest release (R05) of per-orbit (level-2) combined cloud mask profiles. We process a set of cloud cover, vertical cloud fraction, and sampling variables at 2.5, 5, and 10(degrees) spatial resolutions and monthly and seasonal temporal resolutions. We address the 2011 reduction in CloudSat data collection with Daylight-Only Operations (DO-Op) mode by subsampling pre-2011 data to mimic DO-Op collection patterns, thereby allowing users to evaluate the impact of the reduced sampling on their analyses. We evaluate our data product against CloudSat-only and CALIPSO-only global-gridded data products as well as four comparable surface-based sites, underscoring the added value of the combined product. Interest in the product is anticipated for the study of cloud processes, cloud-climate interactions, and as a candidate baseline climate data record for comparison to follow-up satellite missions, among other uses.

AB Positive outcomes from undergraduate research experiences (UREs) have resulted in calls to broaden and diversify participation in research. However, we have little understanding of what demographics are reported and considered in the analyses of student outcomes from UREs. Without this information, it is impossible to assess whether participation in UREs has been diversified and how outcomes may vary by participant identity. Through a comprehensive literature search, we systematically identified 147 peer-reviewed research articles on student participation in UREs in the natural sciences, published between 2014 and 2020. We coded each paper to document which student demographic variables are reported and considered in analyses. The majority (88%) of articles on UREs reported at least one demographic variable and 62% incorporate demographics into their analyses, but demographics beyond gender and race/ethnicity were infrequently considered. Articles on independent research apprenticeships included demographics in their analyses more frequently than studies on course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs). Trends in reporting and analyzing demographics did not change from 2014 to 2020. Future efforts to collect these data will help assess whether goals to diversify UREs are being met and inform how to design UREs to meet the needs of diverse student groups.

AB We give a simple proof of the matrix Spencer conjecture up to poly-logarithmic rank: given symmetric d x d matrices A(1),..., A(n) each with parallel to A(i)parallel to(op) <= 1 and rank at most n/log(3) n, one can efficiently find +/- 1 signs x(1),..., x(n) such that their signed sum has spectral norm. parallel to Sigma(n)(i=1) xiAi parallel to(op) = O(root n). This result also implies a logn Omega(log logn) qubit lower bound for quantum random access codes encoding n classical bits with advantage >> 1/root n. Our proof uses the recent refinement of the non-commutative Khintchine inequality in [Bandeira, Boedihardjo, van Handel, 2021] for random matrices with correlated Gaussian entries.

AB The presence of magnetic fields in the late inspiral of black hole-neutron star binaries could lead to potentially detectable electromagnetic precursor transients. Using general-relativistic force-free electrodynamics simulations, we investigate premerger interactions of the common magnetosphere of black hole-neutron star systems. We demonstrate that these systems can feature copious electromagnetic flaring activity, which we find depends on the magnetic field orientation but not on black hole spin. Due to interactions with the surrounding magnetosphere, these flares could lead to fast-radio-burst-like transients and X-ray emission, with L-EM less than or similar to 10(41)(B-*/10(12) G)(2) erg s(-1) as an upper bound on the luminosity, where B-* is the magnetic field strength on the surface of the neutron star.

AB Purpose of ReviewBioengineering of functional cardiac tissue composed of primary cardiomyocytes has great potential for myocardial regeneration and in vitro tissue modeling. 3D bioprinting was developed to create cardiac tissue in hydrogels that can mimic the structural, physiological, and functional features of native myocardium. Through a detailed review of the 3D printing technologies and bioink materials used in the creation of a heart tissue, this article discusses the potential of engineered heart tissues in biomedical applications.Recent FindingsIn this review, we discussed the recent progress in 3D bioprinting strategies for cardiac tissue engineering, including bioink and 3D bioprinting methods as well as examples of engineered cardiac tissue such as in vitro cardiac models and vascular channels.3D printing is a powerful tool for creating in vitro cardiac tissues that are structurally and functionally similar to real tissues. The use of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CM) enables the generation of patient-specific tissues. These tissues have the potential to be used for regenerative therapies, disease modeling, and drug testing.

AB Ambient classroom sensing systems offer a scalable and non-intrusive way to find connections between instructor actions and student behaviors, creating data that can improve teaching and learning. While these systems effectively provide aggregate data, getting reliable individual student-level information is difficult due to occlusion or movements. Individual data can help in understanding equitable student participation, but it requires identifiable data or individual instrumentation. We propose ClassID, a data attribution method for within a class session and across multiple sessions of a course without these constraints. For within-session, our approach assigns unique identifiers to 98% of students with 95% accuracy. It significantly reduces multiple ID assignments compared to the baseline approach (3 vs. 167) based on our testing on data from 15 classroom sessions. For across-session attributions, our approach, combined with student attendance, shows higher precision than the state-of-the-art approach (85% vs. 44%) on three courses. Finally, we present a set of four use cases to demonstrate how individual behavior attribution can enable a rich set of learning analytics, which is not possible with aggregate data alone.

ID WORK-FUNCTION REDUCTION
AB In2O3, an n-type semiconducting transparent transition metal oxide, possesses a surface electron accumulation layer (SEAL) resulting from downward surface band bending due to the presence of ubiquitous oxygen vacancies. Upon annealing In2O3 in ultrahigh vacuum or in the presence of oxygen, the SEAL can be enhanced or depleted, as governed by the resulting density of oxygen vacancies at the surface. In this work, an alternative route to tune the SEAL by adsorption of strong molecular electron donors (specifically here ruthenium pentamethylcyclopentadienyl mesitylene dimer, [RuCp*mes](2)) and acceptors (here 2,2 '-(1,3,4,5,7,8-hexafluoro-2,6-naphthalene-diylidene)bis-propanedinitrile, F(6)TCNNQ) is demonstrated. Starting from an electron-depleted In2O3 surface after annealing in oxygen, the deposition of [RuCp*mes](2) restores the accumulation layer as a result of electron transfer from the donor molecules to In2O3, as evidenced by the observation of (partially) filled conduction sub-bands near the Fermi level via angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, indicating the formation of a 2D electron gas due to the SEAL. In contrast, when F(6)TCNNQ is deposited on a surface annealed without oxygen, the electron accumulation layer vanishes and an upward band bending is generated at the In2O3 surface due to electron depletion by the acceptor molecules. Hence, further opportunities to expand the application of In2O3 in electronic devices are revealed.

AB Limited access to food stores is often linked to higher health risks and lower community resilience. Socially vulnerable populations experience persistent disparities in equitable food store access. However, little research has been done to examine how people's access to food stores is affected by natural disasters. Previous studies mainly focus on examining potential access using the travel distance to the nearest food store, which often falls short of capturing the actual access of people. Therefore, to fill this gap, this paper incorporates human mobility patterns into the measure of actual access, leveraging large-scale mobile phone data. Specifically, we propose a novel enhanced two-step floating catchment area method with travel preferences (E2SFCA-TP) to measure accessibility, which extends the traditional E2SFCA model by integrating actual human mobility behaviors. We then analyze people's actual access to grocery and convenience stores across both space and time under the devastating winter storm Uri in Harris County, Texas. Our results highlight the value of using human mobility patterns to better reflect people's actual access behaviors. The proposed E2SFCA-TP measure is more capable of capturing mobility variations in people's access, compared with the traditional E2SFCA measure. This paper provides insights into food store access across space and time, which could aid decision making in resource allocation to enhance accessibility and mitigate the risk of food insecurity in underserved areas.

AB Cr 2 Te 3 is a ferromagnetic, quasi -two-dimensional layered material with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, strong spin -orbit coupling, and nontrivial band topology. The nontrivial topology results in an intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) that switches sign under filling and biaxial strain. Thin films can exhibit half-metallicity. Using density -functional theory combined with maximally localized Wannier functions, we reveal the physical origins of the sensitivity of the sign of the AHC to strain and filling, and we determine the effect of surface termination on the half-metallicity. We find that thin films terminated on the Te layers are the most energetically stable, but only the thin films terminated on both sides with the partially occupied Cr layers are half metals. In bulk Cr 2 Te 3 , the sensitivity of the sign of the AHC to strain and filling results from the complex Fermi surface comprised of three bands. Filling of local minima and bands near anticrossings alters the local Berry curvature, consistent with the negative -to -positive switching of the AHC. Similarly, strain depopulates a local minimum, shifts a degenerate point closer to the Fermi energy, and causes two spin -orbit split bands to reverse their order. These findings provide a physical understanding of the evolution of the Berry phase, AHC, and half-metallicity in Cr 2 Te 3 .

AB Purpose: The purpose of this study is to develop an accurate deep learning model capable of Inferior Vena Cava (IVC) filter segmentation from CT scans. The study does a comparative assessment of the impact of Residual Networks (ResNets) complemented with reduced convolutional layer depth and also analyzes the impact of using vision transformer architectures without performance degradation. Materials and Methods: This experimental retrospective study on 84 CT scans consisting of 54618 slices involves design, implementation, and evaluation of segmentation algorithm which can be used to generate a clinical report for the presence of IVC filters on abdominal CT scans performed for any reason. Several variants of patch-based 3D-Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the Swin UNet Transformer (Swin-UNETR) are used to retrieve the signature of IVC filters. The Dice Score is used as a metric to compare the performance of the segmentation models. Results: Model trained on UNet variant using four ResNet layers showed a higher segmentation performance achieving median Dice = 0.92 [Interquartile range(IQR): 0.85, 0.93] compared to the plain UNet model with four layers having median Dice = 0.89 [IQR: 0.83, 0.92]. Segmentation results from ResNet with two layers achieved a median Dice = 0.93 [IQR: 0.87, 0.94] which was higher than the plain UNet model with two layers at median Dice = 0.87 [IQR: 0.77, 0.90]. Models trained using SWIN-based transformers performed significantly better in both training and validation datasets compared to the four CNN variants. The validation median Dice was highest in 4 layer Swin UNETR at 0.88 followed by 2 layer Swin UNETR at 0.85. Conclusion: Utilization of vision based transformer Swin-UNETR results in segmentation output with both low bias and variance thereby solving a real-world problem within healthcare for advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) image processing and recognition. The Swin UNETR will reduce the time spent manually tracking IVC filters by centralizing within the electronic health record. Link to GitHub repository.

TI BRIDGES: Real world data, assignments and visualizations to engage and

   Programming assignments
AB BRIDGES is a software framework for creating engaging assignments for required courses such as data structures and algorithms. It provides students with a simplified API that populates their own data structure implementations with live and real-world data, and provides the ability for students to easily visualize the data structures they create as part of routine classroom exercises. The objective is to use the infrastructure to promote a better understanding of the data structure and its underlying algorithms. This report describes the BRIDGES infrastructure and provides evaluation data collected over the first five years of the project. In the first 2 years, as we were developing the BRIDGES projects, our focus was on gathering data to assess whether the addition of the BRIDGES exercises had an effect on student retention of core concepts in data structures; and throughout the 5-year duration of the project, student interest and faculty feedback were collected online and anonymously. A mixed method design was used to evaluate the project impact. A quasiexperimental design compared student cohorts who were enrolled in comparable course sections that used BRIDGES with those that did not. Qualitative and quantitative measures were developed and used together with course grades and grade point averages. Interest and relevance in BRIDGES programming assignments was assessed with additional survey data from students and instructors. Results showed that students involved in BRIDGES projects demonstrated larger gains in knowledge of data structures compared to students enrolled in comparable course sections, as well as long-term benefits in their performance in four follow-on required courses. Survey responses indicated that some investment of time was needed to use BRIDGES, but the extra efforts were associated with several notable outcomes. Students and instructors had positive perceptions of the value of engaging in BRIDGES projects. BRIDGES can become a tool to get students more engaged in critical foundational courses, demonstrating relevance and context to today's computational challenges.

TI Resonant phonons: Localization in a structurally ordered crystal
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
LA English
DT Article
ID LOW THERMAL-CONDUCTIVITY; ANDERSON LOCALIZATION; TRANSPORT; REDUCTION;
   SILICON; WAVES
AB Phonon localization is a phenomenon that influences numerous material properties in condensed matter physics. Anderson localization brings rise to localized atomic-scale phonon interferences in disordered lattices with an influence limited to high-frequency phonons having wavelengths comparable to the size of a randomly perturbed unit cell. Here we computationally expose a form of phonon localization induced by augmenting a crystalline material with intrinsic phonon nanoresonators with feature sizes that can be smaller or larger than the phonon wavelengths but must be relatively small compared to the phonon mean free paths. This mechanism is deterministic and takes place within numerous discrete narrow-frequency bands spread throughout the full spectrum with central frequencies controlled by design. For demonstration, we run molecular dynamics simulations of all-silicon nanopillared membranes at room temperature and apply to the underlying thermalized environment narrowband wave packets as an excitation at precisely the frequencies where resonant hybridizations are evident in the anharmonic phonon band structure. Upon comparison to other frequency ranges where the nanostructure does not exhibit local resonances, significant intrinsic spatial phonon localization along the direction of transport is explicitly observed. Furthermore, the energy exchange with external sources is minimized at the resonant frequencies. We conclude by making a direct comparison with Anderson localization highlighting the superiority of the resonant phonons across both sides of the interference frequency limit.

AB In this article, we study the performance of the gradient play algorithm for stochastic games (SGs), where each agent tries to maximize its own total discounted reward by making decisions independently based on current state information, which is shared between agents. Policies are directly parameterized by the probability of choosing a certain action at a given state. We show that Nash equilibria (NEs) and first-order stationary policies are equivalent in this setting, and give a local convergence rate around strict NEs. Furthermore, for a subclass of SGs called Markov potential games (which includes the setting with identical rewards as an important special case), we design a sample-based reinforcement learning algorithm and give a nonasymptotic global convergence rate analysis for both exact gradient play and our sample-based learning algorithm. Our result shows that the number of iterations to reach an epsilon-NE scales linearly, instead of exponentially, with the number of agents. Local geometry and local stability are also considered, where we prove that strict NEs are local maxima of the total potential function and fully mixed NEs are saddle points.

AB Marine teleosts experience ion gain and water loss in their natural habitats. Among other tissues, the urinary bladder epithelium of marine fishes has been shown to actively transport ions to facilitate water absorption. However, transport properties of the urinary bladder epithelium of marine fishes and its plasticity in altered ambient salinities is relatively under-investigated. We describe urinary bladder epithelium electrophysiology, water flux, and expressions of ion transporters in urinary bladder tissue of Gulf toadfish (Opsanus beta) acclimated to either 35 ppt or 60 ppt seawater. Water absorption in bladder sac preparations increased similar to 350% upon acclimation to 60 ppt. Increases in water transport coincided with a significant similar to 137% increase in urinary bladder tissue mucosal-to-serosal short circuit current (I-sc) and a similar to 56% decrease in tissue membrane resistance. Collectively, these metrics indicate that an active electrogenic system facilitates water absorption via Na+ (and Cl-) transport in urinary bladder tissue. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of urinary bladder tissue I-sc and expression of a suite of ion transporters and channels previously unidentified in this tissue provide mechanistic insights into the transport processes responsible for water flux. Analysis of water transport to overall Gulf toadfish water balance reveals a modest water conservation role for the urinary bladder of similar to 0.5% of total water absorption in 35 ppt and 1.9% in 60 ppt acclimated toadfish. These results emphasize that electrogenic ion transport facilitates water-absorptive properties of the urinary bladder in Gulf toadfish-a process that is regulated to facilitate water homeostasis. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Novel experiments showcasing increased urinary bladder water absorption, ion transport, and altered channel/transporter expression in a marine fish acclimated to high salinities. Our results provide additional and noteworthy mechanistic insight into the ionoregulatory processes controlling water transport at the level of the urinary bladder in marine teleosts. Experimental outcomes are applied to whole organism-level water transport values, and the relative importance of marine teleost urinary bladder function to overall organism water conservatory measures is discussed.

AB This study investigates the electrical properties of Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)-PbTiO3 (PMN-PT) single crystals subjected to corona poling (CorP) compared to direct current poling (DCP) and alternating current poling (ACP) methods. The results revealed the superiority of CorP in terms of polarization retention and softening. The corona-poled sample demonstrated a higher depolarization temperature (T-d similar to 100 celcius) than DCP or ACP methods (T-d similar to 90 celcius), indicating improved polarization stability at elevated temperatures. Furthermore, lowering of the coercive field (EC) in CorP samples suggests CorP makes the materials electrically softer. These advantages stem from the noncontact nature of the CorP method, which minimizes the risk of localized dielectric breakdown, and ensures a uniform electric field distribution. This work sheds a light on the potential of CorP as a promising technique for enhancing the electrical performance of materials in piezoelectric applications.

AB Ensuring safe, secure, and trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI), particularly within safety-critical systems like autonomous cyber-physical stems (CPS), is of paramount importance and of crucial urgency for dependability research. One approach to establishing such desiderata of AI is through formal verification, particularly in machine learning (ML) components like neural networks, to establish they meet certain formal specifications. The Neural Network Verification (NNV) software tool implements automated formal methods for this purpose, specifically reachability analysis, and this interactive tutorial will demonstrate these to formally verify specifications in neural networks, as well as in closed-loop CPS. The tutorial begins with a lecture on the emerging research area of neural network verification, followed by interactive demos of these methods implemented in NNV. Examples will be shown from the security, medicine, and CPS domains.

ID PULSES
AB We report a systematic investigation into the processes behind a near hundred-fold enhanced second harmonic wave generated from a laser-induced air plasma, by exam-ining the temporal dynamics of the frequency conversion processes, and the polarization of the emitted second har-monic beam. Contrary to typical nonlinear optical processes, the enhanced second harmonic generation efficiency is only observed within a sub-picosecond time window and found to be nearly constant across fundamental pulse durations span-ning from 0.1 ps to over 2 ps. We further demonstrate that with the adopted orthogonal pump-probe configuration, the polarization of the second harmonic field exhibits a complex dependence on the polarization of both input fundamental beams, contrasting with most of the previous experiments with a single-beam geometry.& COPY; 2023 Optica Publishing Group

AB The nonrelativistic spin-splitting (NRSS) of electronic bands in "altermagnets" has sparked renewed interest in antiferromagnets (AFMs) that have no net magnetization. However, altermagnets with collinear and compensated magnetism are not the only type of NRSS AFMs. In this Letter, we identify the symmetry conditions and characteristic signatures of a distinct group of NRSS AFMs that go beyond the description of altermagnets. These compounds exhibit a broken spin degeneracy among the spin-polarized bands at the Gamma point in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. We use density functional theory calculations to validate these models in ternary magnetic nitrides, specifically MnXN2 (X 1 / 4 Si, Ge, Sn), and their cation ordered variants. By removing the previous spin degenerate constraint at Gamma, these compounds may facilitate the generation of spin currents without cancellation arising from the alternating spin polarizations. Our findings expand the scope of NRSS eligible materials.

TI Assessment of the free shear boundary condition in a capillary meniscus
   via molecular dynamics
SO PHYSICS OF FLUIDS
LA English
DT Article
ID SIMULATIONS; SURFACES; SLIP
AB Computational fluid dynamics models often employ the free shear boundary condition at free surfaces, a result from the continuity of the stress and the large viscosity contrast at liquid-gas interfaces. This study leverages nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the validity of the free shear boundary condition on the exposed surface of a liquid meniscus at the nanoscale. The primary objective is elucidating the fundamental mechanisms and behavior of fluid interactions within a capillary meniscus formed between two carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in shear-driven flow. Shear-driven flow simulations were conducted by varying the velocity of a solid slab to induce different shear rates in the adjacent water molecules. The results demonstrate, for the first time, negligible shear at the free surface, supporting the free shear assumption from the nanoscale point of view. A force balance analysis reveals that capillary and surface tension forces dominate within the meniscus, dictating its shape and stability. Meniscus deformation was observed and primarily attributed to interatomic interactions between water molecules and CNTs, driven by a combination of short-range repulsive forces and van der Waals attractions. The minimal contribution from shear forces suggests that interatomic forces, rather than applied shear stress, are the primary drivers of the meniscus deformation. These findings offer valuable insights into fluid behavior and a sound fundamental analysis of the free shear boundary condition at the nanoscale.

AB Mathematics is a core component of cognition. Unfortunately, most young children and teachers cannot access research-based early childhood mathematics resources. Building on a quarter-century of research, we are developing and evaluating an innovative, integrated, intelligent, and interactive system of technologies based on empirically validated learning trajectories that provide the best personal and digital tools for assessing and supporting children's mathematics learning. This article reviews the research that guided us, then describes the design principles of the new project, justifying their selection using theory and research, and shares how the design principles helped address challenges in development. The goal is to provide teachers, caregivers, and children with high-quality resources to support early mathematics learning in the context of meaningful, motivating, challenging, and achievable experiences.

AB The concept of Terahertz Field-Induced Second Harmonic (TFISH) Generation is revisited to introduce a single-shot detection scheme based on third order nonlinearities. Focused specifically on the further development of THz plasma-based sources, we begin our research by reimagining the TFISH system to serve as a direct plasma diagnostic. In this work, an optical probe beam is used to mix directly with the strong ponderomotive current associated with laser-induced ionization. A four-wave mixing (FWM) process then generates a strong second-harmonic optical wave because of the mixing of the probe beam with the nonlinear current components oscillating at THz frequencies. The observed conversion efficiency is high enough that for the first time, the TFISH signal appears visible to the human eye. We perform spectral, spatial, and temporal analysis on the detected second-harmonic frequency and show its direct relationship to the nonlinear current. Further, a method to detect incoherent and coherent THz inside plasma filaments is devised using spatio-temporal couplings. The single-shot detection configurations are theoretically described using a combination of expanded FWM models with Kostenbauder and Gaussian Q-matrices. We show that the retrieved temporal traces for THz radiation from single- and two-color laser-induced air-plasma sources match theoretical descriptions very well. High temporal resolution is shown with a detection bandwidth limited only by the spatial extent of the probe laser beam. Large detection bandwidth and temporal characterization is shown for THz radiation confined to under-dense plasma filaments induced by < 100 fs lasers below the relativistic intensity limit.

   ADHESION; IONS
AB Contact electrification in a gas medium is usually followed by partial surface charge dissipation caused by dielectric breakdown of the gas triggered during separation of the surfaces. It is widely assumed that such discharge obeys the classical Paschen's law, which describes the general dependence of the breakdown voltage on the product of gas pressure and gap distance. However, quantification of this relationship in contact electrification involving insulators is impeded by challenges in nondestructive in situ measurement of the gap voltage. The present work implements an electrode-free strategy for capturing discrete discharge events by monitoring the gap voltage via Coulomb force, providing experimental evidence of Paschen curves governing nitrogen breakdown in silicone-acrylic and copper-nylon contact electrification. It offers an alternative approach for characterizing either the ionization energies of gases or the secondary-electron-emission properties of surfaces without the requirement of a power supply, which can potentially benefit applications ranging from the design of insulative materials to the development of triboelectric sensors and generators.
   Contact electrification triggers gas breakdown. Using Coulomb force to estimate voltage, this work provides experimental evidence for the Paschen curves that govern such discharge.

TI Pearl-Necklace to Unimolecular Micelle Formation by Heterograft
   Bottlebrush Polymers in Solution
SO MACROMOLECULES
LA English

ID FORCE-FIELD; BRUSH; COPOLYMERS; SIMULATION; LENGTH
AB Bottlebrush polymers (BBPs) have attracted considerable attention due to their unique properties and a variety of applications. Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate and compare the structural properties of cyclic and linear poly(vinyl alcohol)-graft-poly(ethylene oxide)/poly(ethylene) (PVA-g-PEO/PE) in aqueous solution as a function of hydrophobic side-chain fraction. The side chains of different chemical nature allow the bottlebrush polymer to self-organize into different unimolecular structures. We found that with an increasing polyethylene fraction or PE side-chain length, an amphiphilic BBP self-organizes first into a pearl-necklace structure, which contains several hydrophobic aggregates engulfed and separated by hydrophilic side chains followed by a dumbbell-like structure. When the separation between two neighboring PE side chains becomes less than half of a PE side-chain length (d sep < l PE/2), a spherical unimolecular micelle with a single hydrophobic core surrounded by hydrophilic corona forms. Linear heterograft BBPs exhibit a higher propensity for the pearl-necklace regime at lower PE fractions, while for the cyclic heterograft BBPs, the backbone curvature enhances formation of dumbbell-like structures and facilitates packing into a more compact core of unimolecular micelles at higher PE content. The shape anisotropy of linear heterograft BBPs systematically decreases with an increase of PE fraction as the shape changes from 1D worm-like to a 3D spherically symmetric unimolecular micelle, while for cyclic heterograft BBPs, the shape anisotropy increases, reaches a maximum, and decreases reflecting conformational changes from a planar 2D structure to 1D dumbbell to 3D spherical conformations, accordingly. Among the different conformations of heterograft BBPs in solution, a spherical unimolecular micelle with the smallest hydrophobic core exhibits minimal contacts with water and maximum protection by the hydrophilic corona. These results demonstrate that heterograft BBPs offer a variety of conformations controlled by the side-chain length and composition that can be exploited in different applications including encapsulation of hydrophobic moieties for therapeutic or imaging applications.

AB Polyimides (PIs), known for their thermal resistance, chemical stability, and mechanical properties, are often considered challenging materials to process, resulting in limited commercial availability of PIs for melt extrusion, injection molding, and fused filament fabrication (FFF). Currently, material and knowledge gaps prevent the ability to rapidly produce parts from PIs that can be used in high strength and elevated temperature applications. To address this, a novel, fully aromatic PI with thermotropic liquid crystalline properties (LCPI) is successfully synthesized. The synthesized LCPI exhibits better solvent tolerance and thermal stability than commercially available counterparts. The LC phase is confirmed by thermal analysis, wide angle X-ray scattering, and polarized optical microscopy. Rheological behavior clearly demonstrates that the LC phase reduces melt viscosity. These properties enable the LCPI to be processed into both drawn fibers and filaments for FFF, which is demonstrated alongside an injection molding process. The properties of the printed parts rivaled those made with Ultem 1000, exhibiting an average elastic modulus of 4.16 GPa. The injection molding process resulted in tensile moduli as high as 8.59 GPa and tensile strengths as high as 124.70 MPa. The LCPI polymer demonstrates the desired properties required for aerospace applications via melt processing techniques.

AB Spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking plays an important role in studying strongly correlated unconventional superconductors. When two superconducting gap functions with different symmetries compete, the relative phase channel (theta- equivalent to theta 1 - theta 2) exhibits an Ising-type Z2 symmetry due to the second order Josephson coupling, where theta 1,2 are the phases of two gap functions. In contrast, the U(1) symmetry in the channel of \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${\theta _ + } \equiv {{{\theta _1} + {\theta _2}} \over 2}$$\end{document} is intact. The phase locking, i.e., ordering of theta-, can take place in the phase fluctuation regime before the onset of superconductivity, i.e., when theta+ is disordered. If theta- is pinned at \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$ \pm {\pi \over 2}$$\end{document}, then time-reversal symmetry is broken in the normal state, otherwise, if theta- = 0, or, pi, rotational symmetry is broken, leading to a nematic normal state. In both cases, the order parameters possess a 4-fermion structure beyond the scope of mean-field theory, which can be viewed as a high order symmetry breaking. We employ an effective two-component XY-model assisted by a renormalization group analysis to address this problem. As a natural by-product, we also find the other interesting intermediate phase corresponds to ordering of theta+ but with theta- disordered. This is the quartetting, or, charge-4e, superconductivity, which occurs above the low temperature Z2-breaking charge-2e superconducting phase. Our results provide useful guidance for studying novel symmetry breaking phases in strongly correlated superconductors.

AB The Software-Defined Networking (SDN) concept allows network innovations by leveraging a centralized controller that commands the whole network. The controller manages the functionality of the entire network. In the event that the controller fails, the switches will attempt to continue to forward traffic based on the last set of entries in the forwarding table. Therefore, assuming an unstable network, no interruption can be expected. Consequently, when a controller fails due to an expiration time or capacity limitation for a forwarding table, the controller will not be able to handle newly arriving packets. This will result in the entire network going down. Because of vulnerabilities between the control plane and the data plane, Denial of Service (DoS) attacks often pose the greatest risk to SDN. The paper discusses a method to detect this attack before it leads to failure of the controller. The proposed combined anomaly detection method, which is called Entropy-KL-ML, uses entropy along with KL-divergence and ensemble learning to detect any uncertainty in incoming packets within time slots. KL-divergence and ML classifiers make the detection more accurate. We also present a new method for selecting features based on grouping the features that reduces the computational overhead of the controller. With an anomaly detection method in SDN, it is essential to provide a balance between overhead, accuracy, and processing time. Through a real-world data set and some anomaly detectors, we demonstrate that the Entropy-KL-ML method detects anomalies with greater accuracy and fewer overheads.

AB High-level synthesis (HLS) aims to raise the abstraction layer in hardware design, enabling the design of domain-specific accelerators (DSAs) targeted for field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) using C/C++ instead of hardware description languages (HDLs). Compiler directives in the form of pragmas play a crucial role in modifying the microarchitecture within the HLS framework. However, the number of possible microarchitectures grows exponentially with the number of pragmas. Moreover, the evaluation of each candidate design using the HLS tool consumes significant time, ranging from minutes to hours, leading to a slow optimization process. To accelerate this process, machine learning models have been used to predict design quality in milliseconds. However, existing open-source datasets for training such models are limited in terms of design complexity and available optimizations. In this paper, we present HLSYN, a new benchmark that addresses these limitations. It contains more complex programs with a wider range of optimization pragmas, making it a comprehensive dataset for training and evaluating design quality prediction models. The HLSYN benchmark consists of 42 unique programs/kernels, each of which has many different pragma configurations, resulting in over 42,000 labeled designs. We conduct an extensive comparison of state-of-the-art baselines to assess their effectiveness in predicting design quality. As an ongoing project, we anticipate expanding the HLSYN benchmark in terms of both quantity and variety of programs to further support the development of this field.

AB Many popular spatial transcriptomics techniques lack single-cell resolution. Instead, these methods measure the collective gene expression for each location from a mixture of cells, potentially containing multiple cell types. Here, we developed scResolve, a method for recovering single-cell expression profiles from spatial transcriptomics measurements at multi-cellular resolution. scResolve accurately restores expression profiles of individual cells at their locations, which is unattainable with cell type deconvolution. Applications of scResolve on human breast cancer data and human lung disease data demonstrate that scResolve enables cell-type-specific differential gene expression analysis between different tissue contexts and accurate identification of rare cell populations. The spatially resolved cellular-level expression profiles obtained through scResolve facilitate more flexible and precise spatial analysis that complements raw multi-cellular level analysis.

TI Large Eddy Simulation of Separated Flows on Unconventionally Coarse
   Grids
SO JOURNAL OF FLUIDS ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME
LA English
DT Article
AB We examine and benchmark the emerging idea of applying the large eddy simulation (LES) formalism to unconventionally coarse grids where Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) would be considered more appropriate at first glance. We distinguish this idea from very large eddy simulation and detached eddy simulation, which require switching between RANS and LES formalism. LES on RANS grid is appealing because first, it requires minimal changes to a production code; second, it is more cost-effective than LES; third, it converges to LES; and most importantly, it accurately predicts flows with separation. This work quantifies the benefit of LES on RANS-like grids as compared to RANS on the same grids. Three canonical cases are considered: periodic hill, backward-facing step, and jet in cross flow. We conduct direct numerical simulation (DNS), proper LES on LES grids, LES on RANS-quality grids, and RANS. We show that while the LES solutions on the RANS-quality grids are not grid converged, they are twice as accurate as the RANS on the same grids.

SO ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS

AB Aerosol jet printing is a technology particularly suited for additive manufacturing of functional microstructures, offering resolutions as high as 10 mu m, broad compatibility for electronic nanomaterials, and noncontact deposition, making it compelling for device prototyping and conformal printing. To adapt this method from thin film patterns to taller features, both ink rheology and drying kinetics require careful engineering. Printing in a solvent-rich, low-viscosity state commonly results in a puddle, with liquid-phase spreading and susceptibility to instabilities, whereas printing solvent-depleted aerosol results in a granular morphology with high overspray. Here, we demonstrate a strategy to mitigate this trade-off by tailoring the evolution of ink rheology during the process, using a graphene ink containing the nonsolvent glycerol as an exemplar. During droplet transport to the nozzle, evaporation of volatile primary solvents increases the glycerol concentration, resulting in gel formation. This switch in the ink rheology between the cartridge and substrate maintains the print resolution at high deposition rates. Moreover, multiple layers can be printed in rapid succession to build up high aspect ratio microstructures, as demonstrated by continuously printed cylindrical pillars with diameters on the order of similar to 100 mu m and aspect ratios as high as similar to 10. Finally, the efficacy of this ink formulation strategy for a CuO nanoparticle ink confirms the generalizability of this strategy for a broader scope of colloidal nanomaterial inks. In addition to its utility for microscale additive manufacturing of 2.5D structures, this strategy provides insights into higher deposition rate patterning to improve scalability and throughput of aerosol jet printing.

AB Study region: The Mississippi Alluvial Plain (MAP) in the United States (US). Study focus: Understanding local-scale groundwater use, a critical component of the water budget, is necessary for implementing sustainable water management practices. The MAP is one of the most productive agricultural regions in the US and extracts more than 11 km3/year for irrigation activities. Consequently, groundwater-level declines in the MAP region pose a substantial challenge to water sustainability, and hence, we need reliable groundwater pumping monitoring solutions to manage this resource appropriately. New hydrological insights for the region: We incorporate remote sensing datasets and machine learning to improve an existing lookup table-based model of groundwater use previously developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). Here, we employ Distributed Random Forests, an ensemble machine learning algorithm to predict annual and monthly groundwater use (2014-2020) throughout this region at 1-km resolution, using pumping data from existing flowmeters in the Mississippi Delta. Our model compares favorably with the existing USGS model, with higher R2 (0.51 compared to 0.42 in the previous model), and lower root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE)- 0.14 m and 0.09 m, respectively in our model, compared to 0.15 m and 0.1 m in the previous model. Therefore, this work advances our ability to predict groundwater use in regions with scarce or limited in-situ groundwater withdrawal data availability.

AB The 2012 Menlo Report was an effort in which a group of computer scientists, US government funders, and lawyers produced ethics guidelines for research in information and communications technology (ICT). Here we study Menlo as a case of what we call ethics governance in the making, finding that this process examines past controversies and enrols existing networks to connect the everyday practice of ethics with ethics as a form of governance. To create the Menlo Report, authors and funders relied on bricolage work with existing, available resources, which significantly shaped both the report's contents and impacts. Report authors were motivated by both forward- and backward-looking goals: enabling new data-sharing as well as addressing past controversies and their implications for the field's body of research. Authors also grappled with uncertainty about which ethical frameworks were appropriate and made the decision to classify much network data as human subjects data. Finally, the Menlo Report authors attempted to enrol multiple existing networks in governance through appeals to local research communities as well as taking steps towards federal rulemaking. The Menlo Report serves as a case study in how to study ethics governance in the making: with attention to resources, adaptation, and bricolage, and with a focus on both the uncertainties the process tries to repair, as well as the new uncertainties the process uncovers, which will become the site of future ethics work.

AB Glycerol, a byproduct of biodiesel, has moderate energy but high viscosity, making clean combustion challenging. Quickly evaporating fine fuel sprays mix well with air and burn cleanly and efficiently. Unlike conventional air-blast atomizers discharging a jet core/film, a newly developed swirl burst (SB) injector generates fine sprays at the injector's immediate exit, even for high-viscosity fuels, without preheating, using a unique two-phase atomization mechanism. It thus resulted in ultra-clean combustion for glycerol/methanol (G/M) blends, with complete combustion for G/M of 50/50 ratios by heat release rate (HRR). Lower combustion efficiencies were observed for G/M 60/40 and 70/30, representing crude glycerol. Hence, this study investigates the effect of premixed methane amount from 0-3 kW, and the effect of atomizing gas to liquid mass ratio (ALR) on the dual-fuel combustion efficiency of G/M 60/40-methane in a 7-kW lab-scale swirl-stabilized gas turbine combustor to facilitate crude glycerol use. Results show that more methane and increased ALR cause varying flame lift-off height, length, and gas product temperature. Regardless, mainly lean-premixed combustion, near-zero CO and NOx emissions (<= 2 ppm), and similar to 100% combustion efficiency are enabled for all the cases by SB atomization with the assistance of a small amount of methane.

AB Real-time thermal monitoring and regulation are critical to the mitigation of thermal runaways and device failures in two-phase cooling systems. Compared to conventional approaches that rely on the Joule effect, thermal gradient or transverse thermoelectric effect, acoustic emission (AE)-based remote sensing is more promising for robust and non-intrusive thermal monitoring. Nevertheless, due to the high stochasticity and noise of acoustic signals, existing implementations of AE in thermal systems have been limited to qualitative state monitoring. In this paper, we present a technology for real-time heat flux quantification during two-phase cooling by coupling acoustic sensing using hydrophones and condenser microphones and regression-based machine learning frameworks. These frameworks integrate a fast Fourier transform feature extraction algorithm with regressors, i.e., Gaussian process regressor and multilayer perceptron regressor for heat flux predictions. The acoustic signals and heat fluxes are collected from pool boiling tests under transient heat loads. It is shown that both hydrophone and condenser microphone signals are successful in predicting heat flux. Multiple models are trained and compared some using only one form of acoustic data while others combine both acoustic types (i.e., hydrophone and microphone) in fusion ML models (i.e., early, joint, late). The models using only hydrophone data are shown to perform better than the models using only microphone data. Also, some forms of fusion are shown to have better performance than either of the single input data type models. This AE-ML technology is demonstrated for accurate heat flux quantification. As such, this work will not only lead to a light, low-cost, and non-contact thermal measurement technology but also a new perspective for the physical explanation of bubble dynamics during boiling.

AB Let P-1,..., P-m is an element of K[y] be polynomials with distinct degrees, no constant terms and coefficients in a general local field K. We give a quantitative count of the number of polynomial progressions x, x+ P-1(y),..., x + P-m(y) lying in a set S subset of K of positive density. The proof relies on a general L-infinity inverse theorem which is of independent interest. This inverse theorem implies a Sobolev improving estimate for multilinear polynomial averaging operators which in turn implies our quantitative estimate for polynomial progressions. This general Sobolev inequality has the potential to be applied in a number of problems in real, complex and p-adic analysis.

AB SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) proteins undergo extensive glycosylation, aiding in proper folding, enhancing stability, and evading host immune surveillance. In this study, we used mass spectrometric analysis to elucidate the N-glycosylation characteristics and disulfide bonding of recombinant spike proteins derived from the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) in comparison with the D614G spike variant. Furthermore, we conducted microsecond-long molecular dynamics simulations on spike proteins to resolve how the different N-glycans impact spike conformational sampling in the two variants. Our findings reveal that the Omicron spike protein maintains an overall resemblance to the D614G spike variant in terms of site-specific glycan processing and disulfide bond formation. Nonetheless, alterations in glycans were observed at certain N-glycosylation sites. These changes, in synergy with mutations within the Omicron spike protein, result in increased surface accessibility of the macromolecule, including the ectodomain, receptor-binding domain, and N-terminal domain. Additionally, mutagenesis and pull-down assays reveal the role of glycosylation of a specific sequon (N149); furthermore, the correlation of MD simulation and HDX-MS identified several high-dynamic areas of the spike proteins. These insights contribute to our understanding of the interplay between structure and function, thereby advancing effective vaccination and therapeutic strategies.

AB Within oxygen minimum zones, anaerobic processes transform bioavailable nitrogen (N) into the gases dinitrogen (N-2) and nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas. Mesoscale eddies in these regions create heterogeneity in dissolved N tracers and O-2 concentrations, influencing nonlinear N cycle reactions that depend on them. Here, we use an eddy-resolving model of the Eastern Tropical South Pacific to show that eddies enhance N-2 production by between 43% and 64% at the expense of reducing N2O production by between 94% and 104% due to both the steep increase of progressive denitrification steps at vanishing oxygen, and the more effective inhibition of N2O consumption relative to production. Our findings reveal the critical role of eddies in shaping the N cycle of oxygen minimum zones, which is not currently represented by coarse models used for climate studies.

AB Sparse regression and feature extraction are the cornerstones of knowledge discovery from massive data. Their goal is to discover interpretable and predictive models that provide simple relationships among scientific variables. While the statistical tools for model discovery are well established in the context of linear regression, their generalization to nonlinear regression in material modeling is highly problem-specific and insufficiently understood. Here we explore the potential of neural networks for automatic model discovery and induce sparsity by a hybrid approach that combines two strategies: regularization and physical constraints. We integrate the concept of L-p regularization for subset selection with constitutive neural networks that leverage our domain knowledge in kinematics and thermodynamics. We train our networks with both, synthetic and real data, and perform several thousand discovery runs to infer common guidelines and trends: L-2 regularization or ridge regression is unsuitable for model discovery; L-1 regularization or lasso promotes sparsity, but induces strong bias that may aggressively change the results; only L-0 regularization allows us to transparently fine-tune the trade-off between interpretability and predictability, simplicity and accuracy, and bias and variance. With these insights, we demonstrate that L-p regularized constitutive neural networks can simultaneously discover both, interpretable models and physically meaningful parameters. We anticipate that our findings will generalize to alternative discovery techniques such as sparse and symbolic regression, and to other domains such as biology, chemistry, or medicine. Our ability to automatically discover material models from data could have tremendous applications in generative material design and open new opportunities to manipulate matter, alter properties of existing materials, and discover new materials with user-defined properties.

AB In recent years, domain-specific accelerators (DSAs) have gained popularity for applications such as deep learning and autonomous driving. To facilitate DSA designs, programmers use high-level synthesis (HLS) to compile a high-level description written in C/C++ into a design with low-level hardware description languages that eventually synthesize DSAs on circuits. However, creating a high-quality HLS design still demands significant domain knowledge, particularly in microarchitecture decisions expressed as pragmas. Thus, it is desirable to automate such decisions with the help of machine learning for predicting the quality of HLS designs, requiring a deeper understanding of the program that consists of original code and pragmas. Naturally, these programs can be considered as sequence data. In addition, these programs can be compiled and converted into a control data flow graph (CDFG). But existing works either fail to leverage both modalities or combine the two in shallow or coarse ways. We propose ProgSG, a model that allows interaction between the source code sequence modality and the graph modality in a deep and fine-grained way. To alleviate the scarcity of labeled designs, a pre-training method is proposed based on a suite of compiler's data flow analysis tasks. Experimental results show that ProgSG reduces the RMSE of design performance predictions by up to 22%, and identifies designs with an average of 1.10x and 1.26x (up to 8.17x and 13.31x) performance improvement in design space exploration (DSE) task compared to HARP and AutoDSE, respectively.

AB We report the observation of terahertz field-induced second harmonic (TFISH) generation produced by directly mixing an optical probe beam onto femtosecond plasma filaments. The produced TFISH signal is spatially separated from the laser-induced supercontinuum by impinging on the plasma at a noncollinear angle. The conversion efficiency of the fundamental probe beam to its second harmonic (SH) beam is greater than 0.02%, which represents a record in optical probe to TFISH conversion efficiency that is nearly five orders of magnitude larger than previous experiments. We also present the terahertz (THz) spectral buildup of the source along the plasma filament and retrieve coherent terahertz signal measurements. This method of analysis has the potential to provide local electric field strength measurements inside of the filament. (c) 2022 Optica Publishing Group

AB Identifying molecular specializations in cortical circuitry supporting complex behaviors, like learned vocalizations, requires understanding of the neuroanatomical context from which these circuits arise. In songbirds, the robust arcopallial nucleus (RA) provides descending cortical projections for fine vocal-motor control. Using single-nuclei transcriptomics and spatial gene expression mapping in zebra finches, we have defined cell types and molecular specializations that distinguish RA from adjacent regions involved in non-vocal motor and sensory processing. We describe an RA-specific projection neuron, differential inhibitory subtypes, and glia specializations and have probed predicted GABAergic interneuron subtypes electrophysiologically within RA. Several cell-specific markers arise developmentally in a sex-dependent manner. Our interactive apps integrate cellular data with developmental and spatial distribution data from the gene expression brain atlas ZEBrA. Users can explore molecular specializations of vocal-motor neurons and support cells that likely reflect adaptations key to the physiology and evolution of vocal control circuits and refined motor skills.

AB Background: Stalk lodging is the structural failure of crops due to external loading such as wind. Short-stature (i. e., dwarf) varieties of wheat and rice have shown promise in reducing lodging rates. However, similar dwarfing in large gains like maize and sorghum has typically been accompanied by undesirable commercial characteris-tics, including significantly decreased grain yields. The purpose of this paper is to quantify the relationship between lodging resistance and plant height in maize to better understand the potential impact of short-stature varieties of maize on lodging resistance.Results: Results from both the engineering analysis and the experimental field study indicate a nearly 1:1 rela-tionship between plant height and plant lodging resistance. These data support the validity of the engineering analysis and suggest that there exists a nearly linear relationship between crop lodging incidence and plant height.Conclusions: Plant height has a direct and quantifiable impact on crop lodging resistance as it influences the bending stresses experienced in the plant stem. This study presents the engineering analysis, supported by field experiments, that explains the cause of this nearly linear 1:1 relationship.

AB Since the 1990 s, the UN Security Council increased its use of targeted sanctions, yet we know very little about their unintended impact on civilian victimization, especially at the local level. This study argues that imposing sanctions on armed actors may compel them to seize non-sanctioned agricultural resources to replenish lost revenues and use violence to facilitate appropriation. A new dataset on sanctioned group violence in agricultural areas is developed by matching UN sanctions data with information on local attacks on civilians from the UCDP GED and combining these data with a new geographic dataset. Quantitative analyses establish that monthly changes in cash crop productivity affect political violence by sanctioned actors in Africa, while violence by unsanctioned and pre-sanctioned actors is unaffected. A short case study of Somalia validates the hypothesized mechanism by showing that al-Shabaab actively engaged in violence over such substitution dynamics.

AB Bilingualism has been shown to modify infants' responses in a range of domains. In particular, early bilingual experience is associated with greater flexibility and openness in infant perception and learning. In this study, we investigated whether bilingual infants demonstrate more fundamental differences in how they explore their environment in ways that could contribute to greater openness. Specifically, we investigated whether bilingual infants orient more rapidly to new information. Capitalizing on a classic paradigm by Fantz (1964), monolingual and bilingual infants (5-6 months and 8-9 months) were simultaneously presented with familiar and novel stimuli. As they received increased exposure to the familiar and novel stimuli, monolingual infants demonstrated a null preference, followed by a novelty preference, as previously evidenced in Fantz's study. In contrast, an orientation toward novelty emerged more readily in bilingual infants. Characteristics of a bilingual environment that may modulate the allocation of attention toward novelty are discussed.

AB A major intent of scientific research is the replication of the behaviour observed in natural spaces. In robotics, these can be through biomimetic movements in devices and inspiration from diverse actions in nature, also known as bioinspired features. An interesting pathway enabling both features is the fabrication of soft actuators. Specifically, 3D-printing has been explored as a potential approach for the development of biomimetic and bioinspired soft actuators. The extent of this method is highlighted through the large array of applications and techniques used to create these devices, as applications from the movement of fern trees to contraction in organs are explored. In this review, different 3D-printing fabrication methods, materials, and types of soft actuators, and their respective applications are discussed in depth. Finally, the extent of their use for present operations and future technological advances are discussed.

AB Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is a highly contagious viral disease with high mortality rate. There is no vaccine against SARS, but the spread can be limited by masking or social distancing. In this paper we implement a game-theoretic model of voluntary precautions against SARS. We build on the compartmental ODE model of the 2003 SARS epidemic. We assume that susceptible individuals can mask and/or limit contacts with others in order to decrease their chances of contracting SARS. Since the risk of SARS infection depends on the actions of others, this creates a public goods game. We find the Nash equilibrium, the solution of the game, which is the optimal voluntary level of precautions the individuals should take. We also study the effects of such actions on the spread of SARS and show that the effect significantly depends on the individual cost of the precautions. As soon as the cost rises above a critical threshold, the individuals will have no incentive to use any kind of voluntary precaution.

AB Organic hydroperoxides (ROOH) are ubiquitous in the atmospheric oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as well as in low-temperature oxidation of hydrocarbon fuels. The present work focuses on a prototypical cyclic hydroperoxide, cyclohexyl hydroperoxide (CHHP). The overtone OH stretch (2 nu OH) spectrum of jet-cooled CHHP is recorded by IR multiphoton excitation with UV laser-induced fluorescence detection of the resulting OH products. A distinctive IR feature is observed at 7012.5 cm-1. Two conformers of CHHP are predicted to have similar stabilities (within 0.2 kcal mol-1) and overtone OH stretch transitions (2 nu OH), yet are separated by a significant interconversion barrier. The IR power dependence indicates that absorption of three or more IR photons is required for dissociation of CHHP to cyclohexoxy (RO) and OH radical products. Accompanying high-level single- and multi-reference electronic structure calculations quantitatively support the experimental results. Calculations are extended to a range of organic hydroperoxides to examine trends in bond dissociation energies associated with RO + OH formation and compared with prior theoretical results.
   Vibrational spectroscopy and dissociation dynamics of a prototypical cyclic hydroperoxide, cyclohexyl hydroperoxide has been studied using a combination of synthesis, spectroscopy, and theoretical methods.

TI Stability Study of Molecularly Doped Semiconducting Polymers
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C
LA English
DT Article
ID DOPANT; TRANSPORT; FE
AB Molecular doping of semiconducting polymers has emerged as a prominent research topic in the field of organic electronics, with new dopant molecules introduced regularly. FeCl3 has gained attention as a p-type dopant due to its low cost, availability, ability to dope high ionization energy copolymers, and its use as a dopant that can be used with anion exchange. Here, we use a combination of UV-vis-NIR spectroscopy, four-probe sheet resistance measurements, and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy to perform lifetime measurements to assess the stability of the doped polymers over time, which is crucial for evaluating the long-term performance and reliability of the doped films. We used gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS) to prove that FeCl3 can cause radical side reactions that damage the conjugated polymer backbone, leading to the degradation of the electronic properties. The rate of this degradation is orders of magnitude higher when the film is exposed to air. Anion exchange doping can reduce the [FeCl4](-) concentration, but does not necessarily improve the doping lifetime because anion exchange electrolytes can serve as coreactants for the degradation reaction. By comparison, doping with (2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-2,5-cyclohexadiene-1,4-diylidene)dimalononitrile (F4TCNQ) as the reactive dopant results in lower initial conductivity, but the lifetime of the doped polymer is almost tripled as compared to that of FeCl3 doped polymer films. These findings highlight that the use of FeCl3 as a molecular dopant requires a cost-benefit analysis between higher initial doping levels and lower film stability.

AB The conformer distribution of normal-propyl cyanide is investigated using broadband chirped pulse rotational spectroscopy in the millimeter-wave regime coupled with buffer gas cooling. Here we explore the relative abundances of the anti and gauche conformers following room-temperature gas-phase injection into a 25 K buffer gas cell and compare to that which is observed following temperature programmed desorption from an ice surface, similar to the slow warm-up experienced by ice grains as they approach warmer regions within the interstellar medium. The conformer distributions observed in the gas phase from room temperature injection are then used to determine their relative energies, an important parameter needed to interpret the isomer and conformer abundances derived from astronomical observations. We find the gauche conformer to be the most stable species by similar to 97 +/- 21 cm(-1). We further examine the relative conformer abundances following ice desorption, which are distinct from those following the gas-phase introduction. The ratios measured off the ice correspond to a conformer temperature of similar to 56 K, which is much lower than their sublimation temperature of 170 K.

AB The development of high-performance polyether ether ketone (PEEK) composites often encounters manufacturing challenges such as porosity, difficulty in wetting fibers, low crystallinity, and poor interfacial adhesion, stemming from PEEK's high melt viscosity and chemically stable structure. While numerous studies have aimed to enhance fiber-resin compatibility in PEEK using novel sizing agents made of thermally stable miscible thermoplastics, this study explores a promising alternative: reactive processing to chemically modify the PEEK matrix. Utilizing elemental sulfur to foster chain scission and crosslinking within the resin and to modify the surface chemistry of carbon fibers, our research investigates the effectiveness of sulfur as a simple additive in carbon fiber reinforced PEEK (CF-PEEK) composites to improve crystallinity and mechanical performance. Leveraging PEEK's high processing temperatures, the study explores in-situ chemical modification during the melt phase, incorporating sulfur via spray coating alongside graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) functionalized with cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs). This approach evaluates sulfur's impact across different filler scales and establishes the reaction conditions necessary for chemical modifications of PEEK and carbon fibers. Our findings indicate that trace amounts of sulfur (0.05 wt% or less) increase the flexural strength from 780 to 800 MPa reaching similar to 900 MPa without affecting interlaminar shear performance. The trace amount of sulfur can also improve the degree of crystallinity by 10% in multiscale CNC:GNP-CF-PEEK composites and diminish the effects of poor dispersion and agglomeration in added GNPs. Sulfur's ability to reduce melt viscosity through a chain scission mechanism synergizes with GNP's capacity to boost crystallization rates via improved surface nucleation.

AB Recombination directionality factors (RDFs) for large serine integrases (LSIs) are cofactor proteins that control the directionality of recombination to favour excision over insertion. Although RDFs are predicted to bind their cognate LSIs in similar ways, there is no overall common structural theme across LSI RDFs, leading to the suggestion that some of them may be moonlighting proteins with other primary functions. To test this hypothesis, we searched for characterized proteins with structures similar to the predicted structures of known RDFs. Our search shows that the RDFs for two LSIs, TG1 integrase and Bxb1 integrase, show high similarities to a single-stranded DNA binding (SSB) protein and an editing exonuclease, respectively. We present experimental data to show that Bxb1 RDF is probably an exonuclease and TG1 RDF is a functional SSB protein. We used mutational analysis to validate the integrase-RDF interface predicted by AlphaFold2 multimer for TG1 integrase and its RDF, and establish that control of recombination directionality is mediated via protein-protein interaction at the junction of recombinase's second DNA binding domain and the base of the coiled-coil domain.

AB Immobilized molecular electrocatalysts can exhibit altered proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) chemistry compared to their nonimmobilized counterparts. Recent experiments suggested that immobilization of a cobalt tetraphenylporphyrin (CoTPP) on a graphitic surface causes the rate-limiting PCET step for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) to proceed through a concerted rather than sequential mechanism. Theoretical studies indicated that protonation of Co(II)TPP is accompanied by abstraction of an electron from the graphitic surface to form Co(III)HTPP in this concerted PCET mechanism. Herein, we investigate the kinetics of this PCET reaction to obtain fundamental mechanistic insights that will guide the design of more effective electrocatalysts. We calculate the rate constant using a vibronically nonadiabatic PCET theory that treats all electrons and the transferring proton quantum mechanically and includes hydrogen tunneling effects. The input quantities to the PCET rate constant expression are obtained from density functional theory calculations on an explicit atomistic model of the CoTPP, a protonated water cluster, and the graphitic electrode surface. The calculated kinetic isotope effect and transfer coefficients are in good agreement with experimental measurements. These calculations show that hydrogen tunneling is significant in this process and that the PCET rate constant depends on contributions from excited vibronic states. This work provides valuable insights into the PCET process occurring at this immobilized electrocatalyst and offers a theoretical strategy that can be applied to related systems.

AB Release of iron (Fe) from continental shelves is a major source of this limiting nutrient for phytoplankton in the open ocean, including productive Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems. The mechanisms governing the transport and fate of Fe along continental margins remain poorly understood, reflecting interaction of physical and biogeochemical processes that are crudely represented by global ocean biogeochemical models. Here, we use a submesoscale-permitting physical-biogeochemical model to investigate processes governing the delivery of shelf-derived Fe to the open ocean along the northern U.S. West Coast. We find that a significant fraction (similar to 20%) of the Fe released by sediments on the shelf is transported offshore, fertilizing the broader Northeast Pacific Ocean. This transport is governed by two main pathways that reflect interaction between the wind-driven ocean circulation and Fe release by low-oxygen sediments: the first in the surface boundary layer during upwelling events; the second in the bottom boundary layer, associated with pervasive interactions of the poleward California Undercurrent with bottom topography. In the water column interior, transient and standing eddies strengthen offshore transport, counteracting the onshore pull of the mean upwelling circulation. Several hot-spots of intense Fe delivery to the open ocean are maintained by standing meanders in the mean current and enhanced by transient eddies and seasonal oxygen depletion. Our results highlight the importance of fine-scale dynamics for the transport of Fe and shelf-derived elements from continental margins to the open ocean, and the need to improve representation of these processes in biogeochemical models used for climate studies.
   Iron is an essential nutrient that supports the life of marine organisms. In the ocean, large quantities of iron are released by sediments found along the continents. However, this iron is not very soluble, and it tends to precipitate back to the sediments close to where it is released. In fact, we still struggle to understand how enough of this iron makes its way to the open ocean, where it fertilizes phytoplankton and sustains fisheries. In this study, we use a sophisticated computer simulation of the ocean currents and chemistry of the northern U.S. West Coast to study the transport of iron released along the continent to the open ocean. This computer simulation is able to reproduce the currents observed along the coast with high realism, including small swirls, eddies, and meanders that constantly mix coastal waters with open ocean waters. We found that about one-fifth of all the iron released by sediments along the coast is transported offshore, where it can sustain the life of marine organisms. This transport from the coast to the open ocean mostly takes place near the surface, reflecting upwelling caused by winds in the summer, and near the bottom, reflecting transport caused by the friction of the poleward California Undercurrent with the seafloor. We also found that episodic swirls, eddies, and meanders reinforce this delivery of iron to the open ocean, in particular along several "hot-spots" of intense transport along the coast. Our results suggest that global computer simulations used to study how marine ecosystems respond to climate change should improve how they represent small-scale currents and their effects on the cycle of iron, in particular along the ocean's coastlines.
   Shelf-to-basin transport is a major source of iron to the North East Pacific Ocean Half of this transport occurs year-round by downslope Ekman flow in the bottom boundary layer, sustained by the poleward California Undercurrent Regional hot-spots of iron transport are sustained by meanders in the poleward undercurrent and local bottom oxygen depletion

AB The adaptive bitrate selection (ABR) mechanism, which decides the bitrate for each video chunk is an important part of video streaming. There has been significant interest in developing Reinforcement-Learning (RL) based ABR algorithms because of their ability to learn efficient bitrate actions based on past data and their demonstrated improvements over wired, 3G and 4G networks. However, the Quality of Experience (QoE), especially video stall time, of state-of-the-art ABR algorithms including the RL-based approaches falls short of expectations over commercial mmWave 5G networks, due to widely and wildly fluctuating throughput. These algorithms find optimal policies for a multi-objective unconstrained problem where the policies inherently depend on the predefined weight parameters of the multiple objectives (e.g., bitrate maximization, stall-time minimization). Our empirical evaluation suggests that such a policy cannot adequately adapt to the high variations of 5G throughput, resulting in long stall times.
   To address these issues, we formulate the ABR selection problem as a constrained Markov Decision Process where the objective is to maximize the QoE subject to a stall-time constraint. The strength of this formulation is that it helps mitigate the stall time while maintaining high bitrates. We propose COREL, a primal-dual actor-critic RL algorithm, which incorporates an additional critic network to estimate stall time compared to existing RL-based approaches and can tune the optimal dual variable or weight to guide the policy towards minimizing stall time. Our experiment results across various commercial mmWave 5G traces reveal that COREL reduces the average stall time by a factor of 4 and the 95th percentile by a factor of 2.

AB Here, we discuss recent advances and pressing challenges in achieving sustainable urea synthesis. Urea stands out as the most prevalent nitrogen-based fertilizer used across the globe, making up over 50% of all manufactured fertilizers. Historically, the Bosch-Meiser process has been the go-to chemical manufacturing method for urea production. This procedure, characterized by its high-temperature and high-pressure conditions, reacts ammonia with carbon dioxide to form ammonium carbamate. Subsequently, this ammonium carbamate undergoes dehydration, facilitated by heat, producing solid urea. A concerning aspect of this method is its dependency on fossil fuels, as nearly all the process heat comes from nonrenewable sources. Consequently, the Bosch-Meiser process leaves behind a considerable carbon footprint. Current estimates predict that unchecked, carbon emissions from urea production alone might skyrocket, reaching a staggering 286 Mt(CO2,eq)/yr by 2050. Such projections paint a clear picture regarding the necessity for more eco-friendly, sustainable urea production methods. Recently, the scientific community has shown growing interest in forming C-N bonds using alternative methods. Shifting toward photochemical or electrochemical processes, as opposed to traditional thermal-based processes, promises the potential for complete electrification of urea synthesis. This shift toward process electrification is not just an incremental change; it represents a groundbreaking advancement, the first of many steps, toward achieving deep decarbonization in the chemical manufacturing sector. Since the turn of 2020, there has been a surge in research focusing on photochemical and electrochemical urea synthesis. These methods capitalize on co-reduction of carbon dioxide with nitrogenous reactants like NOx and N-2. Despite the progress, there are significant challenges that hinder these processes from reaching their full potential. In this comprehensive review, we shed light on the advances made in electrified C-N bond formation. More importantly, we focus on the invaluable insights gathered over the years, especially concerning catalytic reaction mechanisms. We have dedicated a section to underline key focal areas for up-and-coming research, emphasizing catalyst, electrolyte, and reactor design. It is undeniable that catalyst design remains at the heart of the matter, as managing the co-reduction of two distinct reactants (CO2 and nitrogenous species) is complex. This process results in a myriad of intermediates, which must be adeptly managed to both maintain catalyst activity and avoid catalyst deactivation. Moreover, the electrolytes play a pivotal role, essentially dictating the creation of optimal microenvironments that drive reaction selectivity. Finally, reactor engineering stands out as crucial to ensure optimal mass transport for all involved reactants and subsequent products. We touch upon the broader environmental ramifications of urea production and bring to light potential obstacles for alternative synthesis routes. A notable mention is the urgency of accelerating the uptake and large-scale implementation of renewable energy sources.

AB Learning multi-agent system dynamics has been extensively studied for various real-world applications, such as molecular dynamics in biology, multi-body system in physics, and particle dynamics in material science. Most of the existing models are built to learn single system dynamics, which learn the dynamics from observed historical data and predict the future trajectory. In practice, however, we might observe multiple systems that are generated across different environments, which differ in latent exogenous factors such as temperature and gravity. One simple solution is to learn multiple environment-specific models, but it fails to exploit the potential commonalities among the dynamics across environments and offers poor prediction results where per-environment data is sparse or limited. Here, we present GG-ODE (Generalized Graph Ordinary Differential Equations), a machine learning framework for learning continuous multi-agent system dynamics across environments. Our model learns system dynamics using neural ordinary differential equations (ODE) parameterized by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to capture the continuous interaction among agents. We achieve the model generalization by assuming the dynamics across different environments are governed by common physics laws that can be captured via learning a shared ODE function. The distinct latent exogenous factors learned for each environment are incorporated into the ODE function to account for their differences. To improve model performance, we additionally design two regularization losses to (1) enforce the orthogonality between the learned initial states and exogenous factors via mutual information minimization; and (2) reduce the temporal variance of learned exogenous factors within the same system via contrastive learning. Experiments over various physical simulations show that our model can accurately predict system dynamics, especially in the long range, and can generalize well to new systems with few observations.

ID COMPUTATION
AB We study online learning and equilibrium computation in games with polyhedral decision sets, a property shared by normal-form games (NFGs) and extensive-form games (EFGs), when the learning agent is restricted to utilizing a best-response oracle. We show how to achieve constant regret in zero-sum games and O(T-1/4) regret in general-sum games while using only O(log t) best-response queries at a given iteration t, thus improving over the best prior result, which required O(T) queries per iteration. Moreover, our framework yields the first last-iterate convergence guarantees for self-play with best-response oracles in zero-sum games. This convergence occurs at a linear rate, though with a condition-number dependence. We go on to show a O(1/root T) best-iterate convergence rate without such a dependence. Our results build on linear-rate convergence results for variants of the Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm for strongly convex and smooth minimization problems over polyhedral domains. These FW results depend on a condition number of the polytope, known as facial distance. In order to enable application to settings such as EFGs, we show two broad new results: 1) the facial distance for polytopes of the form {x is an element of R->= 0(n) vertical bar Ax = b} is at least gamma/root k where. is the minimum value of a nonzero coordinate of a vertex in the polytope and k <= n is the number of tight inequality constraints in the optimal face, and 2) the facial distance for polytopes of the form Ax = b, Cx <= d, x >= 0 where x is an element of R-n, C >= 0 is a nonzero integral matrix, and d >= 0, is at least 1/(vertical bar vertical bar C vertical bar vertical bar(infinity)root n). This yields the first such results for several problems, such as sequence-form polytopes, flow polytopes, and matching polytopes.

AB Managing privacy to reach privacy goals is challenging, as evidenced by the privacy attitude-behavior gap. Mitigating this discrepancy requires solutions that account for both system opaqueness and users' hesitations in testing different privacy settings due to fears of unintended data exposure. We introduce an empathy-based approach that allows users to experience how privacy attributes may alter system outcomes in a risk-free sandbox environment from the perspective of artificially generated personas. To generate realistic personas, we introduce a novel pipeline that augments the outputs of large language models (e.g., GPT-4) using few-shot learning, contextualization, and chain of thoughts. Our empirical studies demonstrated the adequate quality of generated personas and highlighted the changes in privacy-related applications (e.g., online advertising) caused by different personas. Furthermore, users demonstrated cognitive and emotional empathy towards the personas when interacting with our sandbox. We offered design implications for downstream applications in improving user privacy literacy.

TI Model-Free Neural Fault Detection and Isolation for Safe Control
SO IEEE CONTROL SYSTEMS LETTERS

DT Article
DE Fault detection; machine learning; neural networks
AB A sudden actuator fault in a safety-critical system can cause safety violations and lead to severe consequences. Existing fault-tolerant control (FTC) approaches normally focus on maintaining system performance and do not consider system safety. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have emerged as useful tools from control theory for providing safety guarantees for control systems. However, existing applications of CBFs either do not consider actuator faults or only consider the special case where it is known which actuator is faulty or the case when redundant actuators are present to maintain controllability even under faults and failures. In this letter, we address the problem of safe recovery under a more realistic scenario where it is completely unknown which actuator is faulty and when the fault occurs. We develop a novel model-free learning framework for an output-based neural fault-detector that detects when a fault occurs and in which actuator. Based on the learned functions, we propose a switching framework for automatically detecting and recovering from faults. We evaluate our method on a case study involving a Crazyflie quadrotor with a motor failure.

ID SECURITY
AB Password-based authentication is one of the most commonly adopted mechanisms for online security. Choosing strong passwords is crucial for protecting ones' digital identities and assets, as weak passwords can be readily guessable, resulting in a compromise such as unauthorized access. To promote the use of strong passwords on the Web, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) provides website administrators with password composition policy (PCP) guidelines. We manually inspect popular websites to check if their password policies conform to NIST's PCP guidelines by generating passwords that meet each criterion and testing the 100 popular websites. Our findings reveal that a considerable number of websites (on average, 53.5%) do not comply with the guidelines, which could result in password breaches.

AB Our study reveals the underlying principles governing the passive membrane permeability in three large N-methylated macrocyclic peptides (N-MeMPs): cyclosporine A (CycA), Alisporivir (ALI), and cyclosporine H (CycH). We determine a series of conformers required for robust passive membrane diffusion and those relevant to other functions, such as binding to protein targets or intermediates, in the presence of solvent additives. We investigate the conformational interconversions and establish correlations with the membrane permeability. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and cyclic ion-mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry (cIMS-MS) are employed to characterize conformational heterogeneity and identify cis-amides relevant for good membrane permeability. In addition, ion mobility selected cIMS-MS and infrared (IR) multiple-photon dissociation (IRMPD) spectroscopy experiments are conducted to evaluate the energy barriers between conformations. We observe that CycA and ALI, both cyclosporines with favorable membrane permeabilities, display multiple stable and well-defined conformers. In contrast, CycH, an epimer of CycA with limited permeability, exhibits fewer and fewer stable conformers. We demonstrate the essential role of the conformational shift from the aqueous cis MeVal11-MeBmt1 state (A1) to the closed conformation featuring cis MeLeu9-MeLeu10 (C1) in facilitating membrane permeation. Additionally, we highlight that the transition from A1 to the all-trans open conformation (O1) is specifically triggered by the presence of CaCl2. We also capture a set of conformers with cis Sar3-MeLeu4, MeLeu9-MeLeu10, denoted as I. Conformationally selected cIMS-MS and IRMPD data of [CycA+Ca](2+) show immediate repopulation of the original population distribution, suggesting that CaCl2 smooths out the energy barriers. Finally, our work presents an improved sampling molecular dynamics approach based on a refined force field that not only consistently and accurately captures established conformers of cyclosporines but also exhibits strong predictive capabilities for novel conformers.

AB Motivated by applications in natural resource management, risk management, and finance, this paper is focused on an ergodic two-sided singular control problem for a general one-dimensional diffusion process. The control is given by a bounded variation process. Under some mild conditions, the optimal reward value as well as an optimal control policy are derived by the vanishing discount method. Moreover, the Abelian and Cesaro limits are established. Then a direct solution approach is provided at the end of the paper.

AB Network-constrained events, including for example traffic accidents and crime incidents, are widespread in urban environments. Understanding spatial patterns of these events within network spaces is essential for deciphering the underlying dynamics and supporting informed decision-making. The fusion and analysis of network-constrained point data pose significant computational challenges, particularly with large datasets and sophisticated algorithms. In this context, we introduce NetPointLib, a computationally efficient library designed for processing and analyzing large-scale event data in network spaces. NetPointLib utilizes the capabilities of high-performance computing (HPC) environments including ROGER supercomputer, ACCESS resources, and the CyberGISX platform, providing a scalable and accessible framework for conducting network point data fusion and pattern analysis and supporting computational reproducibility. The library encompasses several algorithmic implementations, including the network local K function and network scan statistics, to enable researchers and practitioners to identify spatial patterns within network-constrained data. This is achieved by harnessing the computational power of HPC resources, facilitating advanced spatial analysis in an efficient and scalable manner.

AB In fusion research, simulations are extensively used to validate basic theory, plan experiments, interpret results on present devices, and to design future devices. CGYRO is a premier tool for multi-scale fusion plasma turbulence simulation and has been in use by the fusion community for several years. It operates on large memory buffers, making it very sensitive to memory system performance. In this poster we compare CGYRO fusion simulation benchmark results of the HBM-based Intel Xeon Max CPUs at the TACC Stampede3 HPC system against equivalent DDR4-based HPC CPUs and confirm that HBM memory provides a significant performance boost. We also provide benchmark results for modern HPC GPUs, which show that HBM memory is not enough to completely bridge the CGYRO fusion simulation performance gap between CPUs and GPUs.

AB This article delves into the challenges of ensuring stability (in some sense) and robustness in large-scale second-order consensus networks (SOCNs) and autonomous vehicle platoons in the discrete-time domain. We propose a graph-theoretic methodology for designing a state feedback law for these systems in a discrete-time framework. By analyzing the behavior of the solutions of the networks based on the algebraic properties of the Laplacian matrices of the underlying graphs and on the value of the update cycle (also known as the time step) of each vehicle, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the stability of a linear second-order consensus network in the discrete-time domain. We then perform an $\mathcal {H}_{2}$-based robustness analysis to demonstrate the relationship between the $\mathcal {H}_{2}$-norm of the system, network size, connectivity, and update cycles, providing insights into how these factors impact the convergence and robustness of the system. A key contribution of this work is the development of a formal framework for understanding the link between an $\mathcal {H}_{2}$-based performance measure and the restrictions on the update cycle of the vehicles. Specifically, we show that denser networks (i.e., networks with more communication links) might require faster agents (i.e., smaller update cycles) to outperform or achieve the same level of robustness as sparse networks (i.e., networks with fewer communication links) - see Fig. 1. These findings have important implications for the design and implementation of large-scale consensus networks and autonomous vehicle platoons, highlighting the need for a balance between network density and update cycle speed for optimal performance. We finish the article with results from simulations and experiments that illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in predicting the behavior of vehicle platoons, even for more complex agents with nonlinear dynamics, using Quanser's Qlabs and Qcars.

AB Measuring the diffusion coefficient of clay-based liner materials is important in estimating and predicting long-term barrier performance in waste containment facilities. Various theoretical models, including the finite cylindrical model, have been commonly used to determine the diffusion properties of clay-based liner materials in leaching tests. However, the assumption of zero-concentration boundary conditions of the traditional finite cylindrical model contradicts the measured variation of concentration in real leaching tests, likely resulting in (1) underestimated and unconservative diffusion coefficient, or (2) requirement of a relatively large liquid-to-soil ratio and frequent leachate replacement in the experiment to maintain the zero-concentration boundary condition. In this study, a theoretical model was developed to evaluate the solute diffusion process within a soil specimen under arbitrary, time-dependent concentration boundary conditions. The proposed model, incorporating the time-dependent boundary conditions, provides efficient calculations of the concentration distribution and the cumulative fraction leached of solute across the soil specimen. The example application of the proposed model to experimental data demonstrates the capability of the proposed model to determine apparent diffusion coefficients of clay-based liner materials without introducing errors associated with the assumption of a zero concentration boundary condition. The proposed model provides a comprehensive method to investigate the dynamic transport behaviors of solutes through clay-based liner materials in future studies.

AB In recent years, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have been widely applied to collect data in underwater acoustic sensor networks (UWASNs). Limited by the capacity of a single AUV, as well as the low-latency requirement of data collection, the intelligent swarm consisting of multiple AUVs is expected to execute the secure and efficient data collection tasks in a cooperative manner. However, most of the existing works assumed that the locations of sensor nodes are already known, which is impractical in a real AUV network. In addition, the security issues are not well considered in underwater searching and transmission tasks. To improve the searching efficiency in an unknown underwater area where locations of sensor nodes cannot be obtained precisely, this work proposes a data collection scheme via a target uncertainty map based multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm for AUV swarms. Specifically, the target uncertainty map is established based on the current and past searching and collection results, which can guide the AUV swarm to search the areas with higher probabilities to find sensor nodes waiting for data collection. Moreover, to mitigate the potential security risk of data leakage, we design a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) algorithm for each AUV in the swarm to make its searching and data collection strategies through a manner of centralized training with distributed execution. Simulation results validate that the proposed scheme can achieve a high collection rate with low energy consumption. In addition, the security referring to data protection can be also guaranteed in AUV swarms.

ID CHAIN
AB The lightning network (LN) is a layer-two solution in Bitcoin for support scalability. LN uses offchain micropayment channels to scale the blockchain's capability to perform instant transactions without a global block confirmation process. However, micropayment scalability in a large LN is still limited by its relatively large searching space for a suitable route. Liquidation for small nodes still remains major challenges for the LN as the amount of transactions along a channel is predetermined by the channel capacity defined by two end nodes of the channel. In this paper, we introduce the notion of supernodes and the corresponding supernodes-based pooling to address these challenges. In order to meet the high adaptivity and low maintenance cost in the dynamic LN where users join and leave, supernodes are constructed locally to avoid global information or label propagation. Each supernode, together with a subset of (non-supernodes) neighbors, forms a supernode-based pool. These pools constitute a partition of the LN. Additionally, supernodes are self-connected. Micropayment scalability is supported through node set reduction as only supernodes are involved in searching and in payment with other supernodes. Liquidation is enhanced through pooling to redistribute funds within a pool to external channels of its supernode. Extensive simulations using LN simulator CLoTH have been conducted to validate the improvement in routing scalability and liquidation of the proposed architecture under different settings.

AB To improve short-term severe weather forecasts through assimilation of polarimetric radar data (PRD), the use of accurate and efficient forward operators for polarimetric radar variables is required. In this study, a new melting model is proposed to estimate the mixing ratio and number concentration of melting hydrometeor species and incorporated in a set of parameterized polarimetric radar forward operators. The new melting model depends only on the mixing ratio and number concentration of rain and ice species and is characterized by its independence from ambient temperature and its simplicity and ease of linearization. To assess the impact of this newly proposed melting model on the simulated polarimetric radar variables, a real mesoscale convective system is simulated using three double-moment microphysics schemes. Compared with the output of the original implementation of the parameterized forward operators (PFO_Old) that rely on an "old" melting model which only estimates the mixing ratio of the melting species, the updated implementation with the new melting model (PFO_New) that estimates both the mixing ratio and number concentration of melting species eliminates the very large mass/volume-weighted mean diameter (Dm) at the bottom of the melting layer and produces more reasonable melting layer signatures for all three double-moment microphysics schemes that more closely match the corresponding radar observations. This suggests that the new melting model has more reasonable implicit estimates of mixing ratios and number concentrations of melting hydrometeor species than the "old" melting model.
   Weather radars can provide information about observed precipitation that can be used to improve weather forecast models. Making use of this information requires linking the radar observations with the variables these models predict in an efficient and accurate way. One of the most pronounced signatures in weather radar observations occurs as precipitation melts from ice into rain. However, current operational forecast models do not explicitly predict melting ice as a separate category of precipitation. Therefore, existing methods for comparing radar observations to forecast models use an empirical melting model to estimate the mass of melting ice and assume melting ice has the same concentration as the model-predicted dry ice. These assumptions result in a simulated radar melting layer signature that is unrealistically thick and low. In this study, a new melting model is proposed for estimating both the mass and concentration of melting ice, and its effects on simulated radar variables are evaluated for a severe thunderstorm case. For all of the microphysics schemes investigated, the newly proposed melting model results in improved simulations of the size of melting ice particles and simulated radar variables that are closer to those observed.
   A new melting model is proposed and introduced into forward operators for simulation of polarimetric radar data More reasonable polarimetric signatures of the melting layer are simulated using different double-moment microphysics schemes These polarimetric forward operators have potential to be used in data assimilation for improving high-resolution severe weather forecasts

DE Point Cloud; Registration; Connected Vehicles
AB The registration of LiDAR point clouds between Connected Vehicles (CVs) is the basis for vision tasks such as multi-vehicle cooperative perception and high-precision scene reconstruction. Due to the huge amount of LiDAR point cloud data and the complexity of computation, the registration has high transmission latency and execution time. Fast and accurate point cloud registration between CVs is urgently required by safe driving applications. To achieve faster registration, we propose partitioning overlapping point clouds for registration in advance. Meanwhile, for higher accuracy, we incorporate more geometric features during the registration. This paper demonstrates the Echo Registration System (ERS) developed to increase the speed of existing point cloud registration methods. ERS employs an initial positioning based on point cloud distributions, a density-consistent partition strategy, and a virtual geometric feature fusion. We deploy ERS to accelerate multiple state-of-the-art registration methods. The comprehensive results show that ERS improves the overall running time of current state-of-the-art baselines by 5.7x with 42.1% registration recall gains.

AB Understanding carrier trapping in solids has proven key to semiconductor technologies, but observations thus far have relied on ensembles of point defects, where the impact of neighboring traps or carrier screening is often important. Here, we investigate the capture of photogenerated holes by an individual negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond at room temperature. Using an externally gated potential to minimize space-charge effects, we find the capture probability under electric fields of variable sign and amplitude shows an asymmetric-bell-shaped response with maximum at zero voltage. To interpret these observations, we run semiclassical Monte Carlo simulations modeling carrier trapping through a cascade process of phonon emission and obtain electric-field-dependent capture probabilities in good agreement with experiment. Because the mechanisms at play are insensitive to the characteristics of the trap, we anticipate the capture cross sections we observe-largely exceeding those derived from ensemble measurements-may also be present in materials platforms other than diamond.

TI Machine learning a universal harmonic interatomic potential for
   predicting phonons in crystalline solids
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
AB Phonons, as quantized vibrational modes in crystalline materials, play a crucial role in determining a wide range of physical properties, such as thermal and electrical conductivity, making their study a cornerstone in materials science. In this study, we present a simple yet effective strategy for deep learning harmonic phonons in crystalline solids by leveraging existing phonon databases and state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. The key of our method lies in transforming existing phonon datasets, primarily represented in interatomic force constants, into a force-displacement representation suitable for training machine learning universal interatomic potentials. By applying our approach to one of the largest phonon databases publicly available, we demonstrate that the resultant machine learning universal harmonic interatomic potential not only accurately predicts full harmonic phonon spectra but also calculates key thermodynamic properties with remarkable precision. Furthermore, the restriction to a harmonic potential energy surface in our model provides a way of assessing uncertainty in machine learning predictions of vibrational properties, essential for guiding further improvements and applications in materials science.

AB Sub-auroral polarization streams (SAPS) are one of the most intense manifestations of magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling. Magnetospheric energy transport to the ionosphere within SAPS is associated with Poynting flux and the precipitation of thermal energy (0.03-30 keV) plasma sheet particles. However, much less is known about the precipitation of high-energy (>= 50 keV) ions and electrons and their contribution to the low-altitude SAPS physics. This study examines precipitation within one SAPS event using a combination of equatorial THEMIS and low-altitude DMSP and ELFIN observations, which, jointly, cover from a few eV up to a few MeV energy range. Observed SAPS are embedding the ion isotropy boundary, which includes strong 300-1,000 keV ion precipitation. SAPS are associated with intense precipitation of relativistic electrons (<= 3 MeV), well equatorward of the electron isotropy boundary. Such relativistic electron precipitation is likely due to electron scattering by electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves at the equator. Plain Language Summary Magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling and dynamics are modified by precipitating ion and electron energy fluxes that alter the ionosphere's characteristics. Sub-auroral polarization streams (SAPS) are a classical example of this coupling, encompassing precipitation of plasma sheet (<30 keV) particles, intensification of field-aligned currents, and ionospheric feedback in the form of enhanced electric fields. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that SAPS are associated with precipitation of energetic ions (50-1,000 keV) and relativistic (up to a few MeV) electrons. The 50-1,000 keV ions may dominate the precipitating energy flux at low latitudes, where scattering of plasmasheet ions is significantly reduced. Relativistic electron precipitation significantly extends ionization enhancement effects to altitudes below 100 km, where these electrons deposit their energy.

TI S<sub>8</sub> Tension in the Context of Dark Matter-Baryon Scattering
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS

DT Article

AB We explore an interacting dark matter (IDM) model that allows for a fraction of dark matter (DM) to undergo velocity-independent scattering with baryons. In this scenario, structure on small scales is suppressed relative to the cold DM scenario. Using the effective field theory of large-scale structure, we perform the first systematic analysis of BOSS full-shape galaxy clustering data for the IDM scenario, and we find that this model ameliorates the S-8 tension between large-scale structure and Planck data. Adding the S8 prior from the Dark Energy Survey (DES)to our analysis further leads to a mild similar to 3 sigma preference for a nonvanishing DM-baryon scattering cross section, assuming similar to 10% of DM is interacting and has a particle mass of 1 MeV. This result produces a modest similar to 20% suppression of the linear power at k less than or similar to 1 h Mpc(-1), consistent with other small-scale structure observations. Similar scale-dependent power suppression was previously shown to have the potential to resolve S-8 tension between cosmological data sets. The validity of the specific IDM model explored here will be critically tested with upcoming galaxy surveys at the interaction level needed to alleviate the S-8 tension.

AB Most existing works on federated bandits take it for granted that all clients are altruistic about sharing their data with the server for the collective good whenever needed. Despite their compelling theoretical guarantee on performance and communication efficiency, this assumption is overly idealistic and oftentimes violated in practice, especially when the algorithm is operated over self-interested clients, who are reluctant to share data without explicit benefits. Negligence of such self-interested behaviors can significantly affect the learning efficiency and even the practical operability of federated bandit learning. In light of this, we aim to spark new insights into this under-explored research area by formally introducing an incentivized communication problem for federated bandits, where the server shall motivate clients to share data by providing incentives. Without loss of generality, we instantiate this bandit problem with the contextual linear setting and propose the first incentivized communication protocol, namely, INC-FEDUCB, that achieves near-optimal regret with provable communication and incentive cost guarantees. Extensive empirical experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets further validate the effectiveness of the proposed method across various environments.

AB We consider the problem of fairly allocating sequentially arriving items to a set of individuals. For this problem, the recently-introduced PACE algorithm leverages the dual averaging algorithm to approximate competitive equilibria and thus generate online fair allocations. PACE is simple, distributed, and parameter-free, making it appealing for practical use in large-scale systems. However, current performance guarantees for PACE require i.i.d. item arrivals. Since real-world data is rarely i.i.d., or even stationary, we study the performance of PACE on non-stationary data. We start by developing new convergence results for the general dual averaging algorithm under three nonstationary input models: adversarially-corrupted stochastic input, ergodic input, and block-independent (including periodic) input. Our results show convergence of dual averaging up to errors caused by nonstationarity of the data, and recover the classical bounds when the input data is i.i.d. Using these results, we show that the PACE algorithm for online fair allocation simultaneously achieves "best of many worlds" guarantees against any of these nonstationary input models as well as against i.i.d. input. Finally, numerical experiments show strong empirical performance of PACE against nonstationary inputs.

AB We develop a percolation model for face centered cubic binary alloys with chemical short-range order (SRO) to account for chemical ordering/clustering that occurs in nominally random solid solutions. We employ a lattice generation scheme that directly utilizes the first nearest neighbor Warren-Cowley SRO parameter to generate the lattice. We quantify the effects of SRO on the first nearest neighbor three-dimensional (3D) site percolation threshold using the large cell Monte Carlo renormalization group method and find that the 3D site percolation threshold is a function of the SRO parameter. We analyze the effects of SRO on the distribution of the total number of distinct clusters in the percolated structures and find that short-ranged clustering promotes the formation of a dominant spanning cluster. Furthermore, we find that the scaling exponents of percolation are independent of SRO. We also examine the effects of SRO on the 2D-3D percolation crossover and find that the thickness of the thin film for percolation crossover is a function of the SRO parameter. We combine these results to develop a percolation crossover model to understand the electrochemical passivation behavior in binary alloys. The percolation crossover model provides a theoretical framework to understand the critical composition of passivating elements for protective oxide formation. With this model, we show that SRO can be used as a processing parameter to improve corrosion resistance.

AB The pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumor microenvironment is distinguished by a high degree of fibrosis and inflammation, known as desmoplasia. Desmoplasia increases the stromal deposition and extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness observed in the tumor microenvironment, contributing to the dampened penetration of pharmacological agents. The molecular and biophysical composition of the ECM during the earliest cellular changes in the development of PDAC, i.e. acinar ductal metaplasia (ADM), has not been extensively explored. We report that the mRNA expression of key protein components of the ECM increases during ADM in p48Cre/+;LSL- KrasG12D (KC) mouse acinar organoids cultured in Matrigel. Treatment of the organoids with small molecular weight epigenetic modulating compounds that inhibit or reverse ADM (largazole, FK228 and chaetocin) dramatically reduced the tissue mRNA expression of collagens, hyaluronan synthase, laminin and fibronectin. The storage moduli, determined by video tracking of fluorescent nanoparticles embedded into the Matrigel, increased during ADM and was reduced following treatment with the epigenetic modulating compounds. We report that the ECM of mouse organoids stiffens during ADM and is further enhanced by the presence of mutant Kras. Moreover, select HDAC and HMT inhibitors reduced the mRNA expression of ECM components and ECM stiffness during inhibition and reversal of ADM, suggesting that these compounds may be useful as adjuvants to enhance the tumor penetration of agents used to treat PDAC.

AB Although known since antiquity, mechanochemistry has remained dormant for centuries. Nowadays, mechanochemistry is a flourishing research field at the simultaneous stages of gathering data and (often astonishing) observations, and scientific argumentation toward their analysis, for which the combination of interdisciplinary expertise is necessary. Mechanochemistry's implementation as a synthetic method is constantly increasing, although it remains far from being fully exploited, or understood on the basis of fundamental principles. This review starts by describing many remarkable advantages of mechanochemical reactions, simplifying and "greening" chemistry in solutions. This description is followed by an overview of the current main weaknesses to be addressed in the near future toward the systematic study of its energetics and chemical mechanisms. This review finishes by describing recent breakthrough experimental advances, such as in situ kinetics monitoring using synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction and Raman spectroscopy, plus equally significant computational chemistry approaches, such as quantum mechanochemistry, used for the understanding of covalent or hydrogen bond ruptures in biomolecules or mechanophores in polymers at the single-molecule level. Combined with new technologies to control temperature and pressure in ball mills, these appealing new methods are promising tools for establishing the fundamental knowledge necessary for the understanding of mechanochemical reactivity and mechanisms.

AB Succinimide and its derivatives are cyclic five-membered rings that appear in a variety of natural products and are widely used in organic synthesis. From a structural standpoint, succinimide contains an NH group in the ring which interacts with two adjacent carbonyl groups, pushing the ring structure toward planarity at the expense of increasing ring strain and eclipsing interactions among the out-of-plane hydrogen atoms in the two CH2 groups. Previous quantum chemical calculations at different levels of theory have predicted both a nonplanar C 2 structure and a planar C 2v structure, the latter of which is the most consistent with gas-phase electron diffraction measurements. Here, we report the pure rotational spectra of succinimide and N-chlorosuccinimide in the 26.5-40.0 GHz range using chirped-pulse Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy, supported by coupled cluster and density functional theory quantum chemical calculations. The spectra were fit to Watson's A-reduced effective Hamiltonian, including both 35Cl and 37Cl isotopologues of N-chlorosuccinimide as well as the N and Cl quadrupole hyperfine interactions. On the basis of the agreement with quantum chemical calculations and the measured inertial defects, we find that the rotational spectra are consistent with a planar ring structure, with a maximum out-of-plane angle of <= 5 degrees.

AB In this work, with the goal of developing a large memory window (MW) ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET) for high-density stand-alone storage applications, we provide a deep look into the MW of a FeFET and clarify the definition on the MW through combined theoretical and experimental studies. We show that the following hold: 1) conventionally thought maximum MW of a FeFET (i.e., 2 E(C)t(FE)) is accurate only for dc sweep and may not be accurate for pulsed memory operation as it neglects the contribution from other layers in the gate-stack; 2) for intrinsic FeFET operation that only depends on polarization switching, adding a dielectric layer into a FeFET gate-stack at best keeps the same MW as the one without the dielectric layer if assuming the same polarization is switched in both cases or worse as most likely less polarization can be switched; 3) by integrating FeFETs with or without a top dielectric Al2O3 layer, we demonstrate from experiment that adding a dielectric layer reduces the MW; and 4) with a 20-nm-thick HfO2, a large MW of 4.8 V is demonstrated, which can accommodate tightly distributed multilevel cell (MLC) and triple-level cell (TLC), showing the potential of FeFET as high-density storage technology.

AB A novel transient and cyclic design is proposed for ultrahigh recovery reverse osmosis (RO) desalination of brackish water. The designed system consists of two subsystems, a conventional multistage RO and a flow reversal and retentate recycle RO. The operation periodically switches between two different configurations, a series connection of the two subsystems for full production, and a parallel connection for partial production and flushing of the most concentrated membranes using the under-saturated fresh feed. Such a transient and cyclic design concept incorporates beneficial features of ROTEC's flow reversal RO (FRRO) and DuPont/Desalitech's closed-circuit RO (CCRO) in a single system. It offers operational flexibility at ultrahigh recoveries and requires a slight hardware modification to retrofit existing brackish water RO plants. Dynamic simulations show that concentration hotspots and overshoots are less severe than those in FRRO. It also avoids cycle-to-cycle salt buildups that are inevitable in CCRO given that it is an open-circuit design.

ID INTERVAL OBSERVERS; DESIGN
AB The safety monitoring for nonlinear dynamical systems with embedded neural network components is addressed in this paper. The interval-observer-based safety monitor is developed consisting of two auxiliary neural networks derived from the neural network components of the dynamical system. Due to the presence of nonlinear activation functions in neural networks, we use quadratic constraints on the global sector to abstract the nonlinear activation functions in neural networks. By combining a quadratic constraint approach for the activation function with Lyapunov theory, the interval observer design problem is transformed into a series of quadratic and linear programming feasibility problems to make the interval observer operate with the ability to correctly estimate the system state with estimation errors within acceptable limits. The applicability of the proposed method is verified by simulation of the lateral vehicle control system.

AB The development of integrated satellite-terrestrial networks has gained significant attention from both industry and academia in recent years, owing to their potential for delivering low latency, high dependability, strong resilience, ubiquitous connectivity and global broadband coverage services. However, due to the ever-changing nature of satellite topology and the complexity of diverse integrated satellite-terrestrial networks, routing requests is challenging. In this paper, the vehicle movement is uncertain introducing the intermittent connectivity related to vehicles. Therefore, we propose a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model to minimize, under uncertain latency probability distributions, the expected worst-case overall task routing delay from source to target user equipment through satellite constellation. The model addresses undetermined uploading and downloading latency between automobiles, satellites, and user equipment by employing the Wasserstein ambiguity set, allowing for unpredictable vehicle mobility and intermittent connections. By reformulating the problem into a tractable form, we determine the optimal routing path for task uploading, satellite constellation, and task downloading. Ultimately, the performance of the proposed DRO model demonstrates the model's ability to address the challenges of integrated satellite-terrestrial network routing.

AB Charge injection into a molecule on a metallic interface is a key step in many photoactivated reactions. We employ the many-body perturbation theory and compute the hole and electron injection energies for CO2 molecule on an Au nanoparticle with similar to 3,000 electrons and compare it to results for idealized infinite surfaces. We demonstrate a surprisingly large variation of the injection energy barrier depending on the precise molecular position on the surface. Multiple "hot spots," characterized by low energy barriers, arise due to the competition between the plasmonic coupling and the degree of hybridization between the molecule and the substrate. The charge injection barrier to the adsorbate on the nanoparticle surface decreases from the facet edge to the facet center. This finding contrasts with the typical picture in which the electric field enhancement on the nanoparticle edges is considered the most critical factor.

ID EMISSION
AB Quantum emitters (QEs) based on deep-level defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) layers are promising alternatives to other qubit-candidates in three-dimensional wide bandgap semiconductors. The two-dimensional (2D) form factor of hBN allows the possibility of near-deterministic placement of quantum emitters and an ease of property-tuning via different means, such as application of strain. However, the 2D nature of hBN also results in a unique set of challenges, including a sensitivity of the QEs to their environment that can influence their different properties, such as their emission frequencies and brightness. In particular, although observed experimentally, theoretical works thus far have ignored substrate-induced modulation of hBN's QE properties. As a result, to date, the magnitude of substrate effects and the underlying mechanism(s) involved in the modulation of QE properties remain unknown. In our density functional theory-based work, we use silicon dioxide as a prototype substrate to demonstrate that the substrate effects can indeed have a significant impact on ground-and excited-state properties of defects responsible for quantum emission. Our analysis shows large structural distortions at the defect sites due to substrate interactions, resulting in significant changes in quantum emission frequencies. These calculations reveal that accounting for substrate effects is critical to the successful use of hBN in quantum sensing and quantum computing.

AB This paper describes a new low void-volume in situ reaction cell for use in diffuse reflectance spectroscopic studies. It was demonstrated by means of a residence time distribution analysis that the cell's average gas residence time was relatively small (similar to 1.3 s) and within the time scale of rapid scan spectra sampling. Such combination enabled the rigorous implementation of transient periodic techniques such as modulation excitation-phase sensitive detection-diffuse reflectance Fourier infrared spectroscopy (MEPSD- DRIFTS), which allowed unique access to surface reaction intermediates in gas-solid reactions. Application of the new cell and ME-PSD-DRIFTS to the conversion of ethanol on gamma-Al2O3 at 200 degrees C demonstrated the presence of likely surface intermediate species that conform with ethanol conversion to diethyl ether via a SN2 mechanism and the involvement of several alumina hydroxyl types as possible active sites.

SO ELECTRICITY JOURNAL

ID JUSTICE
AB There is an increasing recognition of the central role of energy equity and social justice in energy planning. Governments, utilities, planners, and the research community are working to advance a more nuanced understanding of energy equity, involving distributive, procedural, recognitional, and restorative aspects. Complete energy equity requires a holistic understanding of all these aspects, and energy planning should attempt to address them simultaneously. In practice, this can be challenging in contexts where the available pool of human and economic resources is limited. This article presents a case study of a community within the Navajo Nation to illustrate the challenges and implications in such contexts. The first challenge is the inevitable prioritization and compartmentalization of decision making due to the constraints imposed by the planners' primary mandates, authority, place-based contextual factors, and available resources. The second - related - challenge is the impact of the resulting decisions on realized outcomes, and its effects on the community perceptions of - and confidence in - the planning institutions. The case study also finds that equity concerns of the utility's end-customers may not always be uniform and are influenced by the customers' perspectives, roles, responsibilities, and expectations. Thus, a more holistic view of energy planning is necessary to 1) capture the variations of equity opinions and priorities across all stakeholders, 2) to ensure that decisions and resource allocations by utilities, elected bodies, or governmental agencies occur on multiple fronts in a coordinated and transparent manner to advance energy equity targets.

AB How an organism responds to risk depends on how that individual perceives such risk. Integrating cues from multiple sensory modalities allows individuals to extract information from their environment, and whether and how the brain and body respond differently to different sensory cues can help reveal mechanistic decisionmaking processes. Here, we assessed neural, hormonal, and behavioral responses to different sensory cues of predation risk in Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata). Adult guppies were assigned to one of four treatment groups: control, visual, olfactory, and both sensory cues combined from a natural predator, the pike cichlid (Crenicichla alta), for 2 h. We found no difference in glucocorticoid response to any cue. However, we found behavioral and neural activation responses to olfactory-only cues. In addition, we found a sex by treatment effect, where males showed greater changes in neural activation in brain regions associated with avoidance behavior, while females showed greater changes in neural activation in regions associated with social behavior and memory, mirroring sex by treatment differences in behavioral antipredator responses. Altogether, our results demonstrate that single and combinatory cues may influence risk-taking behavior differently based on sex, suggesting that perception and integration of cues can cascade into sex differences in behavior.

   model; Valanis-Landel model; Constitutive artificial neural networks
ID DEFORMATION
AB Artificial meat is an eco-friendly alternative to real meat that is marketed to have a similar taste and feel. The mechanical properties of artificial meat significantly influence our perception of taste, but how precisely the mechanics of artificial meat compare to real meat remains insufficiently understood. Here we perform mechanical tension, compression, and shear tests on isotropic artificial meat (Tofurky & REG; Plant-Based Deli Slices), anisotropic artificial meat (DaringTM Chick'n Pieces) and anisotropic real meat (chicken) and analyze the data using constitutive neural networks and automated model discovery. Our study shows that, when deformed by 10%, artificial and real chicken display similar maximum stresses of 21.0 kPa and 21.8 kPa in tension,-7.2 kPa and-16.4 kPa in compression, and 2.4 kPa and 0.9 kPa in shear, while the maximum stresses for tofurky were 28.5 kPa,-38.3 kP, and 5.5 kPa. To discover the mechanics that best explain these data, we consulted two constitutive neural networks of Ogden and Valanis-Landel type. Both networks robustly discover models and parameters to explain the complex nonlinear behavior of artificial and real meat for individual tension, compression, and shear tests, and for all three tests combined. When constrained to the classical neo Hooke, Blatz Ko, and Mooney Rivlin models, both networks discover shear moduli of 94.4 kPa for tofurky, 35.7 kPa for artificial chick'n, and 21.4 kPa for real chicken. Our results suggests that artificial chicken succeeds in reproducing the mechanical properties of real chicken across all loading modes, while tofurky does not, and is about three times stiffer. Strikingly, all three meat products display shear softening and their resistance to shear is about an order of magnitude lower than their resistance to tension and compression. We anticipate our study to inspire more quantitative, mechanistic comparisons of artificial and real meat. Our automated-model-discovery based approach has the potential to inform the design of more authentic meat substitutes with an improved perception of taste, with the ultimate goal to reduce environmental impact, improve animal welfare, and mitigate climate change, while still offering the familiar taste and texture of traditional meat.

ID INCENTIVE MECHANISM; MOBILE BLOCKCHAIN; ENABLED INTERNET; MANAGEMENT
AB Blockchain came to prominence as the distributed ledger underneath Bitcoin, which protects the transaction histories in a fully-connected, peer-to-peer network. The blockchain mining process requires high computing power to solve a Proof-of-Work (PoW) puzzle, which is hard to implement on users' mobile devices. So these miners may leverage the edge/cloud service providers (ESPs/CSP) to calculate the PoW puzzle. The existing edge-assisted blockchain networks assumed that all ESPs have a uniform propagation delay, which is unrealistic. In this article, we consider a more practical scene where ESPs locate in diverse positions of the blockchain network, which causes different propagation delays when supporting the computation of the PoW puzzle. Additionally, these ESPs connect to a remote CSP for resource scheduling when the computing tasks exceed their maximum capacity. The blockchain mining process generally involves complicated competition and games among CSP, ESPs, and miners. Each service provider focuses on how to determine his resource price so that he can maximize his utility. According to the set resource price, each miner concentrates on scheduling his resource requests for each ESP to maximize individual personal utility, which depends on ESPs' resource price and propagation delays. We first model such a resource pricing and scheduling problem as a three-stage multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game and aim at finding the Stackelberg equilibrium. Then, we analyze the subgame optimization problem in each stage and propose an iterative algorithm based on backward induction to achieve the Nash equilibrium of the Stackelberg game. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to verify the significant performance of the proposed solution.

AB Ethnic-racial discrimination, the differential treatment of individuals based on ethnic or racial group membership, predicts poor mental health outcomes such as anxiety. This is supported by long-standing theories on the social determinants of health and minority stress. However, these theories are rarely expanded to neurobiological sciences, limiting our understanding of mechanisms underlying observed associations. One potential neurobiological pathway between ethnic-racial discrimination exposure and anxiety is that ongoing exposure to racially charged encounters presents imminent threats that may modify stress-sensitive neurocircuitry, like the amygdala.The current study evaluated whether amygdala volume mediated associations between ethnic-racial discrimination exposure and anxiety symptoms in Latina girls, a group exhibiting heightened levels of untreated anxiety and disproportionately subjected to ethnic-racial discrimination.Thirty predominantly Mexican-identifying Latina girls residing in Southern California (M Age = 9.76, SD = 1.11 years) completed a T1-weighted structural MRI scan. Using the Perceptions of Racism in Children and Youth, participants self-reported the prevalence and severity of various discriminatory experiences. Participants also self-reported their anxiety symptoms via the Screen for Child Anxiety and Related Emotional Disorders. Controlling for total intracranial volume and annual household income, an indirect effect of ethnic-racial discrimination on anxiety symptoms via left amygdala volume was observed, beta = -0.28, SE = 0.17, BC 95% CI [-0.690, -0.017]. The current findings suggest that the left amygdala is sensitive to racialized threats in childhood and that stress-related alterations may, in part, contribute to elevated anxiety in Latina girls. Our data elucidate a potential mechanism by which this form of sociocultural stress can adversely impact mental health, particularly in the transition from middle childhood to early adolescence, a period marked by a host of interlinked neurophysiological and social changes.
   Ethnische oder rassistische Diskriminierung, d. h. die unterschiedliche Behandlung von Menschen aufgrund rassistischer oder ethnisch-diskriminierender Zuschreibungen von Gruppenzugehorigkeiten, ist mit schadlichen Folgen fur die psychische Gesundheit assoziiert. Langjahrige Theorien zu den sozialen Determinanten der Gesundheit und Minderheitenstress unterstutzen solche Beobachtungen. Diese Theorien werden jedoch selten in die neurobiologischen Wissenschaften erweitert, was unser Verstandnis von Mechanismen einschrankt. Ein moglicher neurobiologischer Pfad zwischen Diskriminierungserfahrungen und Angststorungen ist, dass die standige Bedrohung rassistisch motivierter Begegnungen stressempfindliche neuronale Schaltkreise des Gehirns, wie zum Beispiel die Amygdala, verandern kann.In dieser Studie wurde untersucht, ob das Amygdala-Volumen eine vermittelnde Rolle zwischen ethnisch-rassistischen Diskriminierungserfahrungen und Angstsymptomen von Latina-Madchen spielt. Latina-Madchen haben oft erhohte Angststorungen und sind in den Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika haufig ethnischer und rassistischer Diskriminierung ausgesetzt.Dreissig uberwiegend mexikanisch identifizierte Latina-Madchen aus Sudkalifornien (M = 9,76, SD = 1,11 Jahre) nahmen an einem T1-gewichteten strukturellen MRI-Scan teil. Teilnehmerinnen berichteten uber die Pravalenz und Schwierigkeit verschiedener diskriminierender Erfahrungen. Sie berichteten auch uber ihre Angstsymptome. Beobachtet wurde eine indirekte Auswirkung ethnisch-rassistischer Diskriminierung auf Angstsymptome uber das Volumen der linken Amygdala (beta = -0,28, SE = 0,17, BC 95 % KI [-0,690, -0,017]), nach Kontrolle des gesamten intrakraniellen Volumens und des jahrlichen Haushaltseinkommens. Diese Erkenntnisse deuten darauf hin, dass die linke Amygdala empfindlich auf rassistische Bedrohungen reagiert und dass stressbedingte Veranderungen bei Latina-Madchen teilweise zu erhohter Angst beitragen konnen. Unsere Daten verdeutlichen einen moglichen Mechanismus, durch den diese Form von soziokulturellem Stress sich negativ auf die psychische Gesundheit auswirkt, insbesondere wahrend der mittleren Kindheit bis zur fruhen Adoleszenz, einer Zeitspanne, die von einer Vielzahl miteinander verbundener neurophysiologischer und sozialer Veranderungen gepragt ist.

TI Semantically preserving adversarial unsupervised domain adaptation
   network for improving disease recognition from chest x-rays
SO COMPUTERIZED MEDICAL IMAGING AND GRAPHICS
LA English
DT Article
DE Unsupervised domain adaptation; Adversarial reconstruction; Semantic
   consistency; Chest x-ray (CXR)
AB Supervised deep learning methods have been successfully applied in medical imaging. However, training deep learning systems often requires ample annotated data. Due to cost and time restrictions, not all collected medical images, e.g., chest x-rays (CXRs), can be labeled in practice. To classify these unlabeled images, a solution may involve adopting a model trained with sufficient labeled data in relevant domains (with both source and target being CXRs). However, domain shift may cause the trained model not able to generalize well on unlabeled target datasets. This work aims to develop a novel unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) framework to improve recognition performance on unlabeled target data. We present a semantically preserving adversarial UDA network, i.e., SPA-UDA net, with the potential to bridge the domain gap, by reconstructing the images in the target domain via an adversarial encode-and-reconstruct translation architecture. To preserve the class-specific semantic information (i.e., with or without disease) of the original images when translating, a semantically consistent framework is embedded. This framework is designed to guarantee that fine-grained disease-related information on the original images can be safely transferred. Furthermore, the proposed SPA-UDA net does not require paired images from source and target domains when training, which reduces the cost of arranging data significantly and is ideal for UDA. We evaluate the proposed SPA-UDA net on two public CXR datasets for lung disease recognition. The experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves significant performance improvements compared to other state-of-the-art UDA methods.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Bilevel optimization has become a powerful tool in a wide variety of machine learning problems. However, the current nonconvex bilevel optimization considers an offline dataset and static functions, which may not work well in emerging online applications with streaming data and time-varying functions. In this work, we study online bilevel optimization (OBO) where the functions can be time-varying and the agent continuously updates the decisions with online streaming data. To deal with the function variations and the unavailability of the true hypergradients in OBO, we propose a single-loop online bilevel optimizer with window averaging (SOBOW), which updates the outer-level decision based on a window average of the most recent hypergradient estimations stored in the memory. Compared to existing algorithms, SOBOW is computationally efficient and does not need to know previous functions. To handle the unique technical difficulties rooted in single-loop update and function variations for OBO, we develop a novel analytical technique that disentangles the complex couplings between decision variables, and carefully controls the hypergradient estimation error. We show that SOBOW can achieve a sublinear bilevel local regret under mild conditions. Extensive experiments across multiple domains corroborate the effectiveness of SOBOW.

AB Large spatial datasets with many spatial covariates have become ubiquitous in many fields in recent years. A question of interest is to identify which covariates are likely to influence a spatial response, and whether and how the effects of these covariates vary across space, including potential abrupt changes from region to region. To solve this question, a new efficient regularized spatially clustered coefficient (RSCC) regression approach is proposed, which could achieve variable selection and identify latent spatially heterogeneous covariate effects with clustered patterns simultaneously. By carefully designing the regularization term of RSCC as a chain graph guided fusion penalty plus a group lasso penalty, the RSCC model is computationally efficient for large spatial datasets while still achieving the theoretical guarantees for estimation. RSCC also adopts the idea of adaptive learning to allow for adaptive weights and adaptive graphs in its regularization terms and further improves the estimation performance. RSCC is applied to study the acceptance of COVID19 vaccines using county-level data in the United States and discover the determinants of vaccination acceptance with varying effects across counties, revealing important withinstate and across-state spatially clustered patterns of covariates effects.

ID NUMERICAL-SIMULATION; DRAFT TUBE; PERFORMANCE; DEFLECTION; GEOMETRY;

AB Spouted bed instabilities, such as spout deflection and spout oscillation, are well understood to decrease the particle recirculation rate, which decreases drying and mixing efficiency. A recent study (Punch et al., Chem. Eng. J., 2024 495, 153459) showed that vertical vibration could be used to decrease spout instabilities in dry and wet spouted beds at low bed height for large particles, without compromising recirculation rate. Here, we show experimentally that vertical vibration can also be used to reduce spout instabilities for spouted beds of dry particles with a large inlet diameter to particle diameter ratio (>20), which are traditionally highly unstable, and present a regime map to guide scale-up of industrial vibrated spouted beds. Numerical CFD-DEM simulations are used to elucidate the mechanisms of vertically vibrated spouted beds and reveal that vertical vibration produces a force wave each vibration cycle which propagates vertically through the bed and homogenizes the particle recirculation rate into the spout, mitigating spout instabilities.

ID PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
AB In this paper, we investigate frequency shift keying (FSK) over ambient orthogonal frequency division multiplexed (OFDM) signals. By cycling through a sequence of antenna loads providing different phase shifts at the tag, we are able to unidirectionally shift the ambient OFDM spectrum either up or down in frequency to disjoint subsets of the subcarriers allowing the implementation of FSK. We exploit the guard bands and the orthogonality of the OFDM subcarriers to avoid both direct-link and adjacent channel interference. Different from energy detection based techniques that suffer from asymmetric error probabilities and rely on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) dependent detection thresholds, the proposed scheme has symmetric error probabilities and allows simple detection without the need for a threshold. We present both binary and four-ary schemes, and analyze the error performance of the optimal noncoherent detectors. For the binary scheme, we obtain exact expressions for the average probability of error, while for the four-ary scheme, a union bound is used to characterize the error performance. Single and multi-antenna receivers are considered, and their performance is analyzed. Finally, we present simulation results to corroborate our analysis and investigate the effects of multiple system parameters. The results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the baseline energy detection based schemes available in the literature in various scenarios by up to 5 dB.

ID MOTION; FRAMEWORK; MODEL
AB This paper presents a novel approach, termed Temporal Latent Residual Network (TLRN), to predict a sequence of deformation fields in time-series image registration. The challenge of registering time-series images often lies in the occurrence of large motions, especially when images differ significantly from a reference (e.g., the start of a cardiac cycle compared to the peak stretching phase). To achieve accurate and robust registration results, we leverage the nature of motion continuity and exploit the temporal smoothness in consecutive image frames. Our proposed TLRN highlights a temporal residual network with residual blocks carefully designed in latent deformation spaces, which are parameterized by time-sequential initial velocity fields. We treat a sequence of residual blocks over time as a dynamic training system, where each block is designed to learn the residual function between desired deformation features and current input accumulated from previous time frames. We validate the effectivenss of TLRN on both synthetic data and real-world cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) image videos. Our experimental results shows that TLRN is able to achieve substantially improved registration accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/nellie689/TLRN.

AB Although the potential for cities and regions to contribute to global mitigation efforts is widely acknowledged, there is little evidence on the effectiveness of subnational mitigation strategies. Here we address this gap through a systematic review of 234 quantitative mitigation case studies. We use a meta-analytical approach to estimate expected greenhouse gas emissions reductions from 12 categories of mitigation strategies. We find that strategies related to land use and development, circular economy, and waste management are most effective and reliable for reducing emissions. The results demonstrate that cities and regions are taking widespread action to reduce emissions. However, we find misalignment between the strategies that policymakers and researchers focus on, compared to those with the highest expected impacts. The results inform climate action planning at the city and regional level and the evaluation of subnational climate targets.
   Land use and development, circular economy, and waste management are the most effective climate change mitigation strategies in cities and regions, but policy choices are not always aligned with impact, according to a meta-analysis of 234 subnational case studies.

AB Purpose: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology detects specific mutations that can provide treatment opportunities for colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Patients and Methods: We analyzed the mutation frequencies of common actionable genes and their association with clinicopathological characteristics and oncologic outcomes using targeted NGS in 107 Saudi Arabian patients without a family history of CRC. Results: Approximately 98% of patients had genetic alterations. Frequent mutations were observed in BRCA2 (79%), CHEK1 (78%), ATM (76%), PMS2 (76%), ATR (74%), and MYCL (73%). The APC gene was not included in the panel. Statistical analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model revealed an unusual positive association between poorly differentiated tumors and survival rates (p = 0.025). Although no significant univariate associations between specific mutations or overall mutation rate and overall survival were found, our preliminary analysis of the molecular markers for CRC in a predominantly Arab population can provide insights into the molecular pathways that play a significant role in the underlying disease progression. Conclusions: These results may help optimize personalized therapy when drugs specific to a patient's mutation profile have already been developed.

TI The afterglow of GW170817 from every angle: prospects for detecting the

AB To date GW170817, produced by a binary neutron star (BNS) merger, is the only gravitational wave (GW) event with an electromagnetic counterpart. It was associated with a prompt short gamma-ray burst (GRB), an optical kilonova, and the afterglow of a structured off-axis relativistic jet. We model the prospects for future mergers discovered in gravitational waves to produce detectable afterglows. Using a model fit to GW170817, we assume all BNS mergers produce jets with the same parameters, and model the afterglow luminosity for a full distribution of observer angles, ISM densities, and distances. We find that in the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA O4 run, 30 per cent-45 per cent of BNS mergers with a well-localized counterpart will have an afterglow detectable with current instrumentation in the X-ray, radio and optical. Without a previously detected counterpart, 10 per cent-15 per cent will have an afterglow detectable by wide-area radio and optical surveys, compared to only about 5 per cent-12 per cent of events expected to have bright (on-axis) gamma-ray emission. Most afterglows that are detected will be from off-axis jets. Further in the future, in the A + era (O5), 40 per cent-50 per cent of mergers will have afterglows detectable with next-generation X-ray and radio instruments. Future wide-area radio survey instruments, particularly DSA-2000, could detect 40 per cent of afterglows, even without a kilonova counterpart. Finding and monitoring these afterglows will provide valuable insight into the structure and diversity of relativistic jets, the rate at which mergers produce jets, and constrain the angle of the mergers relative to our line of sight.

AB Neural operators have been applied in various scientific fields, such as solving parametric partial differential equations, dynamical systems with control, and inverse problems. However, challenges arise when dealing with input functions that exhibit heterogeneous properties, requiring multiple sensors to handle functions with minimal regularity. To address this issue, discretization-invariant neural operators have been used, allowing the sampling of diverse input functions with different sensor locations. However, existing frameworks still require an equal number of sensors for all functions. We propose a novel distributed approach to further relax the discretization requirements and solve the heterogeneous dataset challenges. Our method involves partitioning the input function space and processing individual input functions using independent and separate neural networks. A centralized neural network is used to handle shared information across all output functions. This distributed methodology reduces the number of gradient descent back -propagation steps, improving efficiency while maintaining accuracy. We demonstrate that the corresponding neural network is a universal approximator of continuous nonlinear operators and present three numerical examples to validate its performance.

ID LEVEL SET FORMULATION; AIR ENTRAINMENT; FREE-SURFACE
AB Two-phase flows involving the dynamic interaction of gas and liquid phases are fundamental to both natural and industrial systems. A critical phenomenon in these flows is bubble fragmentation, which affects interfacial area and mass/momentum transfer. Direct numerical simulations (DNS) of turbulent two-phase bubbly flows allow for improved control of physical parameters and access to local flow variables that are challenging to obtain from traditional experiments. In this work, we perform numerical experiments of bubble breakup in decaying isotropic turbulence, at moderate Weber number regimes. By analyzing the interfacial strain rate and turbulent kinetic energy exchange, we provide new insights into the interplay between turbulence and bubble breakup dynamics. Different bubble sizes around the integral scale are simulated for a fixed bubble Weber number, which defines the ratio of turbulent and surface tension forces, maintaining the level of deformability. Results reveal that bubbles closest to the turbulence integral scale have the highest deformation levels and are most efficient in extracting energy from the flow. Smaller bubbles show the least amount of deformation and are unable to capture energy from the larger eddies, in agreement with the Kolmogorov-Hinze hypothesis.

AB The human limb possesses a remarkable capacity to absorb energy during physical human-robot interaction (pHRI), which can be quantified as the biomechanical "Excess of Passivity" (EoP) using non-linear control theory. This biomechanical passivity index can be used to reduce conservatism and increase the transparency of pHRI stabilizers. Previous work on EoP has used system identification techniques to compute EoP offline. However, for use in real-time controllers, an instantaneous method for EoP estimation would be desired. This paper hypothesizes that muscle fatigue can potentially be a complicating factor which can cumulatively affect the ability of human biomechanics to absorb mechanical energy over time during physical interaction with robots. In this work, we focused on the energetic behavior of the human wrist during pHRI, and, for the first time, we investigated the effect of fatigue on EoP. The EoP for five participants was computed throughout one hundred-second trials of high-frequency wrist perturbations in four directions. Subjects maintained a stiff and consistent grip throughout each trial, causing an accumulation of fatigue in the forearm muscles. Muscle activity was recorded using an array of sixteen sEMG sensors. It was found that the EoP degraded (in a statistically significant manner) with increased muscle fatigue in all directions, even when the level of muscle co-contraction was controlled consistently through a visual myofeedback mechanism. 100% of the subjects exhibited this decline in energy absorption capacity in all directions studied. The median drop in EoP after one-hundred seconds of perturbation was 11% for trials in the abduction and adduction directions and 22% in the pronation and supination directions. These results indicate a need for more robust estimation methods or new modalities to account for muscle fatigue in the control architectures of physical human-robot interaction.

AB Nitric acid (HNO3) is a critical commodity chemical produced on an enormous scale via oxidation of ammonia NH3 in the Ostwald process and, as such, is responsible for a significant fraction of global greenhouse gas emissions. Formation of nitric acid by direct oxidation of dinitrogen via the electrochemical nitrogen oxidation reaction (N2OR) is an attractive alternative but has so far largely remained elusive. Toward advancing our fundamental understanding of the limitations of the N2OR, in this article, we investigated the competitive adsorption dynamics of nitrogen (N-2) and water oxidation intermediates such as hydroxide (OH) on a range of transition metal oxides. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we explore three possible N2OR mechanisms: direct adsorption and dissociative adsorption of N-2, and a Mars-van Krevelen (MvK)-type mechanism involving the adsorption of N-2 on a surface-bound atomic oxygen. We observed a strong linear scaling relation between the adsorption energy of N-2 and OH on the metal-terminated transition metal oxide, suggesting that under typical highly oxidizing operating conditions for the N2OR (U-RHE > 1.24 V), water oxidation intermediates such as OH are likely to dominate the surface, leading to vanishingly small coverage of adsorbed N-2. From this result, we find that direct or dissociative adsorption of N-2 is unlikely, suggesting an MvK-type mechanism for the N2OR. Probing this mechanism further using DFT, we find that the reaction energetics are largely less favorable than water oxidation due to the high activation barrier for N-2 adsorption, which we find to be the rate-determining step for the process. Our experimental results corroborate these findings with the majority of tested catalysts exhibiting poor N2OR selectivity and a rate-determining step involving N-2(g). However, dynamic potential control emerged as a possible strategy to enhance N2OR activity as it may limit the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and promote N-2 adsorption. This work underscores the challenges in achieving efficient N2OR, highlighting the need for unconventional catalyst designs and operational strategies, such as electrolyte engineering and dynamic potential control, to overcome the inherent kinetic and thermodynamic barriers.

AB Much of the profound interspecific variation in genome content has been attributed to transposable elements (TEs). To explore the extent of TE variation within species, we developed an optimized open-source algorithm, panEDTA, to de novo annotate TEs in a pangenome context. We then generated a unified TE annotation for a maize pangenome derived from 26 reference-quality genomes, which reveals an excess of 35.1 Mb of TE sequences per genome in tropical maize relative to temperate maize. A small number (n = 216) of TE families, mainly LTR retrotransposons, drive these differences. Evidence from the methylome, transcriptome, LTR age distribution, and LTR insertional polymorphisms reveals that 64.7% of the variability is contributed by LTR families that are young, less methylated, and more expressed in tropical maize, whereas 18.5% is driven by LTR families with removal or loss in temperate maize. Additionally, we find enrichment for Young LTR families adjacent to nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat (NLR) clusters of varying copy number across lines, suggesting TE activity may be associated with disease resistance in maize.

AB Hybrid halide perovskites AM(II)X(3) (A = ammonium cation, M-II = divalent cation, X = Cl, Br, I) have been extensively studied but have only previously been reported for the divalent carbon group elements Ge, Sn, and Pb. While they have displayed an impressive range of optoelectronic properties, the instability of Ge-II and Sn-II and the toxicity of Pb have stimulated significant interest in finding alternatives to these carbon group-based perovskites. Here, we describe the low-temperature solid-state synthesis of five new hybrid iodide perovskites centered around divalent alkaline earth and lanthanide elements, with the general formula AM(II)I(3) (A = methylammonium, MA; M-II = Sr, Sm, Eu, and A = formamidinium, FA; M-II = Sr, Eu). Structural, calorimetric, optical, photoluminescence, and magnetic properties of these materials are reported.

DE additive manufacturing; thermoset material; wavenumber analysis;
   dispersion curve; mechanical properties characterization
AB Thermoset materials have begun to be applied in additive composite manufacturing due to their ability to withstand high temperatures without losing structural integrity. Meanwhile, the characterization of mechanical properties for additively manufactured composites is critical for ensuring material reliability and safety. However, traditional testing methods struggle to accurately and nondestructively characterize additively manufactured composites due to challenges posed by curing processes, microstructural variability, anisotropic properties of thermoset composites, and the risk of damaging these materials during evaluation. For characterizing the mechanical properties of additive-manufactured thermoset composites, this paper presents a novel method that combines a nondestructive PZT- LDV guided wave sensing system and a wavenumber analysis that fuses multidimensional Fourier transform with dispersion curve regression. For proof of concept, we performed an experiment using our method to measure a 3D-printed thermoset composite panel. Based on our nondestructive approach, two material properties (shear wave velocity and Poisson's ratio) in multiple directions were successfully determined for the tested panel. We expect this research to introduce a non-contact and efficient method for characterizing various composites and monitoring their property changes after additive manufacturing.

To address the knowledge gap in chemical recycling, we introduce a 2-part laboratory experiment that was conducted in multiple high schools and public outreach events to demonstrate the depolymerization of PET via aminolysis and the remanufacturing of cleaved PET fragments into a new aramid polymer. Student experiences were evaluated with two postlab assignments.

ID POLY(PHENYLENE OXIDE); AMINATION
AB Poly(arylene ether)s (PAEs) are a versatile class of thermoplastic materials with commercial importance. Currently their synthesis relies predominantly on either nucleophilic or electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions, severely limiting the scope of available PAEs. Herein, we report the copper(II)-catalyzed polycondensation of electronically unactivated aryl bromides with bisphenols to afford a wide range of new PAEs. These PAEs are characterized by their thermal and mechanical properties. Functional PAEs were produced that have reversible acid- and redox-triggered chromophores incorporated into the backbone, which illustrates the utility of these methods.

Here, we present our spatial transcriptomics analysis framework, MUSTANG (MUlti-sample Spatial Transcriptomics data ANalysis with cross-sample transcriptional similarity Guidance), which is capable of performing multi-sample spatial transcriptomics spot cellular deconvolution by allowing both cross-sample expression-based similarity information sharing as well as spatial correlation in gene expression patterns within samples. Experiments on a semi-synthetic spatial transcriptomics dataset and three real-world spatial transcriptomics datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MUSTANG in revealing biological insights inherent in the cellular characterization of tissue samples under study.

DE sustainable agriculture; NSF CASFER; translation of research into
   markets
AB One of the most difficult challenges in translating electrochemical technologies into agriculture is the lag in education about the impact of electrochemical technologies in the field. Other challenges include lack of (1) investment and resources for translational research; (2) effective mechanisms to derisk investment; (3) a workforce prepared to translate and operate such technologies; (4) policy, legal infrastructure, and holistic business growth models; and (5) diverse and inclusive leadership "agents of change" to transition the technologies into the market. Opportunities to translate research into the market require strong partnerships with industry, universities, government, and stakeholders. An effective model is the National Science Foundation (NSF) Engineering Research Center (ERC) model. An NSF ERC Gen-4 launched in August 2022 is the Center for Advancing Sustainable and Distributed Fertilizer Production (CASFER). Industry and other practitioner organizations are actively involved at the very early stage (articulation of the vision) and during operation in activities such as: participation in strategic planning, joint research, providing input into workforce development programs, mentoring students, and engagement in proof-of-concept testbeds. All these activities and engagement are key to accelerating technology transfer and to transitioning technologies from the lab to the market, while training an effective workforce for industry.

AB The effects of different dielectric outcoupling layers on top-emitting perovskite light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are studied. The ability to manipulate light output via index of refraction and thickness variation of the outcoupling layer is demonstrated, leading to 27.7% improvement in external quantum efficiency (EQE) compared to devices without added outcoupling dielectric layers. Optimal dielectric thicknesses are able to be resolved for EQE enhancement across three outcoupling materials with different refractive indices. Optical simulations are shown to agree well with experimental results and allow for future optimization for various perovskite compositions with different emission spectra.

AB Dual process theories of creativity suggest that creative thought is supported by both a generation phase, where unconstrained ideas are generated and combined in novel ways, and an evaluation phase, where those ideas are filtered for usefulness in context. Neurocognitively, both the default mode network (DMN) and the executive control network (ECN) have been implicated in generation and evaluation, respectively. Importantly, generating and evaluating ideas implies that the same information, reflected in patterns of neural activity, must be present in both phases, suggesting that information should be 'reinstated' (i.e. multidimensional patterns must reappear) within and/or between network nodes. In the present study, we used representational similarity analysis (RSA) to investigate the extent to which nodes of the DMN and ECN reinstate information between a generation phase, in which participants generated novel or appropriate word associations to single nouns, and an evaluation phase, where we presented the associations back to participants to evaluate them. We showed strong evidence for reinstatement within the ECN dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex during the novel association task, and within the DMN medial prefrontal cortex during the appropriate association task. We additionally showed between network reinstatement between the ECN dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex and the DMN posterior parietal cortex during the novelty task. These results demonstrate the importance of both within- and between-informational reinstatement for generating and evaluating ideas, and implicate both the DMN and ECN in dual process models of creativity.

AB Variation in prefrontal cortex neuroanatomy has been previously associated with elevated physiological responses to anticipated aversive events. The extent to which such associations extend beyond the specific ecology of treatment-seeking youth from upper- middle socioeconomic backgrounds is unknown. The current study tests the replicability of neuroanatomical correlates of anticipatory responding and the moderating roles of age and anxiety severity in a community sample of Latina girls, a historically underrepresented group exhibiting high levels of untreated anxiety. Forty pre-adolescent Latina girls (M-Age = 10.01, s.d. =1.25, range = 8-12 years) completed a structural magnetic resonance imaging scan. Participants also completed a differential threat and safety learning paradigm, during which skin conductance and subjective fear responding were assessed. Anxiety severity was assessed via the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders. Ventromedial prefrontal cortex thickness was associated with reduced physiological responsivity to anticipated threat. Age- and anxiety-dependent associations emerged between dorsomedial prefrontal cortex thickness and individual differences in subjective fear responding to anticipated threat. This preliminary study extends work on neuroanatomical contributions to physiological threat responsivity to a community sample of Latina youth and highlights potential considerations for early identification efforts in this population when threat neurocircuitry is still developing.

AB Aluminum-doped porous silicon was produced by a molten salt reaction. It showed accelerated lithium-ion diffusion kinetics and excellent structural stability. The pSi-Al significantly reduced the charge/ion transport resistance and first lithium capture by Al doping. It also affected the generation of the SEI during cycling and promoted the formation of LiF. The achieved ICE was 90.57% and the initial reversible capacity was 2860 mA h g-1. Moreover, the reversible capacity was 1765 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at 1 A g-1, which demonstrated good electrochemical performance.

AB The assimilation of radar reflectivity requires an accurate and efficient forward operator that links the model state variables to radar observations. In this study, newly developed parameterized forward operators (PFO) for radar reflectivity with a new continuous melting model are implemented to assimilate observed radar data. To assess the impact of the novel parameterized reflectivity forward operators on convective storm analysis and forecasting, two distinct sets of cycled assimilation and forecast experiments are conducted. One set of experiments (ExpRFO) uses a conventional Rayleigh-scattering-approximation-based forward operator (RFO) with hydrometeor classification, while the other uses the PFO (ExpPFO_New) for radar reflectivity with a new continuous melting model. Eight high-impact severe convective weather events from the Hazardous Weather Testbed (HWT) 2019 Spring Experiments are selected for this study. The analysis and forecast results are first examined in detail for a classic tornadic supercell case on 24 May 2019, with the potential benefits provided by the PFO then evaluated for all eight cases. It is demonstrated that ExpPFO_New provides more robust results in terms of improving the short-term severe weather forecasts. Compared to ExpRFO, ExpPFO_New better reproduces all observed supercells in the analysis field, yields a more continuous and reasonable reflectivity distribution near the melting layer, and improves the strength of the cold pool compared to observations. Overall, ExpPFO_New, initialized from the more accurate analysis fields, produces better forecasts of reflectivity and hourly precipitation with smaller biases, especially at heavy precipitation thresholds.

TI The value of manual annotation in assessing trends of hate speech on

SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE

AB In recent years, there has been a growing interest in research on hate speech on social media. However, researchers face many challenges in producing meaningful results and must develop innovative methods to keep pace with the rapidly evolving nature of this field. How can we effectively determine the prevalence of specific types of hate speech on a given platform? What approaches can we employ to assess whether there has been an increase or decrease in content that can be classified as hate speech? Using the context of Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter, a period characterized by media reports suggesting a surge in antisemitism on the platform, we explore a range of qualitative and quantitative computational methods. Our analysis reveals that, starting from October 9, 2022, the usage of the term "Jews" on Twitter nearly doubled compared to the preceding period. Additionally, there was a sudden spike in the use of the term "K***s." However, the question arises: how indicative are these trends of a rise in antisemitism on that platform? We demonstrate that relying solely on keyword-based timelines can be misleading. Nevertheless, when utilized alongside corroborating timelines incorporating additional keywords identified through word frequency analysis, they can serve as powerful tools for content estimation. Nonetheless, it is crucial to supplement these approaches with interpretative methods to validate assumptions based on timelines. By employing a triangulation of methods encompassing descriptive analysis, such as timelines, word and retweet frequency analysis, and manual interpretation and labeling of representative samples, we uncover that discussions about Jews on Twitter during a turbulent 5-week period were predominantly centered around antisemitism. However, these discussions took various forms, including expressing concerns about the increase in antisemitism, denouncing antisemitism, remembering the Holocaust, refuting accusations of antisemitism, and even promoting antisemitic ideologies. We observe a significant escalation in both the volume and the proportion of antisemitic tropes within these conversations, particularly evident in late October 2022. This increase can be attributed to three triggering events that might have been overlooked when drawing conclusions solely from a simplistic timeline analysis of the term "Jews" or targeted slurs. In conclusion, we advocate for a mixed-methods approach where quantitative computational tools are complemented by qualitative discourse analysis. This combination is essential for comprehensively examining trends in complex content such as hate speech. Additionally, the integration of "manual" observation and labeling of representative data samples proves particularly valuable for distinguishing between instances of hate speech and the act of calling out such speech.

ID INCORRECT INFORMATION; AGE; SINGLE; AOI
AB In this paper, we study a sampling problem where a source takes samples from a Wiener process and transmits them through a wireless channel to a remote estimator. Due to channel fading, interference, and potential collisions, the packet transmissions are unreliable and could take random time durations. Our objective is to devise an optimal causal sampling policy that minimizes the long-term average mean square estimation error. This optimal sampling problem is a recursive optimal stopping problem, which is generally quite difficult to solve. However, we prove that the optimal sampling strategy is, in fact, a simple threshold policy where a new sample is taken whenever the instantaneous estimation error exceeds a threshold. This threshold remains a constant value that does not vary over time. By exploring the structure properties of the recursive optimal stopping problem, a low-complexity iterative algorithm is developed to compute the optimal threshold. This work generalizes previous research by incorporating both transmission errors and random transmission times into remote estimation. Numerical simulations are provided to compare our optimal policy with the zero-wait and age-optimal policies.

AB LowEarth orbit (LEO) satellite network can complement terrestrial networks for achieving global wireless coverage and improving delay-sensitive Internet services. This paper proposes an integrated satellite-terrestrial network (ISTN) architecture to provide ground users with seamless and reliable content delivery services. For optimal service provisioning in this architecture, we formulate an optimization model to maximize the network throughput by jointly optimizing content delivery policy, cache placement, and transmission power allocation. The resulting optimization model is a large-scale mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) that is intractable for classical computer solvers. Inspired by quantum computing techniques, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical generalized Benders' decomposition (HQCGBD) algorithm to address this challenge. Specifically, we first exploit the generalized Benders' decomposition (GBD) to decompose the problem into a master problem and a subproblem and then leverage the state-of-the-art quantum annealer to solve the challenging master problem. Furthermore, a multi-cut strategy is designed in HQCGBD to accelerate the solution process by leveraging the quantum advantages in parallel computing. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed HQCGBD algorithm and validate the effectiveness of the proposed cache-enabled ISTN architecture.

ID GLOBAL-SCALE OBSERVATIONS
AB Using NASA's Global-scale Observations of the Limb and Disk (GOLD) imager, we report nightside ionospheric changes during the G5 super geomagnetic storm of 10 and 11 May 2024. Specifically, the nightside southern crest of the Equatorial Ionization Anomaly (EIA) was observed to merge with the aurora near the southern tip of South America. During the storm, the EIA southern crest was seen moving poleward as fast as 450 m/s. Furthermore, the aurora extended to mid-latitudes reaching the southern tips of Africa and South America. The poleward shift of the equatorial ionospheric structure and equatorward motion of the aurora means there was no mid-latitude ionosphere in this region. These observations offer unique insights into the ionospheric response to extreme geomagnetic disturbances, highlighting the complex interplay between solar activity and Earth's upper atmosphere.
   On Earth's nightside during the super geomagnetic storm that occurred on 10 May 2024, NASA's GOLD imager saw something new: a part of Earth's ionosphere, the southern peak of what typically appears as a double-peaked structure in the ionospheric density at equatorial and low latitudes, merged with the aurora near the southern tip of South America. This has never been reported before. Additionally, the boundary of the aurora expanded further equatorward than usual. These observations of what happened in the Earth's ionosphere during this super storm are reported for the first time in this study.
   EIA crests between similar to 70 degrees and 35 degrees W moved poleward, with northern and southern crest reaching similar to 38 degrees N and similar to 35 degrees S Mlat in the American sector Southern EIA crest moved poleward with a speed of similar to 450 m/s near similar to 55 degrees W Glon during strong IMF Bz and d(Dst)/dt First observation of the merging of an EIA crest with the aurora indicating no mid-latitude ionosphere

AB The seeded crystal growth of LiNbO 3 in glass under the isothermal conditions has been studied using a machinelearned clustering algorithm trained on a combination of static and dynamic structural features. Our findings contradict the sharp crystal-glass interface assumption of classical nucleation theory (CNT). The growth of the seed occurs via the attachment of a group of atoms rather than single atoms. The predictions from the machine-learned simulations helped us compare the growth rate of seeds across various initial seed-sizes and temperature. Simulations with multiple seeds show that the growth rate of a seed is enhanced by the presence of another seed in its vicinity.

AB Molecules cooled to ultracold temperatures are desirable for applications in fundamental physics and quantum information science. However, cooling polyatomic molecules with more than six atoms has not yet been achieved. Building on the idea of an optical cycling center (OCC), a moiety supporting a set of localized and isolated electronic states within a polyatomic molecule, molecules with two OCCs (bi-OCCs) may afford better cooling efficiency by doubling the photon scattering rate. By using quantum chemistry calculations, we assess the extent of the coupling of the two OCCs with each other and the molecular scaffold. We show that promising coolable bi-OCC molecules can be proposed by following chemical design principles.

AB Glioblastoma (GBM) presents a significant therapeutic challenge due to the limited efficacy of existing treatments. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy offers promise, but its potential in solid tumors like GBM is undermined by the physical barrier posed by the extracellular matrix (ECM). To address the inadequacies of traditional 2D cell culture, animal models, and Matrigel-based 3D culture in mimicking the mechanical characteristics of tumor tissues, we employed biomaterials and digital light processing-based 3D bioprinting to fabricate biomimetic tumor models with finely tunable ECM stiffness independent of ECM composition. Our results demonstrated that increased material stiffness markedly impeded CAR-T cell penetration and tumor cell cytotoxicity in GBM models. The 3D bioprinted models enabled us to examine the influence of ECM stiffness on CAR-T cell therapy effectiveness, providing a clinically pertinent evaluation tool for CAR-T cell development in stiff solid tumors. Furthermore, we developed an innovative heat-inducible CAR-T cell therapy, effectively overcoming the challenges posed by the stiff tumor microenvironment.

AB Biology uses an electron-based modality that involves reduction and oxidation (redox) reactions, and this redox modality has both molecular and electrical features. Importantly, the electrical features are accessible to convenient electrode measurements, but this electron-based redox modality is fundamentally different from biology's ion-based electrical modality that is prominent in neural and neuromuscular communication. Here, we review recent efforts to develop redox based bioelectronics for the acquisition of information and actuation of responses. Specifically, we illustrate how electrodes enable comparatively simple modulation/demodulation because electrodes readily transduce electrical inputs into redox-signals- in some cases, the same redox signals (i.e., reactive oxygen species; ROS) used by biology. The propagation of redox signals occurs through diffusion and reaction mechanisms involving redox reaction networks. We further describe how advanced biological methods (protein engineering and synthetic biology) are being used to enable a targeting of redox inputs to actuate specific responses at molecular (i.e., protein conjugation) and cellular (i.e., electrogenetic) levels. In summary, we envision that redox-based bioelectronics could enable entirely new opportunities for applying electronics to: provide new experimental approaches for the study of redox-biology; yield systems-level measurements for clinical practice; and facilitate a fusion of the information-processing capabilities of biology and electronics.

AB The past decade has witnessed a rapid growth of graphene plasmonics and their applications in different fields. Compared with conventional plasmonic materials, graphene enables highly confined plasmons with much longer lifetimes. Moreover, graphene plasmons work in an extended wavelength range, i.e., mid-infrared and terahertz regime, overlapping with the fingerprints of most organic and biomolecules, and have broadened their applications towards plasmonic biological and chemical sensors. In this review, we discuss intrinsic plasmonic properties of graphene and strategies both for tuning graphene plasmons as well as achieving higher performance by integrating graphene with plasmonic nanostructures. Next, we survey applications of graphene and graphene-hybrid materials in biosensors, chemical sensors, optical sensors, and sensors in other fields. Lastly, we conclude this review by providing a brief outlook and challenges of the field. Through this review, we aim to provide an overall picture of graphene plasmonic sensing and to suggest future trends of development of graphene plasmonics.

AB Hydrogels are hydrated three-dimensional networks of hydrophilic polymers that are commonly used in the biomedical industry due to their mechanical and structural tunability, biocompatibility, and similar water content to biological tissues. The surface structure of hydrogels polymerized through free-radical polymerization can be modified by controlling environmental oxygen concentrations, leading to the formation of a polymer concentration gradient. In this work, 17.5 wt % polyacrylamide hydrogels are polymerized in low (0.01 mol % O-2) and high (20 mol % O-2) oxygen environments, and their mechanical and tribological properties are characterized through microindentation, nanoindentation, and tribological sliding experiments. Without significantly reducing the elastic modulus of the hydrogel (E* approximate to 200 kPa), we demonstrate an order of magnitude reduction in friction coefficient (from mu = 0.021 +/- 0.006 to mu = 0.002 +/- 0.001) by adjusting polymerization conditions (e.g., oxygen concentration). A quantitative analytical model based on polyacrylamide chemistry and kinetics was developed to estimate the thickness and structure of the monomer conversion gradient, termed the "surface gel layer". We find that polymerizing hydrogels at high oxygen concentrations leads to the formation of a preswollen surface gel layer that is approximately five times thicker (t approximate to 50 mu m) and four times less concentrated (approximate to 6% monomer conversion) at the surface prior to swelling compared to low oxygen environments (t approximate to 10 mu m, approximate to 20% monomer conversion). Our model could be readily modified to predict the preswollen concentration profile of the polyacrylamide gel surface layer for any reaction conditions-monomer and initiator concentration, oxygen concentration, reaction time, and reaction media depth-or used to select conditions that correspond to a certain desired surface gel layer profile.

AB From a comparison of the known molecular stoichiometry and x-ray photoemission spectroscopy, it is evident that the Fe(III) spin crossover salt [Fe(qsal)2Ni(dmit)2] has a preferential surface termination with the Ni(dmit)2 moiety, where qsal = N(8quinolyl)salicylaldimine, and dmit2- = 1,3-dithiol-2-thione-4,5-dithiolato. This preferential surface termination leads to a significant surface to bulk core level shift for the Ni 2p x-ray photoemission core level, not seen in the corresponding Fe 2p core level spectra. A similar surface to bulk core level shift is seen in Pd 3d in the related [Fe(qsal)2]2Pd(dmit)2. Inverse photoemission spectroscopy, compared with the x-ray absorption spectra at the Ni-L3,2 edge provides some indication of the density of states resulting from the dmit2- = 1,3-dithiol-2-thione-4,5-dithiolato ligand unoccupied molecular orbitals and thus supports the evidence regarding surface termination in the Ni(dmit)2 moiety.

ID ATMOSPHERIC CO2
AB Anthropogenic carbondioxide (CO2) emissions are a major factor in global warming, requiring significant cuts to combat climate change. A crucial technology to reduce global CO(2 )concentration is direct air capture (DAC) of CO2. However, existing DAC techniques are expensive because of low CO2 concentrations, and they frequently rely on fossil fuel-based energy. In this article, we investigate how wind turbines can influence local CO2 levels and potentially collaborate with DAC and other technologies. To explore this idea, we performed large-eddy simulations using two 5 MW commercial-scale wind turbines. We incorporated realistic CO2 profiles collected from 13 different global locations across different seasons. The simulations were performed under neutral atmospheric boundary layer conditions. The results demonstrate that the wake recovery mechanism of a wind turbine promotes rapid mixing of CO2 both above and below the turbine blade tips in the wind turbine wake. In cases where the initial concentrations of CO2 were elevated above the turbine, downward entrainment of CO2 occurred. Conversely, when high concentrations of CO2 were present in the lower atmosphere, wind turbines facilitated a decrease in concentration at that layer by up to 138 kg/m within the intermediate wake (within 7 diameters) of the second turbine, T-2. These discoveries inspire further investigation into the potential synergies between wind turbines and DAC devices or local CO2 pollutant diverters, depending on the prevailing CO2 profile. Consequently, this article marks the initial showcase of wind turbines' capability to influence CO2 levels by creating an entrainment and removal effect.

ID VARIATIONAL-INEQUALITIES; CONVERGENCE
AB Coordinate descent methods are popular in machine learning and optimization for their simple sparse updates and excellent practical performance. In the context of large-scale sequential game solving, these same properties would be attractive, but until now no such methods were known, because the strategy spaces do not satisfy the typical separable block structure exploited by such methods. We present the first cyclic coordinate-descent-like method for the polytope of sequence-form strategies, which form the strategy spaces for the players in an extensive-form game (EFG). Our method exploits the recursive structure of the proximal update induced by what are known as dilated regularizers, in order to allow for a pseudo block-wise update. We show that our method enjoys a O(1/T) convergence rate to a two-player zero-sum Nash equilibrium, while avoiding the worst-case polynomial scaling with the number of blocks common to cyclic methods. We empirically show that our algorithm usually performs better than other state-of-the-art first-order methods (i.e., mirror prox), and occasionally can even beat CFR+, a state-of-the-art algorithm for numerical equilibrium computation in zero-sum EFGs. We then introduce a restarting heuristic for EFG solving. We show empirically that restarting can lead to speedups, sometimes huge, both for our cyclic method, as well as for existing methods such as mirror prox and predictive CFR+.

AB Electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) has garnered increasing attention as a pathway for converting a harmful pollutant (nitrate) into a value-added product (ammonia). However, high selectivity toward ammonia (NH3) is imperative for process viability. Optimizing proton availability near the catalyst is important for achieving selective NH3 production. Here, the aim is to systematically examine the impacts of proton availability on NO3RR selectivity in a bipolar membrane (BPM)-based membrane electrode assembly (MEA) system. The BPM generates a proton flux from the membrane toward the catalyst during electrolysis. Thus, the BPM-MEA system can modulate the proton flux during operation. The impact of interposer layers, proton scavenging electrolytes (CO32-), and catalyst configurations are also examined to identify which local microenvironments favor ammonia formation. It is found that a moderate proton supply allows for an increase in ammonia yield by 576% when compared to the standard MEA setup. This also results in a high selectivity of 26 (NH3 over NO2-) at an applied current density of 200 mA cm-2.
   High selectivity toward ammonia is vital for the feasibility of the electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR). This study employs a bipolar membrane-based membrane electrode assembly system to investigate the influence of proton availability on the selectivity of NO3RR. The results underscore the pivotal importance of moderate proton supply for achieving highly selective NH3 production in NO3RR. image

AB Polymer-grafted nanopores allow the control of pore permittivity, which can be exploited in many nanotechnological applications. Using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the effect of cosolvents on the structural properties and gating capability of poly-(ethylene oxide) (PEO) grafted gold nanopores filled with mixed cosolvent- aqueous solution. We found that all cosolvents, tetrahydrofuran (THF), ethanol, butanol, acetic acid (ATA), and isobutyric acid (IBA), adsorb onto the nanopore surface releasing water and leading to PEO desorption and expansion into the pore center. This can result in nanopore closure, which occurs at different concentrations depending on cosolvent: similar to 30 to 35 vol % for THF and butanol, which are predominantly excluded from the PEO layer, and similar to 50 vol % for ethanol, isobutyric, or acetic acids, which interact with PEO chains via hydrogen bonding. We show that further addition of THF or butanol can lead to nanopore reopening due to cosolvent aggregation at the nanopore center, compressing the PEO layer. A different mechanism for nanopore opening is found for low concentrations (5% by volume) of acetic and isobutyric acid, which can form hydrogen bonds with PEO and alter its hydration, resulting in a more compact chain conformation. Lateral water diffusion within the nanopore is shown to be mostly related to the open pore size, while cosolvent diffusion is also found to depend on hydrogen bonding with PEO and cosolvent hydrophobicity.

DE Phishing; Phishing Kit; User Interaction; Evasion Technique
AB Phishing kits have become increasingly popular among cybercriminals because they offer an easy-to-use and efficient way for phishing attackers to build phishing websites. Prior work on phishing kits has focused on analyzing specific behavioral features (e.g., evasion techniques), and measuring their effectiveness on the anti-phishing mechanisms. Unfortunately, such prior studies provide a limited perspective, either targeting specific phishing kits or not fully addressing the server-side strategies at the script level that offer insights into the phishing attacker's view.
   In this paper, we systematically conduct a comprehensive study of phishing kits at the script level, aiming to better understand the server-side behavior. Particularly, we design a crawler that periodically (every 15 mins) collects phishing kits used in the wild and client-side resources of real-world phishing websites (e.g., index.html, images, CSS, JavaScript) for 18 months. We utilize two types of our collected dataset (4,153 phishing kits and 2.4M phishing webpages) for our study. First, we classify user interaction patterns based on information-exfiltrating components of phishing kits into three categories: single-stage (non-real-time) phishing, multi-stage (non-real-time) phishing, and multi-stage (real-time) phishing. We then identify the potential information leakage of each pattern. Next, we conduct an in-depth script-level analysis of the evasive behaviors in the kits. Aiming to evaluate their practical impact on the phishing sites, we also measure how many phishing kits are used and deployed with an emphasis on the chronological trends for phishing attacks by clustering the landing pages of phishing kits with those of our collected phishing websites. Lastly, we discuss the security implications of our comprehensive study on web interaction, URL patterns/redirection, and kit-deployment trends in the phishing detection literature.

AB The replicability crisis in the social, behavioral, and data sciences has led to the formulation of algorithm frameworks for replicability - i.e., a requirement that an algorithm produce identical outputs (with high probability) when run on two different samples from the same underlying distribution. While still in its infancy, provably replicable algorithms have been developed for many fundamental tasks in machine learning and statistics, including statistical query learning, the heavy hitters problem, and distribution testing. In this work we initiate the study of replicable reinforcement learning, providing a provably replicable algorithm for parallel value iteration, and a provably replicable version of R-max in the episodic setting. These are the first formal replicability results for control problems, which present different challenges for replication than batch learning settings.

AB Conventional technology for the modification of surfaces loaded with nanomaterials typically requires a three-step process: (1) the construction of a polymer platform, (2) the synthesis of nanoparticles (NPs), and (3) the immobilization or anchoring of NPs. During the immobilization or anchoring process, there is an unavoidable excess of NPs primarily situated at the top of the surface, resulting in the agglomeration of aggregates. These aggregates can form different shapes and sizes, often creating an uneven distribution of NPs, resulting in an unstable coating that gradually releases NPs over time. In this study, argon plasma technology was used to create an innovative nanocoating consisting of polymer chains that are cross-linked to metal NPs, forming a polymer composite. To do this, argon plasma was employed as both an oxidizing and reducing agent during different steps in the nanocoating fabrication process. More specifically, a "grafting-from" approach, coupled with in situ argon plasma-assisted reduction of Cu2+ to Cu-0, provided an innovative means for the construction of the nanocoating. With this "grafting-from" approach, the covalent binding of acrylic acid monomers to a surface results in a negatively charged nanocoating when exposed to solutions of a pH greater than 4.5. Due to its negative charge, the nanocoating can bind cations from solution, creating a platform for the in situ argon plasma-assisted reduction of Cu2+ to primarily Cu-0 NPs (CuNPs). By controlling grafting conditions, in situ plasma-assisted reduction of NPs, and cross-linking conditions, we can generate nanocoatings with specific (1) polymer graft density and film thickness, (2) NP concentration cross-linked to polymer chains, and (3) NP composition. Under optimal experimental conditions, a nonleaching cross-linkage occurs between the nanocoating and the NPs, with only minimal NP aggregation. We have used this technology to engineer cross-linked nanocoatings possessing extremely low amounts of CuNPs (4.02 mu g/cm(2)), which are distributed within the nanocoating and are capable of preventing infections.

AB Poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) hydrogels are biocompatible and photo-cross-linkable, with accessible values of elastic modulus ranging from kPa to MPa, leading to their wide use in biomedical and soft material applications. However, PEGDA gels possess complex microstructures, limiting the use of standard polymer theories to describe them. As a result, we lack a foundational understanding of how to relate their composition, processing, and mechanical properties. To address this need, we use a data-driven approach to develop an empirical predictive framework based on high-quality data obtained from uniaxial compression tests and validated using prior data found in the literature. The developed framework accurately predicts the hydrogel shear modulus and the strain-stiffening coefficient using only synthesis parameters, such as the molecular weight and initial concentration of PEGDA, as inputs. These results provide simple and reliable experimental guidelines for precisely controlling both the low-strain and high-strain mechanical responses of PEGDA hydrogels, thereby facilitating their design for various applications.

AB Topological insulators and semimetals have been shown to possess intriguing thermoelectric properties promising for energy harvesting and cooling applications. However, thermoelectric transport associated with the Fermi arc topological surface states on topological Dirac semimetals remains less explored. This work systematically examines thermoelectric transport in a series of topological Dirac semimetal Cd3As2 thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. Surprisingly, significantly enhanced Seebeck effect and anomalous Nernst effect are found at cryogenic temperatures when the Cd3As2 layer is thin. In particular, a peak Seebeck coefficient of nearly 500 mu V K-1 and a corresponding thermoelectric power factor over 30 mW K-2 m(-1) are observed at 5 K in a 25-nm-thick sample. Combining angle-dependent quantum oscillation analysis, magnetothermoelectric measurement, transport modeling, and first-principles simulation, the contributions from bulk and surface conducting channels are isolated and the unusual thermoelectric properties are attributed to the topological surface states. The analysis showcases the rich thermoelectric transport physics in quantum-confined topological Dirac semimetal thin films and suggests new routes to achieving high thermoelectric performance at cryogenic temperatures.

AB Study region: Qingtu Oasis, Shiyang River Basin, Northwest China. Study focus: Improving the Ecological Water Diversion (EWD) process is crucial for promoting recovering terminal oases in arid inland basins. This research developed a Monthly Conceptual Lumped Ecohydrological Model (MCLEM) by integrating the surface water and groundwater balance, ecological response, and evapotranspiration equations. The MCLEM coupling with the scenario simulation effectively depicted the oasis's intra-annual ecohydrological dynamics responding to various EWD processes under wet, regular, and dry meteorological conditions, implying for designing a rational EWD strategy achieving optimal ecological benefits regarding a larger oasis area and higher vegetation coverage. New hydrological insights for the region: Given the total volume of 30 million m3, the current EWD of 10 million m3 each month during the second half of the vegetation growing season recovered the Qingtu Oasis to an average peak oasis area of 16.90 km2 and an average peak vegetation coverage of 15.90 % under various meteorological conditions. Comparatively, the EWD of 5 million m3 each month during the entire vegetation growing season could produce an average peak oasis area of 20.17 km2 and an average peak vegetation coverage of 18.59 %. Comparing the ecological benefits resulting from different EWD scenarios suggested adjusting the EWD process from transferring water during the second half of the vegetation growing season to transferring water during the entire vegetation growing season.

AB Recently, the EMPRESS Collaboration has included new data in the extraction of the primordial He-4 abundance from big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), resulting in a determination that differs from the previous value and from theoretical expectations. There have been several studies attempting to explain this anomaly which involve variation of fundamental constants between the time of BBN and the present. Since the Higgs vacuum expectation value (vev) is the only dimensionful parameter in the Standard Model and it is already known to vary during the electroweak phase transition, we consider the possibility that the vev is slightly different during BBN compared to its present value. A modification of the vev changes not only particle masses but also affects, through mass thresholds, the QCD confinement scale. We use the recently developed PRyMordial program to study this variation and its impact on the He-4 and deuterium abundances. We find that bounds on vertical bar delta v/v vertical bar are approximately 0.01, and that the EMPRESS result can be explained within 2 sigma if 0.008 < delta v/v < 0.02, but at the cost of worsening the current 2 sigma discrepancy in the deuterium abundance to over 3 sigma.

AB The spread of infectious diseases is a highly complex spatiotemporal process, difficult to understand, predict, and effectively respond to. Machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) have achieved impressive results in other learning and prediction tasks; however, while many AI solutions are developed for disease prediction, only a few of them are adopted by decision-makers to support policy interventions. Among several issues preventing their uptake, AI methods are known to amplify the bias in the data they are trained on. This is especially problematic for infectious disease models that typically leverage large, open, and inherently biased spatiotemporal data. These biases may propagate through the modeling pipeline to decision-making, resulting in inequitable policy interventions. Therefore, there is a need to gain an understanding of how the AI disease modeling pipeline can mitigate biased input data, in-processing models, and biased outputs. Specifically, our vision is to develop a large-scale micro-simulation of individuals from which human mobility, population, and disease ground-truth data can be obtained. From this complete dataset-which may not reflect the real world-we can sample and inject different types of bias. By using the sampled data in which bias is known (as it is given as the simulation parameter), we can explore how existing solutions for fairness in AI can mitigate and correct these biases and investigate novel AI fairness solutions. Achieving this vision would result in improved trust in such models for informing fair and equitable policy interventions.

AB Delithiation of the known layered LiBC compound was predicted to induce conventional superconductivity at liquid nitrogen temperatures but extensive experimental work over the past two decades has detected no signs of the expected superconducting transition. Using a combination of first-principles stability analysis and anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg formalism, we have investigated possible LixBC morphologies and established what particular transformations of the planar honeycomb BC layers are detrimental to the materials superconductivity. We propose that LixBC reintercalation with select alkali and alkaline earth metals could lead to synthesis of otherwise inaccessible metastable LixMyBC superconductors with critical temperatures (Tc) up to 73 K. The large-scale exploration of metal borocarbides has revealed that NaBC and Li1/2NayBC layered phases are likely true ground states at low temperatures. The findings indicate that this compositional space may host overlooked synthesizable compounds with potential to break the Tc record for conventional superconductivity in ambient-pressure materials.
   A large-scale ab initio search for conventional superconductors has revealed new thermodynamically stable and metastable layered metal borocarbides expected to form under ambient pressure and display critical temperatures exceeding 70 K.

AB The growing demands for high-temperature materials, especially in aerospace and energy production, compel thorough explorations of innovative materials. Here, we demonstrate significantly enhanced high-temperature mechanical properties of Inconel 625 (In625) based metal matrix composites (MMCs) fabricated by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing. The MMC feedstocks for LPBF were fabricated with fine ceramic particles (i.e., titanium diboride (TiB2), titanium carbide (TiC), zirconium diboride (ZrB2) and zirconium carbide (ZrC)) separately mixed with In625 powders. Among the printed specimens, the In625 + TiB2 showed an exceptional strength-ductility combination at 800 degrees C as well as an outstanding creep resistance at 800 degrees C under 150 MPa tensile stress. The detailed microstructural characterization, along with thermodynamic calculation and atomic simulations, reveal that the addition of TiB2 results in the formation of serrated grain boundaries, (Cr, Mo)-boride phases near the grain boundaries, and nano-dispersed (Ti, Al, Nb)-oxide phases within the matrix. These features effectively suppress the formation of detrimental high-temperature phases and enhance the material's high-temperature properties. Beyond amplifying the inherent thermal attributes of In625 superalloy, the research highlights the transformative potential of boride doping and the composition design of MMCs specifically for the LPBF process.

AB Analyzing the spatial-temporal changes in tropical cyclone (TC) tracks in the east China coastal ocean (ECCO) to quantify the magnitude of poleward and landward migration of TCs is of significant importance for coastal disaster mitigation and planning due to its susceptibility to the impacts of TCs. In this study, the TCs that affected the ECCO from 1949 to 2022 are classified into three typical types of tracks using the k-means clustering method, mass moments, and track interpolation based on TC location, shape, and intensity information. Type 1 is a northwestward track, Type 2 is a northwest to northeast-turning track, and Type 3 is a northwest to northeastturning offshore track. Type 1 tracks mainly make landfall in southern China, while Type 2 predominantly makes landfall in eastern China. Moreover, the proportion of Type 1 decreases while their landfall percentage increases over time, and the proportion of Type 2 tracks is increasing. The probability of TC effects on the eastern and northern parts of the ECCO is increasing, and the boundary where the TC center reaches after landfall is shifting landward. During the period from 1994 to 2022, there has been a significant migration in TC tracks, with the mean centroid of the TCs affecting the ECCO shifting westward by 0.66 degrees in longitude and northward by 1.26 degrees in latitude, which means the magnitude of the poleward shift is about twice that of the landward shift. This migration appears to have been pre-conditioned by a combined influence of a weakening westward steering flow, reduced vertical wind shear, and warmer sea surface temperature Our findings provide valuable insights into the longitudinal and latitudinal migration of TC tracks and have important implications for disaster prevention, mitigation planning, and the adjustment of crucial coastal protection zones in the ECCO and similar regions around the globe.

AB While the dithiolene-based N-heterocyclic silane (4) reacts with two equivalents of BX3 (X = Br, I) to give zwitterionic Lewis adducts 5 and 8, respectively, the parallel reaction of 4 with BCl3 results in 10, a dithiolene-substituted N-heterocyclic silane, via the Si-S bond cleavage. Unlike 5, the labile 8 may be readily converted to 9via BI3-mediated cleavage of the Si-N bond. The formation of 5 and 8 confirms that 4 uniquely possesses dual nucleophilic sites: (a) the terminal sulphur atom of the dithiolene moiety; and (b) the backbone carbon of the N-heterocyclic silane unit.
   Dithiolene-based N-heterocyclic silane demonstrates unusual dual nucleophilic reactivity toward boron halides.

AB unsupervised Machine Learning (ML) techniques are powerful tools in identifying similarity patterns and can be utilized to categorize the data into related groups. This study showcases the applications of unsupervised methods, namely hierarchical clustering to carefully determine related groups of newly identified genomic islands. Genomic islands (GIs) are mobile genetic elements integrated into bacterial chromosomes. GIs can impact evolution of bacteria for example by carrying virulence or metabolic genes [1]. Precisely identifying GIs calls for a sophisticated process which we have recently implemented as an already published tool called TIGER which stands for Target / Integrative Genetic Element Retriever (TIGER). TIGER identifies mobile DNAs in each genome and identifies genomic islands with high accuracy [2]. We have employed TIGER to identify approximately 130,000 GIs in E. coli bacteria. To identify the similarities among the E. coli GIs, the hierarchical clustering algorithms and our heuristics have successfully categorized the data into relevant groups. We have been able to identify related groups of GIs as well as singleton GIs. Our results provide a promising method for categorizing large DNA segments that can be compared using a similarity measure and be categorized into more precise clusters for further analysis.

AB Rising income segregation perpetuates socioeconomic inequalities, preventing us from developing more sustainable environments. In the literature, little is known about the spatiotemporal dynamics of income segregation under natural disaster. To address this gap, this paper aims to quantify how people experience income segregation in the context of a disaster through their mobility patterns. Specifically, we propose a generalized framework to construct a dynamic mobility network that describes the footprint of residents within their activity spaces, leveraging large-scale mobile phone data. The construction of this network is formulated as a nonlinear programming model and solved by the Lagrangian relaxation and numerical iterative method. A case study is presented to examine income segregation of residents in Harris County (Texas) in access to various critical facilities before, during, and after the winter storm Uri. Our results indicate that income segregation behaviors vary at different critical facilities, as facilities with smaller catchment areas are found to have higher degrees of segregation. We also highlight the disparities in access to critical facilities between low-income and high-income neighborhoods. This paper provides a new venue to better understand income segregation behavior under natural disaster through human mobility networks, which could inform equitable resource allocation in disaster management.

AB Nonaqueous fluidic transport and ion solvation propertiesundernanoscale confinement are poorly understood, especially in ion conductionfor energy storage and conversion systems. Herein, metal-organicframeworks (MOFs) and aprotic electrolytes are studied as a robustplatform for molecular-level insights into electrolyte behaviors inconfined spaces. By employing computer simulations, along with spectroscopicand electrochemical measurements, we demonstrate several phenomenathat deviate from the bulk, including modulated solvent molecularconfigurations, aggregated solvation structures, and tunable transportmechanisms from quasi-solid to quasi-liquid in functionalized MOFs.Technologically, taking advantage of confinement effects may proveuseful for addressing stability concerns associated with volatileorganic electrolytes while simultaneously endowing ultrafast transportof solvates, resulting in improved battery performance, even at extremetemperatures. The molecular-level insights presented here furtherour understanding of structure-property relationships of complexfluids at the nanoscale, information that can be exploited for thepredictive design of more efficient electrochemical systems.

AB Cnidarians display a wide diversity of life cycles. Among the main cnidarian clades, only Medusozoa possesses a swimming life cycle stage called the medusa, alternating with a benthic polyp stage. The medusa stage was repeatedly lost during medusozoan evolution, notably in the most diverse medusozoan class, Hydrozoa. Here, we show that the presence of the homeobox gene Tlx in Cnidaria is correlated with the presence of the medusa stage, the gene having been lost in clades that ancestrally lack a medusa (anthozoans, endocnidozoans) and in medusozoans that secondarily lost the medusa stage. Our characterization of Tlx expression indicate an upregulation of Tlx during medusa development in three distantly related medusozoans, and spatially restricted expression patterns in developing medusae in two distantly related species, the hydrozoan Podocoryna carnea and the scyphozoan Pelagia noctiluca. These results suggest that Tlx plays a key role in medusa development and that the loss of this gene is likely linked to the repeated loss of the medusa life cycle stage in the evolution of Hydrozoa.
   Analysis of the homeobox gene Tlx across cnidarian genomes highlights the presence of Tlx only in clades featuring the medusa life cycle stage, linking the loss of the gene to loss of the medusa in Hydrozoa evolution.

TI NIRS-BIDS: Brain Imaging Data Structure Extended to Near-Infrared
   Spectroscopy
SO SCIENTIFIC DATA
LA English
DT Article
AB Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is an increasingly popular neuroimaging technique that measures cortical hemodynamic activity in a non-invasive and portable fashion. Although the fNIRS community has been successful in disseminating open-source processing tools and a standard file format (SNIRF), reproducible research and sharing of fNIRS data amongst researchers has been hindered by a lack of standards and clarity over how study data should be organized and stored. This problem is not new in neuroimaging, and it became evident years ago with the proliferation of publicly available neuroimaging datasets. To solve this critical issue, the neuroimaging community created the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) that specifies standards for how datasets should be organized to facilitate sharing and reproducibility of science. Currently, BIDS supports dozens of neuroimaging modalities including MRI, EEG, MEG, PET, and many others. In this paper, we present the extension of BIDS for NIRS data alongside tools that may assist researchers in organizing existing and new data with the goal of promoting public disseminations of fNIRS datasets.

AB The hydrolysis rates of many organic chemicals are accelerated under alkaline conditions by the presence of hydroxide (HO-), which is typically assumed to be the predominant species contributing to base-catalyzed hydrolysis in both natural waters and laboratory buffers used in standard protocols. In this study, we demonstrated that weak bases (e.g., carbonates and phosphates) are able to catalyze the hydrolysis of the proherbicide isoxaflutole, an emerging contaminant of concern in water resources, under conditions relevant to both natural waters and laboratory protocols. Second-order rate constants for isoxaflutole hydrolysis catalyzed by individual bases were correlated with the pK a of the conjugate acid of the base using the Br & oslash;nsted relationship. Using these values, we determined that buffer effects accounted for 43-99% of previously reported rate constants for base-catalyzed isoxaflutole hydrolysis misattributed to HO-, resulting in hydrolysis rates predicted in natural waters overestimated by 5- to 30-fold from pH 7.0 to 8.5. In comparison, our corrected rate constants accurately predicted isoxaflutole hydrolysis measured in natural waters within a factor of 5. While isoxaflutole hydrolysis in surface water remains predominantly catalyzed by HO- following standard assumptions, carbonate species (particularly bicarbonate) are predicted to drive the reaction in as many as 83% of groundwater systems.

AB The para spin isomer of hydrogen gas possesses high nuclear spin order that can enhance the NMR signals of a variety of molecular species. Hydrogen is routinely enriched in the para spin state by lowering the gas temperature while flowing through a catalyst. Although parahydrogen enrichments approaching 100% are achievable near the H-2 liquefaction temperature of 20 K, many experimentalists operate at liquid nitrogen temperatures (77 K) due to the lower associated costs and overall simplicity of the parahydrogen generator. Parahydrogen that is generated at 77 K provides an enrichment value of similar to 51% of the para spin isomer; while useful, there are many applications that can benefit from low-cost access to higher parahydrogen enrichments. Here, we introduce a method of improving parahydrogen enrichment values using a liquid nitrogen-cooled generator that operates at temperatures less than 77 K. The boiling temperature of liquid nitrogen is lowered through internal evaporation into helium gas bubbles that are injected into the liquid. Changes to liquid nitrogen temperatures and parahydrogen enrichment values were monitored as a function of helium gas flow rate. The injected helium bubbles lowered the liquid nitrogen temperature to similar to 65.5 K, and parahydrogen enrichments of up to similar to 59% were achieved; this represents an similar to 16% improvement compared with the expected parahydrogen fraction at 77 K. This technique is simple to implement in standard liquid nitrogen-cooled parahydrogen generators and may be of interest to a wide range of scientists that require a cost-effective approach to improving parahydrogen enrichment values.

AB Eddies play a crucial role in shaping ocean dynamics by affecting material transport, and generating spatio-temporal heterogeneity. However, how eddies at different scales modulate biogeochemical transformation rates remains an open question. Applying a multi-scale decomposition to a numerical simulation, we investigate the respective impact of mesoscale and submesoscale eddies on nutrient transport and biogeochemical cycling in the California Current System. First, the non-linear nature of nutrient uptake by phytoplankton results in a 50% reduction in primary production in the presence of eddies. Second, eddies shape the vertical transport of nutrients with a strong compensation between mesoscale and submesoscale. Third, the eddy effect on nutrient uptake is controlled by the covariance of temperature, nutrient and phytoplankton fluctuations caused by eddies. Our results shed new light on the tight interaction between non-linear fluid dynamics and ecosystem processes in realistic eddy regimes, which remain largely under-resolved by global Earth system models.

AB The current state of practice for designing dense granular columns (DGCs) relies heavily on simplified procedures that assume free-field conditions (no structure or slope) and uniformly layered, level soil deposits composed of clean sand. These guidelines ignore stratigraphic variabilities in the permeability, groundwater table, layer thickness, or relative density of soil layers commonly found in natural deposits. Prior research has shown that such variability can significantly influence the contribution of different mechanisms of displacement, excess pore water pressure generation and redistribution, formation of soil ejecta at the ground surface, accelerations, and subsequent damage to the foundation and structure. These effects and the implications on system performance are poorly understood and, hence, not considered in the design of mitigation strategies. In this paper, fully coupled, three-dimensional (3D), nonlinear dynamic finite-element analyses in OpenSees, validated with centrifuge models, are performed to evaluate fundamentally how DGCs influence the seismic performance of sites with realistic stratigraphy and their overlying shallow-founded structures. The effectiveness of drainage and reinforcement provided by DGCs is shown to depend strongly on the heterogeneity of the soil profile. Draining DGCs are shown to have the potential to effectively reduce the permanent settlement of the foundation compared to an unmitigated structure. In addition, drains with an area replacement ratio (Ar) greater than 20% significantly reduced the severity of ejecta (quantified through hydraulic gradients) and excess pore pressure ratios in the liquefiable layers. This reduction was especially effective in the case when DGCs were accompanied by densification. However, treatment could adversely impact the acceleration demand transferred to the superstructure due to reduced damping and increased soil stiffness. The results highlight the critical importance of considering stratigraphic variations in the design of mitigation strategies that holistically improve the performance of the soil-foundation-structure system.

AB Interfacing perovskites with two-dimensional materials such as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) for improved stability and electron or hole extraction has emerged as a promising path forward for the generation of highly efficient and stable solar cells. In this work, we examine the structural properties and excitation dynamics of two MOF-perovskite systems: UMCM309-a@MAPbI(3 )and ZrL3@MAPbI(3). We find that precise band alignment and electronegativity of the MOF-linkers are necessary to facilitate the capture of excited charge carriers. Furthermore, we demonstrate that intraband relaxation of hot electrons to the MOF subsystem results in optically disallowed transitions across the band gap, suppressing radiative recombination. Furthermore, we elucidate the key mechanisms associated with improved structural stability afforded to the perovskites by the two-dimensional MOFs, highlighting the necessity of broad surface coverage and strong MOF-perovskite interaction.

AB We use complex network theory to study a class of photonic continuous variable quantum states that present both multipartite entanglement and non-Gaussian statistics. We consider the intermediate scale of several dozens of modes at which such systems are already hard to characterize. In particular, the states are built from an initial imprinted cluster state created via Gaussian entangling operations according to a complex network structure. We then engender non-Gaussian statistics via multiple photon subtraction operations acting on a single node. We replicate in the quantum regime some of the models that mimic real-world complex networks in order to test their structural properties under local operations. We go beyond the already known single-mode effects, by studying the emergent network of photon-number correlations via complex networks measures. We analytically prove that the imprinted network structure defines a vicinity of nodes, at a distance of four steps from the photon-subtracted node, in which the emergent network changes due to photon subtraction. We show numerically that the emergent structure is greatly influenced by the structure of the imprinted network. Indeed, while the mean and the variance of the degree and clustering distribution of the emergent network always increase, the higher moments of the distributions are governed by the specific structure of the imprinted network. Finally, we show that the behaviour of nearest neighbours of the subtraction node depends on how they are connected to each other in the imprinted structure.

AB In this work we present PRyMordial: A package dedicated to efficient computations of observables in the Early Universe with the focus on the cosmological era of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). The code offers fast and precise evaluation of BBN light-element abundances together with the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, including non-instantaneous decoupling effects. PRyMordial is suitable for state-of-the-art analyses in the Standard Model as well as for general investigations into New Physics active during BBN. After reviewing the physics implemented in PRyMordial, we provide a short guide on how to use the code for applications in the Standard Model and beyond. The package is written in Python, but more advanced users can optionally take advantage of the open-source community for Julia. PRyMordial is publicly available on GitHub.

AB Difficulties in controlling IRSs to form the optimized passive beamforming have rarely been considered in intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided systems, which are summarized as follows: 1) sending the optimized passive precoding vectors to the IRS controller incurs significant control overheads; 2) implementing the optimized passive precoding needs to set massive modes in the IRS control circuit. To address these issues, we investigate codebook-based passive beamforming for multi-IRS-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) systems, where the control overheads are reduced to several scalars and the number of modes set in the IRS control circuit is reduced to that of codewords. Moreover, we formulate a joint passive and active precoding problem in the multi-IRS-aided mmWave MU-MISO system as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, and then develop a generalized Benders decomposition (GBD)-based joint passive and active precoding algorithm. The proposed algorithm offers near-optimal performance (>= 99.9%) with significantly-reduced computational complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves energy savings of up to 50% and 95%, compared to the benchmark by the maximum ratio transmission and that without IRSs, respectively. In addition, the energy savings increase with the number of reflecting elements packed on each IRS as well as that of codewords.

AB The growth of the Machine-Learning-As-A-Service (MLaaS) market has highlighted clients' data privacy and security issues. Private inference (PI) techniques using cryptographic primitives offer a solution but often have high computation and communication costs, particularly with non-linear operators like ReLU. Many attempts to reduce ReLU operations exist, but they may need heuristic threshold selection or cause substantial accuracy loss. This work introduces AutoReP, a gradient-based approach to lessen non-linear operators and alleviate these issues. It automates the selection of ReLU and polynomial functions to speed up PI applications and introduces distribution-aware polynomial approximation (DaPa) to maintain model expressivity while accurately approximating ReLUs. Our experimental results demonstrate significant accuracy improvements of 6.12% (94.31%, 12.9K ReLU budget, CIFAR-10), 8.39% (74.92%, 12.9K ReLU budget, CIFAR-100), and 9.45% (63.69%, 55K ReLU budget, Tiny-ImageNet) over current state-of-the-art methods, e.g., SNL. Morever, AutoReP is applied to EfficientNet-B2 on ImageNet dataset, and achieved 75.55% accuracy with 176.1 x ReLU budget reduction. The codes are shared on Github(1).

AB Knowledge graph has become a cutting-edge technology for linking and integrating heterogeneous, cross-domain datasets to address critical scientific questions. As big data has become prevalent in today's scientific analysis, semantic data repositories that can store and manage large knowledge graph data have become critical in suc-cessfully deploying spatially explicit knowledge graph applications. This paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of the popular semantic data repositories and their computational performance in managing and providing semantic support for spatial queries. There are three types of semantic data repositories: (1) triple store solutions (RDF4j, Fuseki, GraphDB, Virtuoso), (2) property graph databases (Neo4j), and (3) an Ontology-Based Data Access (OBDA) approach (Ontop). Experiments were conducted to compare each repository's efficiency (e. g., query response time) in handling geometric, topological, and spatial-semantic related queries. The results show that Virtuoso achieves the overall best performance in both non-spatial and spatial-semantic queries. The OBDA solution, Ontop, has the second-best query performance in spatial and complex queries and the best storage efficiency, requiring the least data-to-RDF conversion efforts. Other triple store solutions suffer from various issues that cause performance bottlenecks in handling spatial queries, such as inefficient memory management and lack of proper query optimization.

AB A chlorine-substituted Criegee intermediate, ClCHOO, is photolytically generated using a diiodo precursor, detected by VUV photoionization at 118 nm, and spectroscopically characterized via ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis)-induced depletion of m/z = 80 under jet cooled conditions. UV-vis excitation resonant with a pi* <- pi transition yields a significant ground state depletion, indicating a strong electronic transition and rapid photodissociation. The broad absorption spectrum peaks at 350 nm and is attributed to contributions from both syn (similar to 70%) and anti (similar to 30%) conformers of ClCHOO based on spectral simulations using a nuclear ensemble method. Electronic structure theory shows significant differences in the vertical excitation energies of the two conformers (330 and 371 nm, respectively) as well as their relative stabilities in the ground and excited electronic states associated with the pi* <- pi transition. Natural bond orbital analysis reveals significant and nonintuitive nonbonding contributions to the relative stabilities of the syn and anti conformers.

AB A longstanding debate asks why African Americans have been disproportionately concentrated in poor neighborhoods. All sides agree that a key contributor is the high level of poverty among Blacks, but they differ on other sources. Has the exodus of a growing Black middle class from the inner city (raising income segregation among Blacks) left the Black poor more isolated? Does persistent high racial segregation hold both middle class and poor Blacks in neighborhoods that are depressed by the high rate of Black poverty? Is poverty in Black neighborhoods mainly due to the presence of poor Black households or poor non-Black neighbors? This study addresses these questions with data for 1980-2020, and extends the analysis also to the case of Hispanic poverty exposure. Longitudinal models and detailed analysis of neighborhood composition by race and income show that the group's own income composition is the most important predictor of poverty exposure. This effect is compounded by high racial segregation. Within-group income segregation adds to poverty concentration for Blacks but not for Hispanics. Blacks and Hispanics of all income levels live in poorer neighborhoods mainly because of the large share of their Black and Hispanic low-income neighbors, while their white neighbors tend to have higher incomes than they do.

TI Traveling waves at the surface of active liquid crystals
SO SOFT MATTER
LA English
DT Article
AB Active liquid crystals exert nonequilibrium stresses on their surroundings through constant consumption of energy, giving rise to dynamical steady states not present in equilibrium. The paradigmatic example of an active liquid crystal is a suspension of microtubule bundles powered by kinesin motor proteins, which exhibits self-sustained spatiotemporal chaotic flows. This system has been modelled using continuum theories that couple the microtubule orientation to active flows. Recently the focus has shifted to the interfacial properties of mixtures of active liquid crystals and passive fluids. Active/passive interfaces have been shown to support propagating capillary waves in the absence of inertia and offer a promising route for relating experimental parameters to those of the continuum theory. In this paper we report the derivation of a minimal model that captures the linear dynamics of the interface between an active liquid crystal and a passive fluid. We show that the dynamics of the interface, although powered by active flows throughout the bulk, is qualitatively captured by equations that couple non-reciprocally interface height and nematic director at the interface. This minimal model reproduces the dynamical structure factor evaluated from numerical simulations and the qualitative form of the wave dispersion relation seen in experiments.
   The interface of an active liquid crystal can support travelling waves. We derive dispersion relations from a linear theory and compute the dynamical structure factor from continuum simulations.

AB Melanin is a group of heterogeneous polymeric pigments that has been proposed to perform various biological functions and is attracting increasing technological interest as a sustainable electronic material for energy storage and bioelectronics. Here, we prepared a semitransparent hydrogel film from a soluble melanin obtained from the black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens; BSF) and applied an operando spectroelectrochemical approach to investigate the molecular-level changes that occur when electrons are "flowing" through this melanin (i.e., while electron transfer processes are "in operation"). Like other natural and synthetic melanins, we observed that the BSF melanin has reversible redox activities in the mid-physiological redox potential range. We report that electron transfer can occur through an indirect (mediator-based) mechanism and also through a direct mechanism involving an extrinsic electron exchange with conducting graphene. In both mechanisms, we show that electron transfer is correlated to a reversible switching of the melanin's redox state. Finally, we provide evidence to support a chemical disorder model, which suggests that the properties of melanin may involve diverse structural and mechanistic features that occur over various length scales. Overall, we show that operando spectroelectrochemical measurements can bridge traditional bottom-up and top-down methods to facilitate the characterization of melanin.

AB The relationships between digital technologies and the realization of teaching and learning activities have received increased attention in interdisciplinary research. Knowledge of the connections between technological designs and users' meaning making in semiotic chains is, however, still partial. Teachers' and students' reme-diation of technological designs through cognitive processing was studied in this paper to gain insights into semiotic chain configurations. Data consisting of video recordings, interviews, and observations were processed with quantitative content analysis and learning analytics strategies. The findings suggest that the technological design's visualized functions greatly affect the semiotic chain configuration when integrated with their users' meaning making in lower-level actions. Technological designs seem to buttonize meaning making, and teaching and learning activities become technologized. Scaled cognitive processes can provide insights into differentiated meaning making according to the technologies, and perspectives on paralanguage are proposed.

AB Ultrasound-directed self-assembly (DSA) utilizes the acoustic radiation force associated with a standing ultrasound wave field to organize particles dispersed in a fluid medium into specific patterns. State-of-the-art ultrasound DSA methods use single-frequency ultrasound wave fields, which only allow organizing particles into simple, periodic patterns, or require a large number of ultrasound transducers to assemble complex patterns. In contrast, this work introduces multi-frequency ultrasound wave fields to organize particles into complex patterns. A method is theoretically derived to determine the operating parameters (frequency, amplitude, phase) of any arrangement of ultrasound transducers, required to assemble spherical particles dispersed in a fluid medium into specific patterns, and experimentally validated for a system with two frequencies. The results show that multi-frequency compared to single-frequency ultrasound DSA enables the assembly of complex patterns of particles with substantially fewer ultrasound transducers. Additionally, the method does not incur a penalty in terms of accuracy, and it does not require custom hardware for each different pattern, thus offering reconfigurability, which contrasts, e.g., acoustic holography. Multi-frequency ultrasound DSA can spur progress in a myriad of engineering applications, including the manufacturing of multi-functional polymer matrix composite materials that derive their structural, electric, acoustic, or thermal properties from the spatial organization of particles in the matrix.

However, subject teaching is characterized by typical settings and activities that might require different classroom management strategies. This small-scale explorative study investigates whether twenty expert teachers from two secondary school subjects (biology and mathematics) differ in their professional vision of classroom management. Using video clips of two settings as stimuli, teachers' eye-tracking data and retrospective think-aloud data were recorded. Think-aloud data were investigated with quantitative content analysis and epistemic network analysis. Expert teachers' visual attention, their noticing of classroom management events, and their knowledge-based reasoning were compared for both groups. Results reveal subject-specific aspects of expert teachers' professional vision of classroom management in terms of events noticed and their reasoning about these events. Expert biology teachers were more concerned with suggesting alternative classroom management strategies, particularly strategies addressing aspects to consider when planning activities such as providing structure or preparing the classroom. In contrast, mathematics teachers were more evaluative in their analysis of events and focused more on behavioral management or ensuring students' engagement in the moment.

AB The toxicity of paraquat is believed to involve a redox-cycling mechanism that can disrupt cellular redox homeostasis and, also, generate damaging free radicals. It has been suggested that for cases of severe paraquat poisoning the administration of ascorbate (i.e., vitamin C) can confer benefit by quenching the paraquat free radical (PQ + <middle dot> ). Here, we used an electrochemical approach that abstracts-away many of the (bio)chemical complexities and isolates the redox-interactions between paraquat and ascorbate. Specifically, we used a series of experiments that coupled electrochemical measurements of electron flow with optical measurements of paraquat's redox-state switching. Our results demonstrate that the reduced absorbate cannot quench the PQ + <middle dot>-radical because they are both reductants. However, oxidation of ascorbate does allow PQ + <middle dot>-radical scavenging. More broadly, we believe this study demonstrates the potential for developing electrochemical approaches to complement existing experimental methods in redox biology.

AB With growing environmental concerns, the removal of toxic industrial dyes from wastewater has become a critical global issue. In this study, TiO2-CuSe composites were synthesized using a cost-effective and simple chemical method to determine the optimal concentration of CuSe for the efficient degradation of methylene blue (MB) under visible light. The TiO2 samples exhibited a mix of rutile and anatase phases, while CuSe formed in a hexagonal phase. Both TiO2 and CuSe were observed to have agglomerated particles with indistinct boundaries. The optical bandgap shifted towards the visible region from 3.25 eV (pure TiO2) to 2.91 eV with increasing the amount of CuSe in the composites. The photocatalytic activity of TiO2, CuSe, and TiO2-CuSe composites was evaluated by monitoring MB degradation, with the composites outperforming the individual components under visible light. Notably, the TiO2-20% CuSe composite (AK-4) demonstrated superior efficiency, removing 98% of MB in just 70 minutes. The photocatalysts also exhibited enhanced antibacterial properties, effectively reducing E. coli colonies from 1.71 x 10(12) CFU mL(-1) (pure TiO2) to 1 x 10(10) CFU mL(-1) for the AK-4 composite. This study suggests that visible light-activated TiO2-CuSe composites could be effective for both water purification and bacterial infection control.

AB Due to the shortage of spectrum resources in the Internet of vehicles, the diversified time-sensitive services for beyond fifth generation/sixth generation connected automated vehicles cannot be effectively transmitted and the existing research lacks efficient and intelligent resource scheduling methods. Therefore, this article proposes a spectrum resource scheduling model for time-sensitive services and designs a two-tier joint resource scheduling method based on the Age of Information and bandwidth requirements under macro base station (MBS) and roadside unit (RSU). In the first layer, we propose a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG)-enabled auction model to solve the time-sensitive services resource scheduling problem, in order to guarantee the authenticity of vehicle users (VUEs) bidding. In addition, the Lagrange relaxation algorithm is utilized to obtain the optimal solution of spectrum resource allocation to ensure the VUEs service delay and achieve low complexity resource scheduling. In the second layer, we design a federated learning-based MBS auxiliary communication method to alleviate RSU communication pressure. The communication links of differentiated time-sensitive services are predicted to improve the quality of perception services. Simulation results verify that the proposed algorithms can enhance the VUEs experience effectively compared with the conventional methods, in terms of the delay, throughput, and packet loss ratio.

DE Amazon Alexa; IoT; Hijacking Attack
AB Voice Personal Assistants (VPA) are becoming popular entry points to control connected devices in an IoT environment, e.g., by invoking Amazon Alexa voice-apps (called skills) to turn on/off lights through voice commands. Amazon Alexa platform allows thirdparty developers to build skills and publish them to marketplaces, which greatly extends the functionalities of VPA. Despite the many convenient features, there are increasing security and safety concerns about VPA-controlled IoT systems. Previous research demonstrated the prevalence of potentially malicious or problematic skills in the marketplace. However, existing works mainly focus on non-IoT skills (e.g., skills under the Kids and Health categories). The security and safety risks of IoT skills are largely under-explored.
   In this work, we discover new vulnerabilities in the Amazon Alexa platform, which allows malicious third-party developers to hijack Alexa's built-in voice commands to invoke malicious IoT skills. We present three new attacks hijacking Alexa's built-in IoT commands, including Command Invocation Confounding Attack, Custom Command Attack, and Command-Intent Hijacking Attack. We also find a vulnerability that allows arbitrary control of smarthome devices in the back-end code. We evaluate the success rate for each attack and prove that they can be used by malicious developers. In particular, we demonstrate that skills in the Connected Car category using Alexa's built-in intents can be hijacked by customized IoT skills. We also design and implement IoTSkillAnalyzer, a dynamic testing tool to examine IoT skills on the Alexa skills store. After analyzing 488 Alexa 3rd-party IoT skills using IoTSkillAnalyzer, we identified 52 skills with potential command hijacking attacks. We also found that 26 suspicious skills have hidden behaviors potentially caused by the Skill Back-end Code Manipulation vulnerability after they receive normal commands, such as failing to control devices, taking hidden actions, and providing wrong response information to users.

AB To satisfy the expected plethora of computation-heavy applications, federated edge learning (FEEL) is a new paradigm featuring distributed learning to carry the capacities of low-latency and privacy-preserving. To further improve the efficiency of wireless data aggregation and model learning, over-the-air computation (AirComp) is emerging as a promising solution by using the superposition characteristics of wireless channels. However, the fading and noise of wireless channels can cause aggregate distortions in AirComp enabled federated learning. In addition, the quality of collected data and energy consumption of edge devices may also impact the accuracy and efficiency of model aggregation as well as convergence. To solve these problems, this work proposes a dynamic device scheduling mechanism, which can select qualified edge devices to transmit their local models with a proper power control policy so as to participate the model training at the server in federated learning via AirComp. In this mechanism, the data importance is measured by the gradient of local model parameter, channel condition and energy consumption of the device jointly. In particular, to fully use distributed datasets and accelerate the convergence rate of federated learning, the local updates of unselected devices are also retained and accumulated for future potential transmission, instead of being discarded directly. Furthermore, the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty optimization problem is formulated for searching the optimal device selection strategy. Simulation results validate that the proposed scheduling mechanism can achieve higher test accuracy and faster convergence rate, and is robust against different channel conditions.

AB Inferring others' mental states, or mentalizing, is a critical social cognitive ability that underlies humans' remark-able capacity for complex social interactions. Recent work suggests that interracial contact shapes the recruitment of brain regions involved in mentalizing during impression formation. However, it remains unclear how a target's perceived racial group and a perceiver's previous contact with that racial group shapes mental state inferences. In this study, we examined brain activity in regions of interest associated with mentalizing and race perception among self-identified White perceivers who varied in lifetime contact while they inferred secondary emotions from perceived White eyes and perceived Black eyes (i.e., the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test). The interaction between lifetime contact and perceived target race predicted activity in the superior temporal sulcus (STS), a region consistently implicated in mental state inferences from perceptual cues, tracking eye gaze, and biological motion. Low and average contact White perceivers showed more left STS activity when inferring mental states from perceived White eyes than perceived Black eyes, whereas high contact White perceivers showed similar left STS activity regardless of perceived target race. These results indicate that interracial contact decreases racial biases in the recruitment of regions involved in mentalizing when inferring mental states from perceptual cues.

ID RESYNCHRONIZATION THERAPY; HEART; ASSOCIATION; STRAIN; DENSE
AB Identifying regions of late mechanical activation (LMA) of the left ventricular (LV) myocardium is critical in determining the optimal pacing site for cardiac resynchronization therapy in patients with heart failure. Several deep learning-based approaches have been developed to predict 3D LMA maps of LV myocardium from a stack of sparse 2D cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs). However, these models often loosely consider the geometric shape structure of the myocardium. This makes the reconstructed activation maps suboptimal; hence leading to a reduced accuracy of predicting the late activating regions of hearts. In this paper, we propose to use shape-constrained diffusion models to better reconstruct a 3D LMA map, given a limited number of 2D cardiac MRI slices. In contrast to previous methods that primarily rely on spatial correlations of image intensities for 3D reconstruction, our model leverages object shape as priors learned from the training data to guide the reconstruction process. To achieve this, we develop a joint learning network that simultaneously learns a mean shape under deformation models. Each reconstructed image is then considered as a deformed variant of the mean shape.
   To validate the performance of our model, we train and test the proposed framework on a publicly available mesh dataset of 3D myocardium and compare it with state-of-the-art deep learning-based reconstruction models. Experimental results show that our model achieves superior performance in reconstructing the 3D LMA maps as compared to the state-of-the-art models.

AB Developing automatic algorithms for real-time monitoring of underwater acoustic events is essential in ocean acoustic applications. Most previous ocean acoustic ecosystem monitoring studies are non-real-time, focusing on data received on a single hydrophone or a specific analysis, such as bearing estimation or detection, without considering the full end-to-end analysis system. Here, we develop a unified framework for real-time ocean acoustic data analysis including beamforming, detection, bearing estimation, and classification of transient underwater acoustic events. To detect sound sources, thresholding on computed mel-scale per-channel energy normalization (PCEN) is applied, followed by morphological image opening to extract pixels with significant intensities. Next, connected component analysis is applied for grouping pixel detections. The bearing of signal detections is next estimated via nonmaximum suppression (NMS) of 3-D stacked beamformed spectrogram imageries. To classify a variety of whale species from their calls, time-frequency features are extracted from each detected signal's beamformed power spectrogram. These features are next applied to train three classifiers, including support vector machine (SVM), neural networks, and random forest (RF), to classify six whale vocalization categories: Fin, Sei, Unidentified Baleen, Minke, Humpback, and general Odontocetes. Best results are obtained with the RF classifier, which achieved 96.7% accuracy and 87.5% F1 score. A variety of accelerating approaches and fast algorithms are implemented to run on GPU. During an experiment in the U.S. Northeast coast in September 2021, the software and hardware advances developed here were used for near real-time analysis of underwater acoustic data received by Northeastern University's in-house fabricated 160-element coherent hydrophone array system.

TI Stability-superconductivity map for compressed Na-intercalated graphite
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
LA English
DT Article
ID TRANSITION-TEMPERATURE; CRYSTAL
AB A recent ab initio investigation of Na-C binary compounds under moderate pressures has uncovered a possible stable NaC4 superconductor with an estimated critical temperature up to 41 K. We revisit this promising binary system by performing a more focused exploration of Na-intercalated graphite configurations, assessing the sensitivity of their thermodynamic stability to density functional approximations at different (T, P ) conditions, and examining their superconducting properties with the Migdal-Eliashberg formalism. The combinatorial screening of possible Na arrangements reveals additional stable stoichiometries, i.e., Na3C10, NaC8, NaC10, and NaC12, that redefine the previously proposed convex hulls for pressures up to 10 GPa. The evaluation of formation enthalpies with different van der Waals functionals indicates that the proposed compounds might not be thermodynamically stable at zero temperature but some of them could stabilize due to the vibrational entropy or form via cold compression if graphite is used as a starting material. Our more rigorous modeling of the electron-phonon coupling in NaC4 confirms the material's potential for high-temperature superconductivity, with a critical temperature reaching 48 K at 10 GPa, and reveals a well-defined two-gap structure unusual for an electron-doped compound. By tracking the position of the intercalant nearly free electron states with respect to the Fermi level in viable Na-C compounds, we map out the range of pressures and compositions needed for strong electron-phonon coupling and identify Na3C10 as an equally promising superconductor.

AB This article derives theoretical foundations of force field functional theory (FFFT). FFFT studies topics related to the functional representation of nonreactive forcefields to achieve various desirable properties such as: (a) formal exactness of the forcefield's energy functional under certain conditions, (b) a formally exact ansatz separating the bonded potential energy from the nonbonded potential energy within a bonded cluster in a way that enables bonded parameters to be optimized using linear regression instead of requiring nonlinear regression, (c) the potential energy's continuous differentiability to various orders with respect to energetically accessible internal coordinate displacements within a subdomain defined by one electronic ground state, (d) forcefield design that guarantees the reference ground-state geometry is exactly reproduced as an equilibrium structure on the forcefield's potential energy landscape, (e) reasonably accurate and broadly applicable frugal model potentials, (f) computationally efficient embedded feature selection that identifies and removes unimportant forcefield terms, (g) well-designed methods to parameterize the forcefield from quantum-mechanically-computed and (optionally) experimental reference data, and (h) forcefields that approximately reproduce experimentally-measured properties. This article also introduces: (1) an angle-bending model potential that more accurately describes physical dynamics and is continuously differentiable to all orders with respect to internal coordinate displacements even when the bond angle is linear (i.e., theta = pi (180 degrees)) and (2) a first-principles-derived stretch potential that accurately describes short-range Pauli repulsion and the long-range bond dissociation energy. This new angle-bending potential gave good agreement to CCSD quantum-chemistry calculations for CaH2, CO2, H2O, HNO, Li2O, NO2, NS2, SF2, SiH2, and SO2 molecules. This new bond-stretch potential reproduced the first 12+ and 30+ vibrational energy levels of H2 and O2 molecules, respectively, within a few percent of experimental values. Studying the C-F bond stretch in C6F6 as an example, the new ansatz (item (b) above) reduced sensitivity of the optimized force constant's value to choice of nonbonded interaction parameters by an order of magnitude compared to the old ansatz. Normal mode analysis of optimized flexibility models for CO2, H2O, HNO, and SO2 molecules yielded vibrational transition frequencies within a few percent of experimental values. These results demonstrate advantages of this new approach.
   This article derives and tests: (1) a formally exact forcefield functional theory to construct non-reactive forcefields using linear regression for bonded parameters and (2) better bond-stretch and angle-bending model potentials.

AB Recent coarse-grained (CG) models have often supplemented conventional pair potentials with potentials that depend upon the local density around each particle. In this work, we investigate the temperature-dependence of these local density (LD) potentials. Specifically, we employ the multiscale coarse-graining (MS-CG) force-matching variational principle to parameterize pair and LD potentials for one-site CG models of molecular liquids at ambient pressure. The accuracy of these MS-CG LD potentials quite sensitively depends upon the length-scale, r(c), that is employed to define the local density. When the local density is defined by the optimal length-scale, rc*, the MS-CG potential often accurately describes the reference state point and can provide reasonable transferability across a rather wide range of temperatures. At ambient pressure, the optimal LD length-scale varies linearly with temperature over a very wide range of temperatures. Moreover, if one adopts this temperature-dependent LD length-scale, then the MS-CG LD potential appears independent of temperature, while the MS-CG pair potential varies linearly across this temperature range. This provides a simple means for predicting pair and LD potentials that accurately model new state points without performing additional atomistic simulations. Surprisingly, at certain state points, the predicted potentials provide greater accuracy than MS-CG potentials that were optimized for the state point.

AB With limited time in the school day to meet required state-level objectives across subjects, it is challenging to meet the need to address declining physical activity levels and to incorporate additional computer science instruction in elementary schools. Project moveSMART uses a web-based platform to integrate opportunities for physical education with computer science and computational thinking (CS/CT) learning activities. Fourth grade students who underwent a single-day intervention experienced a significant improvement in their interest in coding and their perceptions of coders. This paper presents a series of three new lessons in the fifth grade moveS MART curriculum that allow students to create and improve a physical activity monitor. We employ a project-based learning approach to expose students to data analysis and machine learning in the framework of classification and pattern recognition.

AB MXenes, i.e., two-dimensional transition metal carbides and nitrides, have been reported as promising materials for various applications, including energy storage, biomedicine, and electronics. The family of MXenes has proliferated, and the chemical space of synthesized MXenes has expanded to 13 transition metals and a dozen elements in surface terminations. The diverse chemistry of MXenes enables systematical tuning of MXene properties to meet the needs of target applications. However, synthesizing new MXene compositions largely relies on a trial-and-error approach. To overcome it, computational predictions of MXene compositions that are thermodynamically stable are crucial to rationalize experimental efforts. Here, we report a comprehensive computational screening for thermodynamically stable MXenes across 29 transition metals and 11 surface terminations. Density functional theory calculations are employed to compute the energy above the convex energy hull as a descriptor of thermodynamic stability. The results are analyzed to explore factors crucial for determining the thermodynamic stability of MXenes, by which the chemistry of surface terminations is found to play a crucial role. The insights on the chemistry of 998 MXene compositions predicted to be (meta)stable are given to systematically guide further research on MXene synthesis and application.

AB The introduction of super-resolution microscopy (SRM) has significantly advanced our understanding of cellular and molecular dynamics, offering a detailed view previously beyond our reach. Implementing SRM in biophysical research, however, presents numerous challenges. This review addresses the crucial aspects of utilizing SRM effectively, from selecting appropriate fluorophores and preparing samples to analyzing complex data sets. We explore recent technological advancements and methodological improvements that enhance the capabilities of SRM. Emphasizing the integration of SRM with other analytical methods, we aim to overcome inherent limitations and expand the scope of biological insights achievable. By providing a comprehensive guide for choosing the most suitable SRM methods based on specific research objectives, we aim to empower researchers to explore complex biological processes with enhanced precision and clarity, thereby advancing the frontiers of biophysical research.

AB Lithium has been considered a potential acaricidal agent against the honey bee (Apis mellifera) parasite Varroa. It is known that lithium suppresses elevated activity and regulates circadian rhythms and light response when administered to humans as a primary therapeutic chemical for bipolar disorder and to other bipolar syndrome model organisms, given the crucial role of timing in the bee's foraging activity and the alternating sunlight vs dark colony environment bees are exposed, we explored the influence of lithium on locomotor activity (LMA) and circadian rhythm of honey bees. We conducted acute and chronic lithium administration experiments, altering light conditions and lithium doses to assess LMA and circadian rhythm changes. We fed bees one time 10 mu l sucrose solution with 0, 50, 150, and 450 mM LiCl in the acute application experiment and 0, 1, 5, and 10 mmol/kg LiCl ad libitum in bee candy in the chronic application experiment. Both acute and chronic lithium treatments significantly decreased the induced LMA under constant light. Chronic lithium treatment disrupted circadian rhythmicity in constant darkness. The circadian period was lengthened by lithium treatment under constant light. We discuss the results in the context of Varroa control and lithium's effect on bipolar disorder.

AB Refractory multi-principal element alloys (RMPEAs) promise to significantly enhance gas turbine engine efficiency, but their poor oxidation performance inhibits their implementation. Alumina-forming bond coat alloys can provide oxidation protection, but discovering suitable chemistries remains a challenge. We employed a design methodology that screens for alumina-formation capability using Al activity and phase constitution predictions from CalPhaD (Thermo-Calc). Alloy down-selection from approximately 7,800 alloys in the Nb-Si-TiAl-Hf system was conducted via analysis of calculated thermodynamic properties with number-density topology style maps. This approach is validated by creating and testing the composition Nb12Si23Ti24Al36Hf5, which forms protective alumina scales up to 1400 C-degrees and resists pesting at 800 C-degrees. Further, the alloy has an average coefficient of thermal expansion of similar to 10.1 ppm/K, making it well matched to Nb-based refractory alloys. The methodology will be useful for the design of coatings for RMPEAs, enabling their implementation and significant efficiency benefits sooner.

AB In recent decades, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have gained recognition for their potential in multicomponent gas separations. Though molecular simulations have revealed structure-property relationships of MOF-adsorbate systems, they can be computationally expensive and there is a need for surrogate models that can predict the adsorption data faster. In this work, an active learning (AL) protocol is introduced that can predict multicomponent gas adsorption in a MOF for a range of thermodynamic conditions. This methodology is applied to build a model for the adsorption of three different gas mixtures (CO2-CH4, Xe-Kr, and H2S-CO2) in the MOF Cu-BTC. A Gaussian process regression (GPR) model is used to fit the data as well to leverage its predicted uncertainty to drive the learning. The training data is generated using grand-canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations as points are iteratively added to the model to minimize the predicted uncertainty. Also, a criteria which captures the perceived performance of the GPs is introduced to terminate the AL process when the perceived accuracy threshold is met. The three systems are tested for a pressure-mole fraction (P-X), and a pressure-mole fraction-temperature (P-X-T) feature space. It is demonstrated that AL one only needs a fraction of the data from simulations to build a reliable surrogate model for predicting mixture adsorption. Further, the final GP fit from AL outperforms ideal adsorbed solution theory predictions.
   We present the development of an active learning framework to model multicomponent gas adsorption in metal-organic frameworks.

AB BackgroundPonerine ants are almost exclusively predatory and comprise many of the largest known ant species. Within this clade, the genus Neoponera is among the most conspicuous Neotropical predators. We describe the first fossil member of this lineage: a worker preserved in Miocene-age Dominican amber from Hispaniola.ResultsNeoponera vejestoria sp. nov. demonstrates a clear case of local extinction-there are no known extant Neoponera species in the Greater Antilles. The species is attributable to an extant and well-defined species group in the genus, which suggests the group is older than previously estimated. Through CT scan reconstruction and linear morphometrics, we reconstruct the morphospace of extant and fossil ants to evaluate the history and evolution of predatory taxa in this island system.ConclusionsThe fossil attests to a shift in insular ecological community structure since the Miocene. The largest predatory taxa have undergone extinction on the island, but their extant relatives persist throughout the Neotropics. Neoponera vejestoria sp. nov. is larger than all other predatory ant workers known from Hispaniola, extant or extinct. Our results empirically demonstrate the loss of a functional niche associated with body size, which is a trait long hypothesized to be related to extinction risk.

AB The reaction rates of 22Ne(alpha, n)25Mg and its competing channel 22Ne(alpha, gamma)26Mg control the production of neutron flux for weak s-process nucleosynthesis in low mass asymptotic giant branch stars and in massive stars with M >= 10M circle dot. The temperature range of interest for these reactions lies between 0.2 and 0.4 GK. However, the rates of these reactions are poorly constrained at these temperatures due to uncertainties in the nuclear properties of several resonance states in the compound nucleus 26Mg, lying within the Gamow window. The present work reports a full R-matrix evaluation of the 22Ne(alpha, n)25Mg and 22Ne(alpha, gamma)26Mg reaction rates using updated nuclear data of 26Mg states. Previous rate evaluation by Adsley et al and R-matrix calculations of Wiescher et al were limited by using narrow resonance approximations and omission of the resonances below Er = 705 keV, respectively. In this work, the R-matrix fit to the available 22Ne(alpha, n)25Mg reaction data is performed by including the contributions of previously neglected resonances below Er = 705 keV and considering the interference effects. The (alpha, n) reaction rate from the present R-matrix evaluations is noticeably higher than the narrow resonance approximation calculations in the temperature range 0.1-0.3 GK. In particular, the present (alpha, n) reaction rate is significantly higher (7.5 - 4.5 times) compared to Adsley et al at 0.2-0.3 GK and approximate to 2 times greater than Wiescher et al at 0.3 GK. The estimated reaction rate ratio of (alpha, n) to (alpha, gamma) in the relevant temperature window 0.2-0.8 GK indicates that the production of neutrons for the s-process is more likely than the radiative alpha capture reaction, compared to the previous estimate by Adsley et al.

AB Ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC) is an innovative service offered by fifth-generation (5G) wireless systems. URLLC enables various mission-critical applications by facilitating reliable and low-latency signal transmission. Apart from reliability and latency, ensuring the security of URLLC data transmission has been a prominent issue in recent years. URLLC uses finite blocklength signals to achieve the stringent reliability and latency requirement which eliminates the possibility of using conventional complex secret key-based cryptographic techniques. In this regard, lightweight security mechanisms like physical layer Security (PLS) have emerged as a powerful alternative to the complex cryptographic security techniques for URLLC by exploiting the randomness of the wireless channel. Therefore, this survey presents a comprehensive and in-depth review of the state-of-the-art PLS enhancements utilized to unleash secure URLLC in 5G and upcoming sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. Moreover, the survey discusses the impact of system design parameters on the PLS of URLLC. It also incorporates a detailed overview of the recent advancements in ensuring PLS for mission-critical applications, URLLC enabling technologies, and Machine Learning (ML) based intelligent PLS schemes for URLLC. Then, for the first time, the survey introduces the extended service class of URLLC in 6G, i.e., Hyper Reliable Low Latency Communication (HRLLC), and provides an outlook on the future security aspects while identifying various promising new technologies that can provide secure HRLLC in 6G. Finally, the survey discusses several key challenges and identifies interesting future research directions for developing efficient PLS schemes for 5G URLLC and HRLLC service in 6G wireless networks.

TI Single-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Scalable Earth-Observing
   Satellite Constellation Operations
SO JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS
LA English
DT Article
AB This work explores single-agent reinforcement learning for the multi-satellite agile Earth-observing scheduling problem. The objective of the problem is to maximize the weighted sum of imaging targets collected and downlinked while avoiding resource constraint violations on board the spacecraft. To avoid the computational complexity associated with multi-agent deep reinforcement learning while creating a robust and scalable solution, a policy is trained in a single satellite environment. This policy is then deployed on board each satellite in a Walker-delta constellation. A global set of targets is distributed to each satellite based on target access. The satellites communicate with one another to determine whether an imaging target is imaged or downlinked. Free communication, line-of-sight communication, and no communication are explored to determine how the communication assumptions and constellation design impact performance. Free communication is shown to produce the best performance, and no communication is shown to produce the worst performance. Line-of-sight communication performance is shown to depend heavily on the design of the constellation and how frequently the satellites can communicate with one another. To explore how higher-level coordination can impact performance, a centralized mixed-integer programming optimization approach to global target distribution is explored and compared to a decentralized approach. A genetic algorithm is also implemented for comparison purposes, and the proposed method is shown to achieve higher reward on average at a fraction of the computational cost.

AB Hydrophobic interaction is a prevalent sorption mechanism of poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in natural and engineered environments. In this study, we combined quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D), atomic force microscope (AFM) with force mapping, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to probe the molecular behavior of PFAS at the hydrophobic interface. On a CH3-terminated self-assembled monolayer (SAM), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) showed similar to 2-fold higher adsorption than perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) that has the same fluorocarbon tail length but a different head group. Kinetic modeling using the linearized Avrami model suggests that the PFNA/PFOS-surface interaction mechanisms can evolve over time. This is confirmed by AFM force-distance measurements, which shows that while the adsorbed PFNA/PFOS molecules mostly lay flat, a portion of them formed aggregates/hierarchical structures of 1-10 nm in size after lateral diffusion on surface. PFOS showed a higher affinity to aggregate than PFNA. Association with air nanobubbles is observed for PFOS but not PFNA. MD simulations further showed that PFNA has a greater tendency than PFOS to have its tail inserted into the hydrophobic SAM, which can enhance adsorption but limit lateral diffusion, consistent with the relative behavior of PFNA/PFOS in QCM and AFM experiments. This integrative QCM-AFM-MD study reveals that the interfacial behavior of PFAS molecules can be heterogeneous even on a relatively homogeneous surface.

ID SOCIAL MEDIA
AB Among popular social media platforms, Reddit stands out for its decentralized approach to moderation and community management. Due to this and its community-based network structure, Reddit provides a unique environment for studying the diffusion of knowledge and beliefs over social media. While assortativity, polarization, and user behavior have been examined within empirical contexts, having the ability to model the impacts of different moderation policies and rules across communities could provide useful insights for limiting the spread of misinformation. In this work, we introduce an agent-based model of Reddit interactions and moderating actions. By simulating interactions at the user level and specifying user-specific attributes, our model allows practitioners to conduct experiments with various types of actors and moderators and study their potential impact on Reddit-facilitated discussions and information diffusion. Additionally, subreddit-specific attributes enable communities to have different standards and thresholds for user conduct. To validate this model, we rely on an empirical dataset of over 100K posts and 800K comments across three U.S. political events in addition to user surveys and studies.

DE Multimodal; Vertical Federated Learning; Traffic Analysis; INDOT Dataset
AB Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging subclass of Artificial Intelligence that decentralizes the learning process. Unlike the well-studied Horizontal Federated Learning (HFL), which requires the feature space of all participants to be the same, the newly emerging Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) allows participants to hold different features, provided the sample space is the same. This unique aspect enables VFL to incorporate features from different data modalities, a capability that has not yet been sufficiently explored. Currently, VFL researchers adapt datasets originally used for HFL by splitting the data vertically, whether it is text, tabular, or image data. In this paper, we extend the application of VFL to multimodal datasets, specifically in the field of Intelligent Transportation. We build models by combining local models from participants holding CCTV image datasets and Traffic flow tabular datasets. Due to the absence of suitable existing datasets, we introduce a new dataset, the INDOT traffic dataset, which also supports sequential training across time and distance. Our experiments demonstrate the efficiency of VFL in the multimodal traffic analysis scenario and aim to expand the scope of VFL research.

AB Drawing is a fundamental skill in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines to express one's reasoning and externalize mental models in problem-solving. Although research has highlighted the effectiveness of drawing as a learning strategy and the importance of drawing accuracy for learning success, little is known about learners' actual drawing process. However, especially in organic chemistry, the investigation of drawing processes is of great importance as generating different representations, such as structural formulas, is inherent to problem-solving in this visual-laden discipline. Resonance structures, for example, are often used to estimate reactive sites in a molecule and to propose reaction pathways. However, this type of representation places a high cognitive demand on learners, which, besides conceptual difficulties, leads to drawing difficulties. To support learners in drawing and using resonance structures in problem-solving, it is necessary to characterize how they generate their drawings. To this end, a qualitative, exploratory study has been conducted to investigate undergraduate students' (N = 20) drawing processes of resonance structures while solving an organic case comparison task. Using eye-tracking, the characteristics regarding the construction of productive and unproductive drawings became visible. Results indicate that unproductive drawings often stem from integrating and connecting unrelated information during the drawing process. Further, the results show that the productivity of a drawing depends on learners' flexibility in information selection. Implications for supporting learners' drawing process and using eye-tracking for characterizing drawing processes in other STEM disciplines are discussed.

AB Because of their higher energy efficiency and environmental friendliness, electrical vehicles (EVs) have recently positioned themselves as one of the most sustainable alternatives to traditional combustion engine vehicles. However, there remain numerous challenges (i.e., lubrication, thermal management, electrical compatibility, and corrosion, among others) that can hamper their performance, efficiency, and reliability, and hence the sustainability of EVs in the long run. Two-dimensional (2D) materials offer impressive multi-functional characteristics, including unusual thermal, electrical, and tribological properties which can beneficially impact the smooth, safe, efficient, and long-lasting operation of EVs. Therefore, in this perspective, we summarize the most recent developments related to 2D materials which can synergistically address tribological, electrical, and thermal management issues and thus enable superior performance, efficiency, and reliability in future EVs. We hope that the highlighted remarkable properties of 2D materials can generate more research efforts in this direction and eventually lead to the development of an EV-based green and sustainable transportation future for generations to come.

AB 3D image reconstruction from a limited number of 2D images has been a long-standing challenge in computer vision and image analysis. While deep learning-based approaches have achieved impressive performance in this area, existing deep networks often fail to effectively utilize the shape structures of objects presented in images. As a result, the topology of reconstructed objects may not be well preserved, leading to the presence of artifacts such as discontinuities, holes, or mismatched connections between different parts. In this paper, we propose a shape-aware network based on diffusion models for 3D image reconstruction, named SADIR, to address these issues. In contrast to previous methods that primarily rely on spatial correlations of image intensities for 3D reconstruction, our model leverages shape priors learned from the training data to guide the reconstruction process. To achieve this, we develop a joint learning network that simultaneously learns a mean shape under deformation models. Each reconstructed image is then considered as a deformed variant of the mean shape. We validate our model, SADIR, on both brain and cardiac magnetic resonance images (MRIs). Experimental results show that our method outperforms the baselines with lower reconstruction error and better preservation of the shape structure of objects within the images.

DE Solar eclipse; Solar K corona; Solar instrumentation
AB We present results of a dual eclipse expedition to observe the solar corona from two sites during the annular solar eclipse of 14 October 2023 using a novel coronagraph designed to be accessible for amateurs and students to build and deploy. The coronagraph (CATEcor) builds on the standardized eclipse observing equipment developed for the Citizen CATE 2024 experiment. The observing sites were selected for likelihood of clear observations, for historic relevance (near the Climax site in the Colorado Rocky Mountains), and for centrality to the annular eclipse path (atop Sandia Peak above Albuquerque, New Mexico). The novel portion of CATEcor is an external occulter assembly that slips over the front of a conventional dioptric telescope, forming a shaded-truss externally occulted coronagraph. CATEcor is specifically designed to be easily constructed in a garage or "makerspace" environment. We successfully observed some bright features in the solar corona to an altitude of approximately 2.25 R circle dot during the annular phases of the eclipse. Future improvements to the design, in progress now, will reduce both stray light and image artifacts; our objective is to develop a design that can be operated successfully by amateur astronomers at sufficient altitude even without the darkened skies of a partial or annular eclipse.

FX This paper is dedicated to the memory of Prof. Jay M. Pasachoff of
   Williams College, who served as mentor to two of us (Seaton '01 &
   Tosolini '23), and whose dedication to eclipse science and outreach
   inspired all of us. We are grateful to many people and organizations who
   helped to make this observation possible. Citizen CATE 2024 is jointly
   funded by the National Science Foundation (Grant Nos. 2231658, 2308305,
   & 2308306), NASA (Grant Nos. 80NSSC21K0798 & 80NSSC23K0946), and
   Southwest Research Institute. The CATEcor telescope occulter was
   developed under internal funding by Southwest Research Institute using
   open-source tools including FreeCAD (https://freecad.org), and the
   expedition was funded by the Citizen CATE 2024 project and by SwRI. The
   Colorado expedition was enabled by free access to the White River
   National Forest, access to which remains one of Colorado's greatest
   assets. Daniel Zietlow assisted greatly with eclipse-day logistics,
   documentation, and outreach activities. David Elmore provided both
   historical documents about, and his own first-hand experience of, the
   Climax Observatory. Scott McIntosh was enormously helpful in our
   attempts to facilitate access to the Climax site. The New Mexico
   expedition was enabled by kind interactions with the Cibola National
   Forest and National Grasslands office, and specifically District Ranger
   Crystal Powell, of the Sandia Ranger District, who clarified access
   conditions and helped us with site selection. We were pleased to
   collaborate both with Windfall Films of London (UK), specifically Joby
   Lubman and his crew, and the Logan School for Creative Learning of
   Denver (CO), specifically Catherine Peterson and her team, in engaging
   students and the general public in the event. We are grateful to the
   PUNCH mission Outreach team, specifically Cherilynn Morrow, for making
   available several important learning tools including the "three-hole
   PUNCH pinhole projector" that we distributed in large numbers.

AB Older adults with Type II Diabetes Mellitus (DM) experience mild cognitive impairment, specifically in the domain of recall/working memory. No consistent causative structural cortical deficits have been identified in persons with DM (PwDM). Memory deficits may be exacerbated in older adult females, who are at the highest risk of cardiovascular decline due to DM. The focus of the current study was to evaluate functional cortical hemodynamic activity during memory tasks in postmenopausal PwDM. Functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) was used to monitor oxyhemoglobin (HbO) and deoxyhemoglobin (HbR) during memory-based tasks in a cross-sectional sample of postmenopausal women with DM. Twenty-one community-dwelling DM females (age = 65 +/- 6 years) and twenty-one age- and sex-matched healthy controls (age = 66 +/- 6 years) were evaluated. Working memory performance (via N-back) was evaluated while study participants donned cortical fNIRS. Health state, metabolic data, and menopausal status data were also collected. Deficits in working memory accuracy were found in the DM group as compared to controls. Differences in HbO responses emerged in the DM group. The DM group exhibited altered PFC activity magnitudes and increased functional cortical activity across ROIs compared to controls. HbO and HbR responses were not associated with worsened health state measures. These data indicate a shift in cortical activity patterns with memory deficits in postmenopausal PwDM. This DM-specific shift of HbO is a novel finding that is unlikely to be detected by fMRI. This underscores the value of using non-MRI-based neuroimaging techniques to evaluate cortical hemodynamic function to detect early mild cognitive impairment.

AB Oxygen ion conductors require high temperatures to exhibit the high ion conductivity needed for practical use. In this work, we related oxygen vacancy formation energy and migration barrier to the electronic structure of perovskites using ab initio simulations. The vacancy formation energy increases with the increasing energy penalty for transferring electrons from oxygen to the highest filled metal states. On the other hand, the migration barrier increases with larger electronic energy penalty for screening the charge that accumulates around the oxygen vacancy. Bringing localized filled electronic states associated with the oxygen vacancy closer to the conduction band or increasing the metal-oxygen band overlap can decrease charge accumulation in the oxygen vacancy and reduce the migration barrier. By investigating the changes in the electronic structure during oxygen migration, the critical role of increasing the charge screening capability of the host lattice local environment in decreasing the migration barrier was further highlighted. Our findings provide new insights into lowering the migration barrier in oxygen ion conductors and trends towards accelerating their discovery.
   Electronic structure signatures of oxygen ion migration highlight new fundamental descriptors of the oxygen migration barrier based on the electronic structure of the local chemical environment.

AB Including children's voices in the design of learning activities and technologies has increasingly become a subject of conversation among researchers and learning designers. Research suggests children have lived experiences that position them as useful contributors in co-designing curricula activities or technologies they will use. However, one significant challenge in participatory co-design is engaging children in the co-design of curricula when they have not yet learned the disciplinary content within the curricula. We present our two-year participatory design-based research study in which we co-designed a Critical Machine Learning educational programme with different groups of children at two after-school centres over two consecutive years. In this paper, we characterize the roles children embodied in two cycles of participatory co-design and how the program's activities impacted these roles. Findings in this study suggest that in two participatory design-based research cycles, children embodied different roles of tester, informant, or designer of both AI learning activities and AI technologies. Based on this design-based research study, we propose that a 'slow research' approach that emphasises trust-building and a deep understanding of children's perspectives can be instrumental in achieving meaningful co-design outcomes.

AB Hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) is frequently employed as a key component of propellant binder in missiles or solid rockets. Understanding its shock response can help us to deepen our understanding of the shock response in its composites. Considering that missiles or solid rockets often need to operate in various temperature environments, investigating the shock wave propagation within the HTPB and its spallation behaviors under different temperatures and impact velocities is critical for understanding its failure modes. By employing large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, we provide a thorough analysis of the shock propagation and spallation strength of the HTPB under different initial temperatures and impact velocities. The quantification of the spallation strength is done by indirect methods based on the acoustic and modified acoustic assumptions and by the direct method that analyzes atomic stress in the spallation region. Our simulation results reveal that the spallation strength is associated with the impact velocity acting on the materials as well as the initial temperature. When the initial temperature is below the glass transition temperature, the spallation strength exhibits a monotonic decrease with increasing impact velocity. In contrast, such monotonicity is not observed above the glass transition temperature. Our findings furnish insights at the molecular level regarding the spallation processes in HTPB under varying impact loadings and temperature conditions, thereby facilitating the design of HTPB materials with enhanced resistance to impact loading.

AB This study focuses on the synthesis of fully renewable polycarbonates (PCs) starting from cellulose-based platform molecules levoglucosenone (LGO) and 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF). These unique bio-based PCs are obtained through the reaction of a citronellol-containing triol (Triol-citro) derived from LGO, with a dimethyl carbonate derivative of BHMF (BHMF-DC). Solvent-free polymerizations are targeted to minimize waste generation and promote an eco-friendly approach with a favorable environmental factor (E-factor). The choice of metal catalyst during polymerization significantly influences the polymer properties, resulting in high molecular weight (up to 755 kDa) when Na2CO3 is employed as an inexpensive catalyst. Characterization using nuclear magnetic resonance confirms the successful incorporation of the furan ring and the retention of the terminal double bond of the citronellol pendant chain. Furthermore, under UV irradiation, the presence of both citronellol and furanic moieties induces singular structural changes, triggering the formation of three distinct structures within the polymer network, a phenomenon herein occurs for the first time in this type of polymer. These findings pave the way to new functional materials prepared from renewable monomers with tunable properties.
   This study explores the synthesis of renewable polycarbonates using both levoglucosenone and 5-hydroxymethyl furfural as renewable platform molecules. A solvent-free polymerization approach with a low E-factor is detailed. The influence of metal catalysts on polymer properties is examined, with Na2CO3 yielding a high molecular weight of 755 kDa. UV irradiation induces unique structural changes within the polymer network.image

AB Objective. A major challenge in designing closed-loop brain-computer interfaces is finding optimal stimulation patterns as a function of ongoing neural activity for different subjects and different objectives. Traditional approaches, such as those currently used for deep brain stimulation, have largely followed a manual trial-and-error strategy to search for effective open-loop stimulation parameters, a strategy that is inefficient and does not generalize to closed-loop activity-dependent stimulation. Approach. To achieve goal-directed closed-loop neurostimulation, we propose the use of brain co-processors, devices which exploit artificial intelligence to shape neural activity and bridge injured neural circuits for targeted repair and restoration of function. Here we investigate a specific type of co-processor called a 'neural co-processor' which uses artificial neural networks and deep learning to learn optimal closed-loop stimulation policies. The co-processor adapts the stimulation policy as the biological circuit itself adapts to the stimulation, achieving a form of brain-device co-adaptation. Here we use simulations to lay the groundwork for future in vivo tests of neural co-processors. We leverage a previously published cortical model of grasping, to which we applied various forms of simulated lesions. We used our simulations to develop the critical learning algorithms and study adaptations to non-stationarity in preparation for future in vivo tests. Main results. Our simulations show the ability of a neural co-processor to learn a stimulation policy using a supervised learning approach, and to adapt that policy as the underlying brain and sensors change. Our co-processor successfully co-adapted with the simulated brain to accomplish the reach-and-grasp task after a variety of lesions were applied, achieving recovery towards healthy function in the range 75%-90%. Significance. Our results provide the first proof-of-concept demonstration, using computer simulations, of a neural co-processor for adaptive activity-dependent closed-loop neurostimulation for optimizing a rehabilitation goal after injury. While a significant gap remains between simulations and in vivo applications, our results provide insights on how such co-processors may eventually be developed for learning complex adaptive stimulation policies for a variety of neural rehabilitation and neuroprosthetic applications.

AB Efforts addressing sludge management, food security, and resource recovery have led to novel approaches in these areas. Electrically assisted conversion of sludge stands out as a promising technology for sewage sludge valorization, producing nitrogen and phosphorus-based fertilizers. The adoption of this technology, which could lead to a fertilizer circular economy, holds the potential to catalyze a transformative change in wastewater treatment facilities toward process intensification, innovation, and sustainability. This paper provides insights into the economic aspects of the technology, policy considerations, and challenges involved in realizing the potential of electrified processes for sludge valorization. To demonstrate the impact of the technology, a case study for its implementation in the United States assuming the municipal wastewater treatment plants market is discussed. It was found that electrically assisted sludge conversion could enable the recovery of nitrogen and phosphorus from waste, representing up to 9% of the nitrogen and 32% of the phosphorus consumption of the U.S. for fertilizer use. This technology also enables full electrification and modularization of the process, thereby presenting significant economic and environmental opportunities.

AB This report describes a detailed study of Ni phosphine catalysts for the Suzuki-Miyaura coupling of dichloropyridines with halogen-containing (hetero)aryl boronic acids. With most phosphine ligands, these transformations afford mixtures of mono- and diarylated cross-coupling products as well as competing oligomerization of the boronic acid. However, a ligand screen revealed that PPh2Me and PPh3 afford high yield and selectivity for monoarylation over diarylation as well as minimal competing oligomerization of the boronic acid. Several key observations were made regarding the selectivity of these reactions, including: (1) phosphine ligands that afford high selectivity for monoarylation fall within a narrow range of Tolman cone angles (between 136 and 157 degrees); (2) more electron-rich trialkylphosphines afford predominantly diarylated products, while less electron-rich di- and triarylphosphines favor monoarylation; (3) diarylation proceeds via intramolecular oxidative addition; and (4) the solvent (MeCN) plays a crucial role in achieving high monoarylation selectivity. Experimental and density functional theory studies suggest that all of these data can be explained based on the reactivity of a key intermediate: a Ni-0-pi complex of the monoarylated product. With larger, more electron-rich trialkylphosphine ligands, this pi complex undergoes intramolecular oxidative addition faster than ligand substitution by the MeCN solvent, leading to selective diarylation. In contrast, with relatively small di- and triarylphosphine ligands, associative ligand substitution by MeCN is competitive with oxidative addition, resulting in the selective formation of monoarylated products. The generality of this method is demonstrated with a variety of dichloropyridines and chloro-substituted aryl boronic acids. Furthermore, the optimal ligand (PPh2Me) and solvent (MeCN) are leveraged to achieve Ni-catalyzed monoarylation of a broader set of dichloroarene substrates.

AB Metamaterials are artificial materials designed to exhibit effective material parameters that go beyond those found in nature. Composed of unit cells with rich designability that are assembled into multiscale systems, they hold great promise for realizing next-generation devices with exceptional, often exotic, functionalities. However, the vast design space and intricate structure-property relationships pose significant challenges in their design. A compelling paradigm that could bring the full potential of metamaterials to fruition is emerging: data-driven design. This review provides a holistic overview of this rapidly evolving field, emphasizing the general methodology instead of specific domains and deployment contexts. Existing research is organized into data-driven modules, encompassing data acquisition, machine learning-based unit cell design, and data-driven multiscale optimization. The approaches are further categorized within each module based on shared principles, analyze and compare strengths and applicability, explore connections between different modules, and identify open research questions and opportunities.
   This review highlights the status and opportunities of data-driven design for metamaterials and multiscale systems, generally built on data acquisition, unit cell design, and multiscale design. Adopting a design-centered perspective, the primary approaches of each module that represent common threads and overarching principles are categorized, connections across modules are articulated, and open research questions and opportunities are disclosed.image

AB The cis- and trans-isomers of a silacycloheptene were selectively synthesized by the alkylation of a silyl dianion, a novel approach to strained cycloalkenes. The trans-silacyclohep-tene (trans-SiCH) was significantly more strained than the cis isomer, as predicted by quantum chemical calculations and confirmed by crystallographic signatures of a twisted alkene. Each isomer exhibited distinct reactivity toward ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP), where only trans-SiCH afforded high molar-mass polymer under enthalpy-driven ROMP. Hypothesizing that the introduction of silicon might result in increased molecular compliance at large extensions, we compared poly(trans-SiCH) to organic polymers by single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS). Force-extension curves from SMFS showed that poly(trans-SiCH) is more easily overstretched than two carbon-based analogues, polycyclooctene and polybutadiene, with stretching constants that agree well with the results of computational simulations.

TI Muon capture on the deuteron in chiral effective field theory
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW C
LA English
DT Article
AB We consider the capture of a muon on a deuteron. An uncertainty analysis of the dominant channels is impor-tant for a careful analysis of forthcoming experimental data. We quantify the theoretical uncertainties of chiral effective-field-theory predictions of the muon-deuteron capture rate from the relevant neutron-neutron partial wave channels in the final state. We study the dependence on the cutoff used to regularize the interactions, low energy constants calibrated using different fitting data and strategies, and truncation of the effective-field-theory expansion of the currents. Combining these approaches gives as an estimate of ⠂& mu;d1/2 = 399.1 & PLUSMN; 7.6 & PLUSMN; 4.4 s-1 for capture from the atomic doublet state, and ⠂& mu;d3/2= 12.31 & PLUSMN; 0.47 & PLUSMN; 0.04 s-1 for capture from the quartet state and the first and second uncertainties given here are due to the effective field theory truncation error and the in the axial

DE Driver behavior; fuel economy
ID SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS; DRIVER; INFORMATION; CONSUMPTION; VEHICLE
AB Drivers have distinctively diverse behaviors when operating vehicles in natural traffic flow, such as preferred pedal position, car-following distance, preview time headway, etc. These highly personalized behavioral variations are known to impact vehicle fuel economy qualitatively. Nevertheless, the quantitative relationship between driving behaviors and vehicle fuel consumption remains obscure. Addressing this critical missing link will contribute to the improvement of transportation sustainability, as well as understanding drivers' behavioral diversity. This study proposed an integrated microscopic driver behavior and fuel consumption model to assess and predict vehicle fuel economy with naturalistic highway and local commuting traffic data. Through extensive Monte Carlo simulations, significant correlation results are revealed between specific individual driving preferences and fuel economy over drivers' frequent commuting routes. Correlation results indicate that the differences in fuel consumption incurred by various driving behaviors, even in the same traffic conditions, can be as much as 29% for a light-duty truck and 15% for a passenger car. A Gaussian Process Regression model is further trained, validated, and tested under different traffic and vehicle conditions to predict fuel consumption based on drivers' personalized behaviors. Such a quantitative and personalized model can be used to identify and recommend fuel-friendly driving behaviors and routes, demonstrating a strong incentive for relevant stakeholders.

AB A carbene-stabilized dithiolene zwitterion (3) activates ammonia, affording 4 & BULL; and 5, through both single-electron transfer (SET) and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). Reaction products were characterized spectroscopically and by single-crystal Xray diffraction. The mechanism of the formation of 4 & BULL; and 5 was probed by experimental and computational methods. This discovery is the first example of metal-free ammonia activation via HAT.

   disease dynamics
AB Networks allow us to describe a wide range of interaction phenomena that occur in complex systems arising in such diverse fields of knowledge as neuroscience, engineering, ecology, finance, and social sciences. Until very recently, the primary focus of network models and tools has been on describing the pairwise relationships between system entities. However, increasingly more studies indicate that polyadic or higher-order group relationships among multiple network entities may be the key toward better understanding of the intrinsic mechanisms behind the functionality of complex systems. Such group interactions can be, in turn, described in a holistic manner by simplicial complexes of graphs. Inspired by these recently emerging results on the utility of the simplicial geometry of complex networks for contagion propagation and armed with a large-scale synthetic social contact network (also known as a digital twin) of the population in the U.S. state of Virginia, in this paper, we aim to glean insights into the role of higher-order social interactions and the associated varying social group determinants on COVID-19 propagation and mitigation measures.

AB The stiffness of soft biological tissues not only depends on the applied deformation, but also on the deformation rate. To model this type of behavior, traditional approaches select a specific time-dependent constitutive model and fit its parameters to experimental data. Instead, a new trend now suggests a machine-learning based approach that simultaneously discovers both the best model and best parameters to explain given data. Recent studies have shown that feed-forward constitutive neural networks can robustly discover constitutive models and parameters for hyperelastic materials. However, feed-forward architectures fail to capture the history dependence of viscoelastic soft tissues. Here we combine a feed-forward constitutive neural network for the hyperelastic response and a recurrent neural network for the viscous response inspired by the theory of quasi-linear viscoelasticity. Our novel rheologically-informed network architecture discovers the time independent initial stress using the feed-forward network and the time-dependent relaxation using the recurrent network. We train and test our combined network using unconfined compression relaxation experiments of passive skeletal muscle and compare our discovered model to a neo Hookean standard linear solid, to an advanced mechanics-based model, and to a vanilla recurrent neural network with no mechanics knowledge. We demonstrate that, for limited experimental data, our new constitutive recurrent neural network discovers models and parameters that satisfy basic physical principles and generalize well to unseen data. We discover a Mooney-Rivlin type two-term initial stored energy function that is linear in the first invariant I1 and quadratic in the second invariant I2 with stiffness parameters of 0.60 kPa and 0.55 kPa. We also discover a Prony-series type relaxation function with time constants of 0.362s, 2.54s, and 52.0s with coefficients of 0.89, 0.05, and 0.03. Our newly discovered model outperforms both the neo Hookean standard linear solid and the vanilla recurrent neural network in terms of prediction accuracy on unseen data. Our results suggest that constitutive recurrent neural networks can autonomously discover both model and parameters that best explain experimental data of soft viscoelastic tissues.

AB In recent years, solvers for finite-element discretizations of linear or linearized saddle-point problems, like the Stokes and Oseen equations, have become well established. There are two main classes of preconditioners for such systems: those based on a block-factorization approach and those based on monolithic multigrid. Both classes of preconditioners have several critical choices to be made in their composition, such as the selection of a suitable relaxation scheme for monolithic multigrid. From existing studies, some insight can be gained as to what options are preferable in low-performance computing settings, but there are very few fair comparisons of these approaches in the literature, particularly for modern architectures, such as GPUs. In this paper, we perform a comparison between a Block-Triangular preconditioner and monolithic multigrid methods with the three most common choices of relaxation scheme - Braess-Sarazin, Vanka, and Schur-Uzawa. We develop a performant Vanka relaxation algorithm for structured-grid discretizations, which takes advantage of memory efficiencies in this setting. We detail the behavior of the various CUDA kernels for the multigrid relaxation schemes and evaluate their individual arithmetic intensity, performance, and runtime. Running a preconditioned FGMRES solver for the Stokes equations with these preconditioners allows us to compare their efficiency in a practical setting. We show that monolithic multigrid can outperform Block-Triangular preconditioning, and that using Vanka or Braess-Sarazin relaxation is most efficient. Even though multigrid with Vanka relaxation exhibits reduced performance on the CPU (up to 100% slower than Braess-Sarazin), it is able to outperform Braess-Sarazin by more than 20% on the GPU, making it a competitive algorithm, especially given the high amount of algorithmic tuning needed for effective Braess-Sarazin relaxation.

AB Myotropes are pharmaceuticals that have recently been developed or are under investigation for the treatment of heart diseases. Myotropes have had varied success in clinical trials. Initial research into myotropes have widely focused on animal models of cardiac dysfunction in comparison with normal animal cardiac physiology-primarily using males. In this study we examined the effect of danicamtiv, which is one type of myotrope within the class of myosin activators, on contractile function in permeabilized (skinned) myocardial strips from male and female Sprague-Dawley rats. We found that danicamtiv increased steady-state isometric force production at sub-maximal calcium levels, leading to greater Ca2+-sensitivity of contraction for both sexes. Danicamtiv did not affect maximal Ca2+-activated force for either sex. Sinusoidal length-perturbation analysis was used to assess viscoelastic myocardial stiffness and cross-bridge cycling kinetics. Data from these measurements did not vary with sex, and the data suggest that danicamtiv slows cross-bridge cycling kinetics. These findings imply that danicamtiv increases force production via increasing cross-bridge contributions to activation of contraction, especially at sub-maximal Ca2+-activation. The inclusion of both sexes in animal models during the formative stages of drug development could be helpful for understanding the efficacy or limitation of a drug's therapeutic impact on cardiac function.

TI Experimental decoy-state asymmetric measurement-device-independent
   quantum key distribution over a turbulent high-loss channel
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
LA English
DT Article
ID SECURITY; SYSTEMS
AB Real -world Bennett-Brassard 1984 quantum key distribution (QKD) systems utilize imperfect devices that introduce vulnerabilities to their security, known as side -channel attacks. Measurement-device-independent (MDI) QKD authorizes an untrusted third party to make measurements and removes all side -channel attacks. The typical implementations of MDI QKD employ nearly symmetric channels which are difficult to realize physically in many practical scenarios such as when asymmetric channel losses are present, normally a consequence of the communication environment. Maritime and satellite-based communications are two such instances in which the channels are characterized by continuously changing losses in different channels. In this work we perform asymmetric MDI QKD in a laboratory environment with simulated turbulence using an acousto-optic modulator to interrogate the performance of free-space quantum communication. Under turbulent conditions, scattering and beam wandering cause intensity fluctuations which decrease the detected signal-to-noise ratio. Using the seven-intensity optimization method proposed by Wang et al. [Phys. Rev. X 9, 041012 (2019)], coupled with prefixed-threshold real -time selection (PRTS), we demonstrate enhancement in the secure key rate under turbulent conditions for finite-size decoy-state MDI QKD. Furthermore, we show that PRTS can yield higher secure key rates, particularly in the high -loss regime.

AB Two-dimensional double perovskites have recently been identified as a potential class of materials for the improvement of halide-perovskite-based solar cell technology. The expanded set of utilizable B- and B '-site cations afforded to double perovskites, combined with tunable structural and electronic properties in two-dimensional perovskites, leads to a highly modifiable set of materials, which have yet to be explored. In this study, we investigate the structural, electronic, and thermoelectric properties of these materials and identify a number of key structure-property relationships governing their performance. In the process, we demonstrate a link between the relative electronegativities of the building components and the resultant geometric structures. Furthermore, we provide insights aimed toward alleviating concerns associated with parity forbidden transitions which plague many double perovskite systems. In addition, we identify a number of two-dimensional double perovskites including the mixed-oxidation state In25Tl75Cl-based system which displays optically active transitions as low as 1.41 eV across the Brillouin zone and indicators pointing toward stable experimental synthesis.

AB Outdoor-to-indoor communications in millimeterwave (mmWave) cellular networks have been one challenging research problem due to the severe attenuation and the high penetration loss caused by propagation characteristics of mmWave signals. We propose a viable solution to implement the outdoor-to-indoor mmWave communication with the aid of an active intelligent transmitting surface (active-ITS), where the active-ITS allows the incoming signal from an outdoor base station (BS) to pass through the surface and be received by indoor users (UEs) after shifting its phase and magnifying its amplitude. Then, the problem of joint precoding of the BS and active-ITS is investigated to maximize the weighted sum-rate (WSR) of the system. An efficient block coordinate descent (BCD) based algorithm is developed to solve it with the suboptimal solutions in nearly closed-forms. In addition, to reduce the size and hardware cost of active-ITSs, we provide a block-amplifying architecture to partially remove the circuit components for power-amplifying, where multiple transmissive-type elements (TEs) in each block share the same power amplifier. Simulations indicate that activeITS has the potential of achieving a given performance with much fewer TEs compared to the passive-ITS under the same total system power consumption, which makes it suitable for application to the space-limited and aesthetic-needed scenario, and the performance degradation caused by the block-amplifying architecture is negligible.

AB Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) has revolutionized our ability to visualize cellular structures, offering unprecedented detail. However, the intricate biophysical principles that underlie SMLM can be daunting for newcomers, particularly undergraduate and graduate students. To address this challenge, we introduce the fundamental concepts of SMLM, providing a solid theoretical foundation. In addition, we have developed an intuitive graphical interface APP that simplifies these core concepts and makes them more accessible for students. This APP clarifies how super-resolved images are fitted and highlights the crucial factors that determine image quality.

AB Nuclear speckles are nuclear membraneless organelles in higher eukaryotic cells playing a vital role in gene expression. Using an in situ reverse transcription-based sequencing method, we study nuclear speckle-associated human transcripts. Our data indicate the existence of three gene groups whose transcripts demonstrate different speckle localization properties: stably enriched in nuclear speckles, transiently enriched in speckles at the pre-messenger RNA stage, and not enriched. We find that stably enriched transcripts contain inefficiently excised introns and that disruption of nuclear speckles specifically affects splicing of speckle-enriched transcripts. We further reveal RNA sequence features contributing to transcript speckle localization, indicating a tight interplay between transcript speckle enrichment, genome organization, and splicing efficiency. Collectively, our data highlight a role of nuclear speckles in both co- and posttranscriptional splicing regulation. Last, we show that genes with stably enriched transcripts are over-represented among genes with heat shock-up-regulated intron retention, hinting at a connection between speckle localization and cellular stress response.

AB Understanding healthcare accessibility, or the ability to access healthcare services, has significant implications for both individual well-being and community equity. However, existing studies seldom account for temporally varying factors such as traffic conditions and hospital schedules, resulting in miscalculation of accessibility. This study addresses this gap by introducing a framework that evaluates accessibility to multi-tier hospitals, factoring in both spatial and temporal aspects, using public transit (PT) and personal vehicles (PVs), and assesses its impact on horizontal and vertical equity. Implemented in Shanghai, China, we employ the Gaussian two-step floating catchment area method for accessibility quantification and utilize map APIs for dynamic travel time data. Our analysis reveals: (i) notable temporal fluctuations in healthcare accessibility, especially for PT, and their significant impact on both horizontal and vertical equity due to varying travel times and hospital schedules; (ii) larger disparities in higher-tier hospital accessibility compared to lower-tier ones; (iii) greater horizontal equity using PV-based accessibility and higher vertical equity using PT-based accessibility. These findings highlight the need to offer customized transit to healthcare facilities, expand telehealth services, incorporate equity in healthcare resource allocation, incentivize healthcare professionals to work in underserved areas, and develop outreach programs to improve accessibility and equity.

AB Image-based localization has been widely used for autonomous vehicles, robotics, augmented reality, etc., and this is carried out by matching a query image taken from a cell phone or vehicle dashcam to a large scale of geo-tagged reference images, such as satellite/aerial images or Google Street Views. However, the problem remains challenging due to the inconsistency between the query images and the large-scale reference datasets regarding various light and weather conditions. To tackle this issue, this work proposes a novel view synthesis framework equipped with deep generative models, which can merge the unique features from the outdated reference dataset with features from the images containing seasonal changes. Our design features a unique scheme to ensure that the synthesized images contain the important features from both reference and patch images, covering seasonable features and minimizing the gap for the image-based localization tasks. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed framework can synthesize the views in various weather and lighting conditions.

AB This study addresses the challenge of social bipedal navigation in a dynamic, human-crowded environment, a research area largely underexplored in legged robot navigation. We present a zonotope-based framework that couples prediction and motion planning for a bipedal ego-agent to account for bidirectional influence with the surrounding pedestrians. This framework incorporates a Social Zonotope Network (SZN), a neural network that predicts future pedestrian reachable sets and plans future socially acceptable reachable set for the ego-agent. SZN generates the reachable sets as zonotopes for efficient reachability-based planning, collision checking, and online uncertainty parameterization. Locomotion-specific losses are added to the SZN training process to adhere to the dynamic limits of the bipedal robot that are not explicitly present in the human crowds data set. These loss functions enable the SZN to generate locomotion paths that are more dynamically feasible for improved tracking. SZN is integrated with a Model Predictive Controller (SZN-MPC) for footstep planning for our bipedal robot Digit. SZN-MPC solves for collision-free trajectory by optimizing through SZN's gradients. Our results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in producing a socially acceptable path, with consistent locomotion velocity, and optimality. The SZN-MPC framework is validated with extensive simulations and hardware experiments. Note to Practitioners-This paper is motivated by the challenge of navigating bipedal robots through dynamic, human-crowded environments in a socially acceptable manner. Existing methods for social navigation often only address obstacle avoidance and are demonstrated on a robot with simple dynamics. This paper proposes the Social Zonotope Network (SZN), a novel neural network that couples pedestrian future trajectory prediction and robot motion planning to facilitate socially aware navigation for bipedal robots such as Digit, designed by Agility Robotics. The social behaviors are learned from real open-sourced pedestrian data using the SZN, which outputs the future predictions as reachable sets for each agent in the environment. The SZN is then integrated into a trajectory optimization problem that takes into account personal space preferences and bipedal robot capabilities to design trajectories that are both collision-free and socially acceptable. This work also highlights the computational efficiency of the SZN design that makes it suitable for real-time integration with motion planners. The framework is validated through extensive simulations and hardware experiments. From a practical standpoint, this research provides a framework that can be applied to bipedal robots to improve automation in human-populated environments such as hospitals, shopping centers, and airports. The framework's ability to automatically adapt to surrounding human movement helps minimize disruptions and ensures that the robot's presence is not a hindrance to the flow of human traffic. Future work will focus on outdoor deployment, which will require onboard perception capabilities to detect surrounding pedestrians.

AB Scheduling multiple federated learning (FL) models within a distributed network, especially in large-scale scenarios, poses significant challenges since it involves solving NP-hard mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problems. However, it's imperative to optimize participant selection and learning rate determination for these FL models to avoid excessive training costs and prevent resource contention. While some existing methods focus solely on optimizing a single global FL model, others struggle to achieve optimal solutions as the problem grows more complex. In this paper, exploiting the potential of quantum computing, we introduce the Hybrid Quantum-Classical Benders' Decomposition (HQCBD) algorithm to effectively tackle the joint MINLP optimization problem for multi-model FL training. HQCBD combines quantum and classical computing to solve the joint participant selection and learning scheduling problem. It decomposes the optimization problem into a master problem with binary variables and small subproblems with continuous variables, then leverages the strengths of both quantum and classical computing to solve them respectively and iteratively. Furthermore, we propose the Hybrid Quantum-Classical Multiple-cuts Benders' Decomposition (MBD) algorithm, which utilizes the inherent capabilities of quantum algorithms to produce multiple cuts in each round, to speed up the proposed HQCBD algorithm. Extensive simulation on the commercial quantum annealing machine demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed methods (both HQCBD and MBD), with improvements of up to 70.3% in iterations and 81% in computation time over the classical Benders' decomposition algorithm on classical CPUs, even at modest scales.

AB When a hovering hummingbird performs a rapid escape manoeuvre in response to a perceived threat from the front side, its body may go through simultaneous pitch, yaw and roll rotations. In this study, we examined the inertial coupling of the three-axis body rotations and its effect on the flight mechanics of the manoeuvre using analyses of high-speed videos as well as high-fidelity computational modelling of the aerodynamics and inertial forces. We found that while a bird's pitch-up was occurring, inertial coupling between yaw and roll helped slow down and terminate the pitch, thus serving as a passive control mechanism for the manoeuvre. Furthermore, an inertial coupling between pitch-up and roll can help accelerate yaw before the roll-yaw coupling. Different from the aerodynamic mechanisms that aircraft and animal flyers typically rely on for flight control, we hypothesize that inertial coupling is a built-in mechanism in the flight mechanics of hummingbirds that helps them achieve superb aerial agility.

AB Magnetic reconnection is regarded as the mechanism for the rapid release of magnetic energy stored in active regions during solar flares, and quantitative measurements of the magnetic reconnection rate are essential for understanding solar flares. In the context of the standard two-ribbon flare model, we derive the coronal magnetic reconnection rate of the M6.5 flare on 2015 June 22 in two terms, reconnection flux change rate and reconnection electric field, both of which can be obtained from observations of the flare morphology. Data used include a sequence of chromospheric H alpha images with unprecedented resolution during the flare from the Visual Imaging Spectrometer of the Goode Solar Telescope (GST) at the Big Bear Solar Observatory and a preflare line-of-sight photospheric magnetogram from the GST Near-InfraRed Imaging Spectropolarimeter along with hard X-ray data from the Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager. The temporal correlation between the magnetic reconnection rate and nonthermal emission is found, and the variation of the reconnection electric field is mainly determined by the ribbon speed, not by the local magnetic field encountered by the ribbon front. Spatially, the hard X-ray source overlaps with the location of the strongest electric field obtained at the same time. The ribbon motion shows abundant fine structures, including a local acceleration at the location of a light bridge with a weaker magnetic field.

AB Bi1-xSbx alloys are classic thermoelectric materials for near-cryogenic applications. Despite more than half a century of study, unraveling the underlying transport physics within this space has been nontrivial due to the complex electronic structure, disorder, and small bandgap within these alloys. Furthermore, as Peltier coolers, Bi1-xSbx alloys operate in a bipolar regime; as such, understanding the impact of minority carriers is critical for further improvements in device performance. This study unites first principles calculations with low-temperature experimental measurements to create a generalized model for transport within semiconducting Bi-Sb alloys. Our exploration reveals the interplay between the complex, degenerate valence band structure with the extremely light conduction bands. By building a hybrid computational/experimental model, an understanding of both the electron and hole relaxation times emerges both as a function of temperature and energy. Special quasi-random supercell calculations reveal that, despite significant atomic disorder, the electronic band structures within the alloy remains largely unaffected and electron-phonon scattering dominates. For charge carriers near the band edges, the relaxation times are thus extremely long, consistent with cyclotronic behavior appearing at low magnetic fields ( << 1 T). Modeling thermoelectric performance suggests that the valence band edge deformation potential is significantly weaker and highlights the potential for p-type compositions to meet or exceed the current n-type alloys.

AB Job loss is a common and disruptive life event. It is known to have numerous longterm negative effects on financial, health, and social outcomes. While the negative effects of becoming unemployed on health and well-being are well understood, the influence of job loss on financial decisions has received little attention. Across a largescale survey (N = 37,854), spending data from a bank (N = 404,470), and two online experiments (total N = 1,403), we find that job loss increases financial risk taking. First, in survey data, job loss is associated with elevated levels of self-reported financial risk-taking and lottery ticket purchases. Next, using administrative data from a large bank, we find consistent causal evidence of the influence of job loss on gambling spending. Although total spending decreases after job loss, gambling spending is less affected than our control categories. Finally, we turn to two incentive-compatible manipulations of job loss operationalized in a lab setting. We find that this experimental manipulation increases the take-up of financial risks. The current finding that job loss increases financial risk-taking could accentuate long-term negative financial effects of job loss.

AB With increasingly strict water regulations, the removal of toxic organic pollutants from industrial wastewaters has become a critical challenge. Herein, a series of novel ZnO-SnSe composite-based photocatalysts were effectively synthesized by an inexpensive, facile chemical process. The prepared composites were analyzed thoroughly by utilizing different techniques, and their physiochemical characteristics were compared with pure ZnO rods and SnSe nanoparticles. X-ray diffraction (XRD) data showed the existence of a hexagonal wurtzite phase of ZnO and an orthorhombic structure of SnSe. The average crystallite sizes of ZnO and SnSe were determined to be 37 and 16 nm, while for the composite samples, the size varied between 20 and 26 nm, respectively. The purity of the samples was confirmed through an elemental compositional study using energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX). Field emission scanning electron micrographs (FESEM) showed that ZnO appeared to be rod-shaped with random orientation. Similarly, SnSe was composed of agglomerated particles. The microstructure of ZnO-SnSe composites showed the coexistence of both nanoparticles and rod-like structures. The PL spectra revealed defects associated with oxygen vacancies, which were dominant factors for the enhanced photocatalytic activities. The absorption spectra and band gap energies of ZnO-SnSe composites revealed a red shift compared to pure ZnO rods. The band gap values were reduced from 3.2 eV (pure ZnO) to 1.9 eV by increasing the concentration of SnSe in the composites. The prepared samples were tested for the visible light-mediated decomposition of methylene blue (MB) with and without H2O2. The ZnO-SnSe composites showed a significantly enhanced photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue compared to the pure ZnO and SnSe, achieving a degradation efficiency of over 98% in 300 min (without H2O2) and 97% in 160 min of exposure time (with H2O2). Furthermore, the degradation rate, determined via the Langmuir-Hinshelwood model, increased from 3.38 x 10(-3) to 1.12 x 10(-2) min(-1) for ZnO-SnSe composites. The scavenger studies elucidated that <bold>center dot</bold>OH radicals and holes were primarily responsible for the enhanced photodegradation of MB.

AB Proteins have evolved to function in an aqueous environment. Collagen, which provides the bodily scaffold for animals, has a special need to retain its integrity. This need was addressed early on, as intact collagen has been detected in dinosaur fossils, even though peptide bonds have a half-life of only similar to 500 years in a neutral aqueous solution. We sought to discover the physicochemical basis for this remarkable resistance to hydrolysis. Using experimental and computational methods, we found that a main-chain acyl group can be protected from hydrolysis by an O<middle dot><middle dot><middle dot>C=O n ->pi* interaction with a neighboring acyl group. These interactions engage virtually every peptide bond in a collagen triple helix. This protection, which arises from the Pauli exclusion principle, could underlie the preservation of ancient collagen.

AB Existing Federated Learning (FL) methods are highly influenced by the training data distribution. In the single global model FL systems, users with highly non-IID data do not improve the global model, and neither does the global model work well on their local data distribution. Even with the clustering-based FL approaches, not all participants get clustered adequately enough for the models to fulfill their local demands. In this work, we design a modified subjective logic-based FL system utilizing the distribution-based similarity among users. Each participant has complete control over their own aggregated model, with handpicked contributions from other participants. The existing clustered model only satisfies a subset of clients, while our individual aggregated models satisfy all the clients. We design a decentralized FL approach, which functions without a trusted central server; the communication and computation overhead is distributed among the clients. We also develop a layer-wise secret-sharing scheme to amplify privacy. We experimentally show that our approach improves the performance of each participant's aggregated model on their local distribution over the existing single global model and clustering-based approach.

AB Light bridges (LBs) are narrow structures dividing sunspot umbra, and their role in active region evolution is yet to be explored. We investigated the magnetic structure of the two LBs: a narrow LB (with width & SIM;810 km) and a considerably wider LB (2475 km) in the active region NOAA 12371. We employed: (1) the high-spatial-resolution spectropolarimetric data obtained by the Near InfraRed Imaging Spectropolarimeter (NIRIS) of the 1.6 m Goode Solar Telescope (GST) for studying the magnetic structure at the photosphere, and (2) the nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) models, extrapolated from both the photospheric magnetogram from GST/NIRIS and from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory, for studying the three-dimensional (3D) magnetic structure on a larger scale. Our observations reveal the presence of a field-free (or, more precisely, weak-field) region and the different velocity structures inside the two LBs. Analysis of the 3D NLFFF model shows a low-lying magnetic canopy as well as the enhanced current system above the LBs. The substantial difference between the LBs and the umbrae is found in the overall magnetic topology in that the field lines emanating from the two LBs are more twisted than that from the neighboring umbrae.

DT Letter
ID GROWTH
AB AlN Schottky barrier diodes with low ideality factor (<1.2), low differential ON-resistance (<0.6 m Omega cm(2)), high current density (>5 kA cm(-2)), and high breakdown voltage (680 V) are reported. The device structure consisted of a two-layer, quasi-vertical design with a lightly doped AlN drift layer and a highly doped Al0.75Ga0.25N ohmic contact layer grown on AlN substrates. A combination of simulation, current-voltage measurements, and impedance spectroscopy analysis revealed that the AlN/AlGaN interface introduces a parasitic electron barrier due to the conduction band offset between the two materials. This barrier was found to limit the forward current in fabricated diodes. Further, we show that introducing a compositionally-graded layer between the AlN and the AlGaN reduces the interfacial barrier and increases the forward current density of fabricated diodes by a factor of 10(4).

AB Astrocytes release numerous factors known to contribute to the process of synaptogenesis, yet knowledge about the signals that control their release is limited. We hypothesized that neuron-derived signals stimulate astrocytes, which respond to neurons through the modulation of astrocyte-released synaptogenic factors. Here we investigate the effect of cholinergic stimulation of astrocytes on synaptogenesis in co-cultured neurons. Using a culture system where primary rat astrocytes and primary rat neurons are first grown separately allowed us to independently manipulate astrocyte cholinergic signaling. Subsequent co-culture of pre-stimulated astrocytes with naive neurons enabled us to assess how prior stimulation of astrocyte acetylcholine receptors uniquely modulates neuronal synapse formation. Pre-treatment of astrocytes with the acetylcholine receptor agonist carbachol increased the expression of synaptic proteins, the number of pre- and postsynaptic puncta, and the number of functional synapses in hippocampal neurons after 24 h in co-culture. Astrocyte secretion of the synaptogenic protein thrombospondin-1 increased after cholinergic stimulation and inhibition of the receptor for thrombospondins prevented the increase in neuronal synaptic structures. Thus, we identified a novel mechanism of neuron-astrocyte-neuron communication, where neuronal release of acetylcholine stimulates astrocytes to release synaptogenic proteins leading to increased synaptogenesis in neurons. This study provides new insights into the role of neurotransmitter receptors in developing astrocytes and into our understanding of the modulation of astrocyte-induced synaptogenesis.

AB Metallic nanowires are widely employed as small-scale structural materials due to their characteristically small volume and high strength compared with their bulk counterparts. Nowadays, the mechanical properties of nanowires in pure metals are well understood with the help of experiments and simulations. However, the deformation of nanowires in metallic alloys remains elusive. In recent years, a new class of alloys called refractory multi-principal element alloys (RMPEAs) emerged. RMPEAs are alloys that form solid solution phases and consist of three or more principal elements, most of which are refractory metals. In this paper, we perform atomistic simulations to investigate the uniaxial deformation of nanowires in 16 body-centered cubic RMPEAs. For each RMPEA, three nanowires consisting of atoms randomly distributed in three different ways are used. The main finding is that dislocation slips on {110} planes and twinning on {112} planes, respectively, control the compressive and tensile plastic deformation of the nanowires. To provide references, we also study the deformation of nanowires in natural and A-atom potential-based artificial pure metals. Results show that the deformation of RMPEA nanowires cannot be predicted by simply extrapolating from those of pure metal nanowires, highlighting the significance of directly simulating RMPEAs using multiple random atomic structures. It is also found that RMPEAs possess a reduced tension-compression asymmetry compared with pure metals, regardless of the underlying plastic deformation mechanism.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB This review aims to give a collective analysis of ionictransportmechanisms through the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) in lithium-ionbatteries. In electrochemical cells, the SEI is the least understoodand most important complex thin layer that forms on electrodes whenthey come in contact with electrolytes. Though the SEI is the keyfactor in any electrochemical cell, the complete picture of the SEIis still fuzzy because of its diverse and dynamic nature. To addressthe complexity of this interphase, the fabric of this review is arrangedin such a way that each component of the SEI is separately analyzedby means of its chemical structure and the possible diffusion mechanism.Since most of the studies about ionic transport through the SEI arebased on first-principles studies, a section of this review is devotedto discussing the theoretical concepts of ionic transport. Further,this review has audited other possible means of ionic transport occurringthrough grain boundaries including open channels. A brief overviewof the electronic conductivity of SEI components is also includedherewith.

AB Adaptive radiations are characterized by rapid ecological diversification and speciation events, leading to fuzzy species boundaries between ecologically differentiated species. Adaptive radiations are therefore key systems for understanding how species are formed and maintained, including the role of de novo mutations versus preexisting variation in ecological adaptation and the genome-wide consequences of hybridization events. For example, adaptive introgression, where beneficial alleles are transferred between lineages through hybridization, may fuel diversification in adaptive radiations and facilitate adaptation to new environments. In this study, we employed whole-genome resequencing data to investigate the evolutionary origin of hummingbird-pollinated flowers and to characterize genome-wide patterns of phylogenetic discordance and introgression in Penstemon subgenus Dasanthera, a small and diverse adaptive radiation of plants. We found that magenta hummingbird-adapted flowers have apparently evolved twice from ancestral blue-violet bee-pollinated flowers within this radiation. These shifts in flower color are accompanied by a variety of inactivating mutations to a key anthocyanin pathway enzyme, suggesting that independent de novo loss-of-function mutations underlie the parallel evolution of this trait. Although patterns of introgression and phylogenetic discordance were heterogenous across the genome, a strong effect of gene density suggests that, in general, natural selection opposes introgression and maintains genetic differentiation in gene-rich genomic regions. Our results highlight the importance of both de novo mutation and introgression as sources of evolutionary change and indicate a role for de novo mutation in driving parallel evolution in adaptive radiations.

AB While High-Performance Computing (HPC) resources are powerful for tackling complex, computationally intensive analysis and modeling problems, access to these resources varies across disciplines. Domain scientists in a variety of fields such as social and environmental sciences often lack in-depth technical skills (e.g., familiarity with terminal, knowledge of job schedulers) to effectively utilize HPC resources, hindering desired research. In this context, CyberGIS-Compute is a middleware toolkit designed to democratize HPC access with the main goal of enabling domain scientists in diverse fields to solve computationally intensive problems. A key challenge facing model developers on CyberGIS-Compute is to create a containerized software environment for their models. Domain experts unfamiliar with HPC are generally unfamiliar with containerization technologies (e.g., Docker, Singularity) and thus unable to create/test containers to execute their models. But if they have access to science gateways, they would want to use these familiar software environments on HPC resources. This paper describes a novel approach to integrating the Cern Virtual Machine File System (CVMFS) into CyberGIS-Compute to provide consistent software environments across science gateways and HPC resources.

AB Basement membranes are thin strong sheets of extracellular matrix. They provide mechanical and biochemical support to epithelia, muscles, nerves, and blood vessels, among other tissues. The mechanical properties of basement membranes are conferred in part by Collagen IV (Col4), an abundant protein of basement membranes that forms an extensive two-dimensional network through head-to-head and tail-to-tail interactions. After the Col4 network is assembled into a basement membrane, it is crosslinked by the matrix-resident enzyme Perox-idasin to form a large covalent polymer. Peroxidasin and Col4 crosslinking are highly conserved throughout the animal kingdom, indicating they are important, but homozygous mutant mice have mild phenotypes. To explore the role of Peroxidasin, we analyzed mutants in Drosophila, including a new CRISPR-generated catalytic null, and found that homozygotes were mostly lethal with 13 % viable escapers. Mouse mutants also show semi-lethality, with Mendelian analysis demonstrating-50 % lethality and-50 % escapers. Despite the strong mutations, the homozygous fly and mouse escapers had low but detectable levels of Col4 crosslinking, indicating the existence of inefficient alternative crosslinking mechanisms, probably responsible for the viable escapers. Fly mutant phenotypes are consistent with decreased basement membrane stiffness. Interestingly, we found that even after basement membranes are assembled and crosslinked in wild-type animals, continuing Peroxidasin activity is required in adults to maintain tissue stiffness over time. These results suggest that Peroxidasin crosslinking may be more important than previously appreciated.

AB The field of machine learning-based interatomic potentials (ML-IAPs) has seen increasing development in recent years. In this work, we compare three widely used ML-IAPs-the moment tensor potential (MTP), the spectral neighbor analysis potential (SNAP), and the tabulated Gaussian approximation potential (tabGAP)with a conventional non-ML-IAP, the embedded atom method (EAM) potential. We evaluated these potentials on the basis of their accuracy and efficiency in determining basic structural parameters and Peierls stress under equivalent conditions. Three tungsten (W)-based alloys (Mo-W, Nb-W, and Ta-W) are considered, and their lattice parameter, formation energy, elastic tensor, and Peierls stress of edge dislocation are calculated. Compared with DFT results, MTP demonstrates the highest accuracy in predicting the lattice parameter and the best computational efficiency among the three ML-IAPs, while tabGAP accurately predicts two independent elastic constants, C 11 and C 12. Despite being the slowest, SNAP shows the highest accuracy in predicting the third independent elastic constant C 44 and its Peierls stress value is comparable to that based on MTP.

AB We introduce Geometric Neural Operators (GNPs) for data-driven deep learning of geometric features for tasks in non-euclidean settings. We present a formulation for accounting for geometric contributions along with practical neural network architectures and factorizations for training. We then demonstrate how GNPs can be used (i) to estimate geometric properties, such as the metric and curvatures of surfaces, (ii) to approximate solutions of geometric partial differential equations on manifolds, and (iii) to solve Bayesian inverse problems for identifying manifold shapes. These results show a few ways GNPs can be used for incorporating the roles of geometry in the data-driven learning of operators.

AB In this study, a widely used colloid of Creighton AgNPs (ORI, 1-100 nm, mostly <= 40 nm, similar to 10 mu g mL(-1)) was rapidly manipulated via tangential flow filtration (TFF) for highly reproducible surface-enhanced (resonance) Raman spectroscopy (SE(R)RS) experiments down to the single-molecule (SM) level. The quasi-spherical AgNPs were size-selected, purified, and concentrated in two TFF fractions of a cutoff diameter of similar to 40 nm: AgNP <= 40 (similar to 900 mu g mL(-1)) and AgNP >= 40 (similar to 100 mu g mL(-1)). The SE(R)S-based sensing capabilities of the two TFF fractions were then tested under pre-resonance (632.8 nm) and resonance (532.1 nm) excitation conditions for rhodamine 6G (R6G, 10(-6)-10(-15) M). Both TFF isolates, AgNP <= 40 and AgNP >= 40, were more effective in adsorbing the R6G analyte (>= 91%) than the original colloid (>= 78%) at submonolayer coverages. Furthermore, the surface enhancement factors (SEF) of the two TFF fractions were markedly superior to those of ORI under all excitation conditions. SERS at 632.8 nm: only AgNP >= 40 enabled the detection of R6G at 10(-9) M and produced the largest SEF (2.1 x 10(6)). SE(R)RS and SM-SERRS at 532.1 nm: AgNP >= 40 gave rise to the largest SEF values (2.5 x 10(10)) corresponding to the SM regime down to 10(-15) M of R6G. Nevertheless, AgNP <= 40 compensated for the size-dependence of the electromagnetic enhancements by an increase in the silver concentration, which led to SEF values comparable to those of AgNP >= 40 through additional resonance enhancements. TFF resulted into a similar to 100-fold increase (AgNP <= 40) in the number of negatively charged AgNPs that were available to electrostatically bridge R6G cations and form SERRS "hot-spots" (AgNP-R6G-AgNP) within the focal volume. Evidently, the interplay between AgNP size, AgNP concentration, and excitation wavelength governs the SE(R)RS enhancements. This study demonstrated that TFF can facilitate the ecofriendly isolation of spherical AgNPs of controlled morphological and plasmonic properties for further enhancing their sensing capabilities as SE(R)RS substrates.

AB The advancement of satellite-based quantum networks shows promise in transforming global communication infrastructure by establishing a secure and reliable quantum Internet. These networks use optical signals from satellites to ground stations to distribute high-fidelity quantum entanglements over long distances, overcoming the limitations of traditional terrestrial systems. However, the complexity of satellite-based entanglement distribution and terrestrial quantum swapping in the integrated network requires joint optimization with satellite assignment, resource allocation, and path selection. To address this challenge, we introduce a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm to solve the optimization problem by leveraging the strengths of both quantum and classical computing. The original problem is decomposed into a master problem and several subproblems using Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition and linearization techniques. Through experiments, this study demonstrates the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed methods in optimizing large-scale networks and managing qubit usage compared to the classical optimization techniques. The findings provide valuable insights for designing and implementing satellite-based entanglement distribution in quantum networks, paving the way for a secure global quantum communication infrastructure.

AB This work analyzes the bifunctional activity of a binuclear two-dimensional metal-organic framework fragment (2D -SA) utilizing ab initio spin -polarized density functional theory calculations. Cobalt, iron, and a combination of the two metals were simulated due to their history with promising oxygen reduction/oxygen evolution reactions (ORR/OER) activity. The favorable reaction pathways of both the ORR and OER have been realized including the addition of pristine/doped graphene substrate. The Co-2D-SAs had the best performance toward OER only, while the Fe-2D-SAs were favorable toward ORR. The results show that when the bimetallic Co/Fe-2D-SA was supported by graphene, both the ORR overpotential of the Fe site and the OER overpotential of the Co site were found to be the best for the bifunctional activity. This superior bifunctional activity is attributed to both the substrate effect and cooperative agreement between iron and cobalt in the bimetallic 2D -SA by adjusting their spin states due to the antiferromagnetic coupling of the binuclear sites.

TI Electric field tuning of a nickel zinc ferrite resonator by non-linear
   magnetoelectric effects
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
ID SURFACE; FILTER
AB The nature of nonlinear magnetoelectric (NLME) effect has been investigated at room-temperature in a single-crystal Zn substituted nickel ferrite. Tuning of the frequency of magnetostatic surface wave (MSSW) modes under an applied pulsed DC electric field/current has been utilized to probe the effect. The frequencies of the modes at 8-20 GHz were found to decrease by similar to 400 MHz for an applied DC power P of similar to 100 mW and the frequency shift was the same for all of the MSSW modes and linearly proportional to P. A model is proposed for the effect and the NLME phenomenon was interpreted in terms of a reduction in the saturation magnetization due to the DC current. The decrease of magnetization with applied electric power, estimated from data on mode frequency versus P, was -2.50 G/mW. The frequency tuning efficiency of the MSSW modes due to NLME effects in the ferrite resonator was found to be 4.1 MHz/mW which is an order of magnitude higher than the shift reported for M-type strontium and barium hexaferrite resonators investigated earlier. The spinel ferrite resonator discussed here has the potential for miniature, electric field tunable, planar microwave devices for the 8-20 GHz frequency range.

AB Task and motion planning (TAMP) integrates high-level task planning and low-level motion planning to equip robots with the autonomy to effectively reason over long-horizon, dynamic tasks. Optimization-based TAMP focuses on hybrid optimization approaches that define goal conditions via objective functions and are capable of handling open-ended goals, robotic dynamics, and physical interaction between the robot and the environment. Therefore, optimization-based TAMP is particularly suited to solve highly complex, contact-rich locomotion and manipulation problems. This survey provides a comprehensive review on optimization-based TAMP, covering first, planning domain representations, including action description languages and temporal logic, second, individual solution strategies for components of TAMP, including AI planning and trajectory optimization (TO), and finally, the dynamic interplay between logic-based task planning and model-based TO. A particular focus of this survey is to highlight the algorithm structures to efficiently solve TAMP, especially hierarchical and distributed approaches. In addition, the survey emphasizes the synergy between the classical methods and contemporary learning-based innovations, such as large language models. Furthermore, the future research directions for TAMP is discussed in this survey, highlighting both algorithmic and application-specific challenges.

AB Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is an emerging noninvasive molecular imaging modality with high sensitivity and specificity, exceptional linear quantitative ability, and potential for successful applications in clinical settings. Computed tomography (CT) is typically combined with the MPI image to obtain more anatomical information. Herein, a deep learning-based approach for MPI-CT image segmentation is presented. The dataset utilized in training the proposed deep learning model is obtained from a transgenic mouse model of breast cancer following administration of indocyanine green (ICG)-conjugated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoworms (NWs-ICG) as the tracer. The NWs-ICG particles progressively accumulate in tumors due to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. The proposed deep learning model exploits the advantages of the multihead attention mechanism and the U-Net model to perform segmentation on the MPI-CT images, showing superb results. In addition, the model is characterized with a different number of attention heads to explore the optimal number for our custom MPI-CT dataset.
   The use of the multihead attention mechanism is proposed to enhance the U-Net model's capability to perform segmentation on magnetic particle imaging (MPI)-computed tomography (CT) images of a transgenic mouse with breast tumors, showing encouraging results. The mouse is injected with promising tumor-targeting nanoparticles, namely indocyanine green-conjugated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoworms (NWs-ICG) as an MPI tracer.image (c) 2024 WILEY-VCH GmbH

ID DESIGN; POWER
AB An important goal of modern scheduling systems is to efficiently manage power usage. In energy-efficient scheduling, the operating system controls the speed at which a machine is processing jobs with the dual objective of minimizing energy consumption and optimizing the quality of service cost of the resulting schedule. Since machine-learned predictions about future requests can often be learned from historical data, a recent line of work on learning-augmented algorithms aims to achieve improved performance guarantees by leveraging predictions. In particular, for energy-efficient scheduling, Bamas et. al. [NeurIPS '20] and Antoniadis et. al. [SWAT '22] designed algorithms with predictions for the energy minimization with deadlines problem and achieved an improved competitive ratio when the prediction error is small while also maintaining worst-case bounds even when the prediction error is arbitrarily large.
   In this paper, we consider a general setting for energy-efficient scheduling and provide a flexible learning-augmented algorithmic framework that takes as input an offline and an online algorithm for the desired energy-efficient scheduling problem. We show that, when the prediction error is small, this framework gives improved competitive ratios for many different energy-efficient scheduling problems, including energy minimization with deadlines, while also maintaining a bounded competitive ratio regardless of the prediction error. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that this framework achieves an improved performance on real and synthetic datasets.

AB Despite global warming, the sea surface temperature (SST) in the subpolar North Atlantic has decreased since the 1900s. This local cooling, known as the North Atlantic cold blob, signifies a unique role of the subpolar North Atlantic in uptaking heat and hence impacts downstream weather and climate. However, a lack of observational records and their constraints on climate models leave the North Atlantic cold blob formation mechanism inconclusive. Using simulations from phase 6 of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, we assess the primary processes driving the North Atlantic cold blob within individual models and whether the mechanisms are consistent across models. We show that 11 out of 32 models, which we call "Cold Blob" models, simulate the subpolar North Atlantic cooling over 1900-2014. Further analyzing the heat budget of the subpolar North Atlantic SST shows that models have distinct mechanisms of cold blob formation. While 4 of the 11 Cold Blob models indicate decreased oceanic heat transport convergence (OHTC) as the key mechanism, another four models suggest changes in radiative processes making predominant contributions. The contribution of OHTC and radiative processes is comparable in the remaining three models. Such a model disagreement on the mechanism of cold blob formation may be associated with simulated base-state Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) strength, which explains 39% of the intermodel spread in the contribution of OHTC to the simulated cold blob. Models with a stronger base-state AMOC suggest a greater role of OHTC, whereas those with a weaker base-state AMOC indicate that radiative processes are more responsible. This model discrepancy suggests that the cold blob formation mechanism diagnosed from single model should be interpreted with caution.

AB The high-redshift galaxy UV luminosity function (UVLF) has become essential for understanding the formation and evolution of the first galaxies. Yet, UVLFs only measure galaxy abundances, giving rise to a degeneracy between the mean galaxy luminosity and its stochasticity. Here, we show that upcoming clustering measurements with the JWST, as well as with Roman, will be able to break this degeneracy, even at redshifts z greater than or similar to 10. First, we demonstrate that current Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) measurements of the galaxy bias at z similar to 4-6 point to a relatively tight halo-galaxy connection, with low stochasticity. Then, we show that the larger UVLFs observed by JWST at z greater than or similar to 10 can be explained with either a boosted average UV emission or an enhanced stochasticity. These two models, however, predict different galaxy biases, which are potentially distinguishable in JWST and Roman surveys. Galaxy-clustering measurements, therefore, will provide crucial insights into the connection between the first galaxies and their dark-matter haloes, and identify the root cause of the enhanced abundance of z greater than or similar to 10 galaxies revealed with JWST during its first year of operations.

AB As demonstrated by the Soft Robotics Toolkit Platform, compliant robotics pose an exciting educational opportunity. Underwater robotics using soft undulating fins is an expansive research topic with applications such as exploration of underwater life or replicating 3d swarm behavior. To make this research area accessible for education we developed Educational Soft Underwater Robot with Electromagnetic Actuation (ESURMA), a humanoid soft underwater robot. We achieved advances in simplicity, modularity, and performance by implementing electromagnetic actuation into the caudal fin. An electromagnet, including electronics, is placed in a waterproof housing, and permanent magnets are embedded in a soft silicone cast tail. The force from their magnetic interaction results in a bending movement of the tail. The magnetic actuation is simple to implement and requires no mechanical connection between the actuated component and the electrically controlled coil. This enables robust waterproofing and makes the device fully modular. Thanks to the direct and immediate transmission of force, experimental flapping frequencies of 14Hz were achieved, an order of magnitude higher compared to pneumatically actuated tails. The completely silent actuation of the caudal fin enables a maximum swimming speed of 14.3cm/s. With its humanoid shape, modular composition, and cost efficiency ESURMA represents an attractive platform for education and demonstrates an alternative method of actuating soft structures.

AB To strike a balance between modeling accuracy and computational efficiency for simulations of ultrasound waves in soft tissues, we derive a pseudodifferential factorization of the wave operator with fractional attenuation. This factorization allows us to approximately solve the Helmholtz equation via one-way (transmission) or two-way (transmission and reflection) sweeping schemes tailored to high-frequency wave fields. We provide explicitly the three highest order terms of the pseudodifferential expansion to incorporate the well-known square-root first order symbol for wave propagation, the zeroth order symbol for amplitude modulation due to changes in wave speed and damping, and the next symbol to model fractional attenuation. We also propose wide-angle Pade'\ approximations for the pseudodifferential operators corresponding to these three highest order symbols. Our analysis provides insights regarding the role played by the frequency and the Pade\' approximations in the estimation of error bounds. We also provide a proof-of-concept numerical implementation of the proposed method and test the error estimates numerically.

AB lambda-RhO2, a prototype 4d transition metal oxide, has been prepared by the oxidative delithiation of spinel LiRh2O4 using ceric ammonium nitrate. Average-structure studies of this RhO2 polytype, including synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction and electron diffraction, indicate the room-temperature structure to be tetragonal, in space group I4(1)/amd, with a first-order structural transition to cubic Fd3m at T = 345 K on warming. Synchrotron X-ray pair distribution function analysis and Li-7 solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance measurements suggest that the room-temperature structure displays local Rh-Rh bonding. The formation of these local dimers appears to be associated with a metal-to-insulator transition with a nonmagnetic ground state, as also supported by density functional theory-based electronic structure calculations. This contribution demonstrates the power of soft chemistry to kinetically stabilize a simple binary oxide compound.

AB The transfer of two H-atom equivalents to the titanium-doped polyoxovanadate-alkoxide, [TiV5O6(OCH3)(13)], results in the formation of a V-(III)-OH2 site at the surface of the assembly. Incorporation of the group (IV) metal ion results in a weakening of the O-H bonds of [TiV5O5(OH2)-(OCH3)(13)] in comparison to its homometallic congener, [V6O6(OH2)-(OCH3)(12)], resembling more closely the thermodynamics reported for the one-electron reduced derivative, [V6O6(OH2)-(OCH3)(12)](1-). An analysis of early time points of the reaction of [TiV5O6(OCH3)(13)] and 5,10-dihydrophenazine reveals the formation of an oxidized substrate, suggesting that proton-coupled electron transfer proceeds via initial electron transfer from substrate to cluster prior to proton transfer. These results demonstrate the profound influence of heterometal dopants on the mechanism of PCET with respect to the surface of the assembly.

AB The Stober method for forming spherical silica colloids is well-established as one of the pillars of colloidal synthesis. In a modified form, it has been extensively used to deposit both porous and protective shells over metal nanomaterials. Current best-practice techniques require that the vitreophobic surface of metal nanoparticles be primed with a surface ligand to promote silica deposition. Although such techniques have proved highly successful in forming core-shell configurations, the site-selective deposition of silica onto preselected areas of faceted metal nanostructures has proved far more challenging. Herein, a primer-free TEOS-based synthesis is demonstrated that is capable of forming architecturally complex nanoframes and nanocages on the pristine surfaces of faceted gold nanostructures. The devised synthesis overcomes vitreophobicity using elevated TEOS concentrations that trigger silica nucleation along the low-coordination sites where gold facets meet. Continued deposition sees the emergence of a well-connected frame followed by the lateral infilling of the openings formed over gold facets. With growth readily terminated at any point in this sequence, the synthesis distinguishes itself in being able to achieve patterned and tunable silica depositions expressing interfaces that are uncorrupted by primers. The so-formed structures are demonstrated as template materials capable of asserting high-level control over synthesis and assembly processes by using the deposited silica as a mask that deactivates selected areas against these processes while allowing them to proceed elsewhere. The work, hence, extends the capabilities and versatility of TEOS-based syntheses and provides pathways for forming multicomponent nanostructures and nanoassemblies with structurally engineered properties.

AB Supercritical Impregnation methods are becoming popular in the development of food packaging materials. Bulk functional improvements of cellulose substrates using this method may be influenced by interfacial interactions between the impregnated solutes and cellulose. Hence, an interfacial adsorption kinetics study of solute molecules onto the substrate can provide insight on bulk property development, leading to an optimized packaging material with improved functionality. Paper substrates were impregnated with two food-grade waxes: Alkyl Ketene Dimer (AKD) and Carnauba Wax (CW). Hydrophobic development was monitored over a 3-week period. A quartz crystal microbalance (QCM-D) was used to determine interfacial characteristics and behavior of each wax with cellulose, and adsorption kinetics were quantified to compare the mass transfer processes of each wax at the interface. AKD significantly contributed to the substrate's hydrophobic development over time. CW generated mildly hydrophobic substrates only when heated. AKD strongly adhered to the cellulose fibers at the interface, and demonstrated a 3-stage kinetic adsorption process, tentatively assigned (i) diffusion through the solvent; (ii) diffusion through the substrate; and (iii) attachment onto the fibers. CW readily washed off the cellulose surface, demonstrating only the first adsorption process. The different chemical structures also impacted these behaviors, as did concentration and temperature.

AB Magnetism of molecular quantum materials such as single-molecule magnets (SMMs) has been actively studied for potential applications in the new generation of high-density data storage using SMMs and quantum information science. Magnetic anisotropy and spin-phonon coupling are two key properties of d- and f-metal complexes. Here, phonons refer to both intermolecular and intramolecular vibrations. Direct determination of magnetic anisotropy and experimental studies of spin-phonon coupling are critical to the understanding of molecular magnetism. This article discusses our recent approach in using three complementary techniques, far-IR and Raman magneto-spectroscopies (FIRMS and RaMS, respectively) and inelastic neutron scatterings (INS), to determine magnetic excited states. Spin-phonon couplings are observed in FIRMS and RaMS. DFT phonon calculations give energies and symmetries of phonons as well as calculated INS spectra which help identify magnetic peaks in experimental INS spectra.
   Magnetic anisotropy and spin-phonon coupling are key properties of single-molecule magnets. The use of far-IR and Raman magneto-spectroscopies (FIRMS and RaMS), and inelastic neutron scattering (INS) to determine the magnetic properties is highlighted.

TI Coiled Coil Peptide Tiles (CCPTs): Expanding the Peptide Building Block

AB Owing to their synthetic accessibility and protein-mimetic features, peptides represent an attractive biomolecular building block for the fabrication of artificial biomimetic materials with emergent properties and functions. Here, we expand the peptide building block design space through unveiling the design, synthesis, and characterization of novel, multivalent peptide macrocycles (96mers), termed coiled coil peptide tiles (CCPTs). CCPTs comprise multiple orthogonal coiled coil peptide domains that are separated by flexible linkers. The constraints, imposed by cyclization, confer CCPTs with the ability to direct programmable, multidirectional interactions between coiled coil-forming "edge" domains of CCPTs and their free peptide binding partners. These fully synthetic constructs are assembled using a convergent synthetic strategy via a combination of native chemical ligation and Sortase A-mediated cyclization. Circular dichroism (CD) studies reveal the increased helical stability associated with cyclization and subsequent coiled coil formation along the CCPT edges. Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), analytical high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and fluorescence quenching assays provide a comprehensive biophysical characterization of various assembled CCPT complexes and confirm the orthogonal colocalization between coiled coil domains within CCPTs and their designed on-target free peptide partners. Lastly, we employ molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which provide molecular-level insights into experimental results, as a supporting method for understanding the structural dynamics of CCPTs and their complexes. MD analysis of the simulated CCPT architectures reveals the rigidification and expansion of CCPTs upon complexation, i.e., coiled coil formation with their designed binding partners, and provides insights for guiding the designs of future generations of CCPTs. The addition of CCPTs into the repertoire of coiled coil-based building blocks has the potential for expanding the coiled coil assembly landscape by unlocking new topologies having designable intermolecular interfaces.

AB Osteoporosis is a common bone and metabolic disease that is characterized by bone density loss and microstructural degeneration. Human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are multipotent progenitor cells with the potential to differentiate into various cell types, including osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and adipocytes, which have been utilized extensively in the field of bone tissue engineering and cell-based therapy. Although fluid shear stress plays an important role in bone osteogenic differentiation, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this effect remain poorly understood. Here, a locked nucleic acid (LNA)/DNA nanobiosensor was exploited to monitor mRNA gene expression of hMSCs that were exposed to physiologically relevant fluid shear stress to examine the regulatory role of Notch signaling during osteogenic differentiation. First, the effects of fluid shear stress on cell viability, proliferation, morphology, and osteogenic differentiation were investigated and compared. Our results showed shear stress modulates hMSCs morphology and osteogenic differentiation depending on the applied shear and duration. By incorporating this LNA/DNA nanobiosensor and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining, we further investigated the role of Notch signaling in regulating osteogenic differentiation. Pharmacological treatment is applied to disrupt Notch signaling to investigate the mechanisms that govern shear stress induced osteogenic differentiation. Our experimental results provide convincing evidence supporting that physiologically relevant shear stress regulates osteogenic differentiation through Notch signaling. Inhibition of Notch signaling mediates the effects of shear stress on osteogenic differentiation, with reduced ALP enzyme activity and decreased Dll4 mRNA expression. In conclusion, our results will add new information concerning osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs under shear stress and the regulatory role of Notch signaling. Further studies may elucidate the mechanisms underlying the mechanosensitive role of Notch signaling in stem cell differentiation.

AB Polar sea ice is a critical component of Earth's climate system. As a material, it is a multiscale composite of pure ice with temperature-dependent millimeter-scale brine inclusions, and centimeter-scale polycrystalline microstructure which is largely determined by how the ice was formed. The surface layer of the polar oceans can be viewed as a granular composite of ice floes in a sea water host, with floe sizes ranging from centimeters to tens of kilometers. A principal challenge in modeling sea ice and its role in climate is how to use information on smaller-scale structures to find the effective or homogenized properties on larger scales relevant to process studies and coarse-grained climate models. That is, how do you predict macroscopic behavior from microscopic laws, like in statistical mechanics and solid state physics? Also of great interest in climate science is the inverse problem of recovering parameters controlling small-scale processes from large-scale observations. Motivated by sea ice remote sensing, the analytic continuation method for obtaining rigorous bounds on the homogenized coefficients of two-phase composites was applied to the complex permittivity of sea ice, which is a Stieltjes function of the ratio of the permittivities of ice and brine. Integral representations for the effective parameters distill the complexities of the composite microgeometry into the spectral properties of a self-adjoint operator like the Hamiltonian in quantum physics. These techniques have been extended to polycrystalline materials, advection diffusion processes, and ocean waves in the sea ice cover. Here we discuss this powerful approach in homogenization, highlighting the spectral representations and resolvent structure of the fields that are shared by the two-component theory and its extensions. Spectral analysis of sea ice structures leads to a random matrix theory picture of percolation processes in composites, establishing parallels to Anderson localization and semiconductor physics and providing new insights into the physics of sea ice.

AB Will climate change affect how armed actors behave toward civilians? Scholars analyzed different links between environmental variability and war, but research on links between the former and violence against civilians is very limited. Focusing on the Sahara Desert transition zone, which stretches across the entire African continent, we argue that climate harshness raises the willingness of actors to engage in competitive violence over resources. An underlying condition is this violence happens in times of greater environmental security, which provides opportunity for actors to engage in violence. We test this argument using statistical analysis of a newly released climate-conflict geospatial dataset and find support for this theoretical expectation. The conclusion outlines both research and policy implications.

Sin embargo, la investigaci & oacute;n en materia de los v & iacute;nculos entre la variabilidad ambiental y la violencia contra los civiles es muy limitada. Nos centramos en la zona de transici & oacute;n del desierto del S & aacute;hara, que se extiende por todo el continente africano, para argumentar que la dureza del clima aumenta la voluntad de los agentes con relaci & oacute;n a participar en la violencia competitiva por los recursos. Una de las condiciones subyacentes consiste en que esta violencia ocurre en tiempos de mayor seguridad ambiental, lo que brinda oportunidades para que los agentes participen en la violencia. Probamos esta hip & oacute;tesis mediante el an & aacute;lisis estad & iacute;stico de un conjunto de datos geoespaciales de conflictos clim & aacute;ticos, el cual ha sido recientemente publicado, y que nos proporciona apoyo para esta expectativa te & oacute;rica.

AB A computational approach is presented for optimizing new riblet surface designs in turbulent channel flow for drag reduction, utilizing design-by-morphing (DbM), large Eddy simulation (LES), and Bayesian optimization (BO). The design space is generated using DbM to include a variety of novel riblet surface designs, which are then evaluated using LES to determine their drag-reducing capabilities. The riblet surface geometry and configuration are optimized for maximum drag reduction using the mixed-variable Bayesian optimization (MixMOBO) algorithm. A total of 125 optimization epochs are carried out, resulting in the identification of three optimal riblet surface designs that are comparable to or better than the reference drag reduction rate of 8%. The Bayesian-optimized designs commonly suggest riblet sizes of around 15 wall units, relatively large spacing compared to conventional designs, and spiky tips with notches for the riblets. Our overall optimization process is conducted within a reasonable physical time frame with up to 12-core parallel computing and can be practical for fluid engineering optimization problems that require high-fidelity computational design before materialization.

AB Taking a biomimetic approach, this study introduces the use of a Voronoi diagram as an indicator of stiffener arrangement in stiffened composite panels. The locations of generator points that determine the shape of the Voronoi diagram are optimized for buckling problems under compression and shear load. An original optimization algorithm that combines the genetic algorithm and the finite element method is developed and implemented. The Voronoi diagram can also be used as an indicator for conventional, periodical stiffener shapes such as grid, lattice, honeycomb, and isogrid. We conducted parametric studies for periodical stiffener shapes, and demonstrated that these shapes can be designed using Voronoi diagrams. The results revealed that the optimized panel has a higher buckling load than that of conventional panels, and this methodology is effective for designing biomimetic stiffened CFRP panel structures.

AB Polyacrylamide hydrogels are widely used in biomedical applications due to their tunable mechanical properties and charge neutrality. Our recent tribological investigations of polyacrylamide gels have revealed tunable and pH-dependent friction behavior. To determine the origins of this pH-responsiveness, we prepared polyacrylamide hydrogels with two different initiating chemistries: a reduction-oxidation (redox)-initiated system using ammonium persulfate (APS) and N,N,N & PRIME;N & PRIME;-tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED) and a UV-initiated system with 2-hydroxy-4 & PRIME;-(2-hydroxyethoxy)-2-methylpropiophenone (Irgacure 2959). Hydrogel swelling, mechanical properties, and tribological behavior were investigated in response to solution pH (ranging from & AP; 0.34 to 13.5). For polyacrylamide hydrogels in sliding contact with glass hemispherical probes, friction coefficients decreased from & mu; = 0.07 & PLUSMN; 0.02 to & mu; = 0.002 & PLUSMN; 0.002 (redox-initiated) and from & mu; = 0.05 & PLUSMN; 0.03 to & mu; = 0.003 & PLUSMN; 0.003 (UV-initiated) with increasing solution pH. With hemispherical polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) probes, friction coefficients of redox-initiated hydrogels similarly decreased from & mu; = 0.06 & PLUSMN; 0.01 to & mu; = 0.002 & PLUSMN; 0.001 with increasing pH. Raman spectroscopy measurements demonstrated hydrolysis and the conversion of amide groups to carboxylic acid in basic conditions. We therefore propose that the mechanism for pH-responsive friction in polyacrylamide hydrogels may be credited to hydrolysis-driven swelling through the conversion of side chain amide groups into carboxylic groups and/or crosslinker degradation. Our results could assist in the rational design of hydrogel-based tribological pairs for biomedical applications from acidic to alkaline conditions.

   printability
ID BEHAVIOR
AB Direct ink writing (DIW) using polymer-particle composite inks is a new research area enabling a wide range of new functionalities. Despite extensive studies, there remains a need for a deeper understanding of how particle size and loading specifically influence printability, especially in the nano range. This work aims to systematically evaluate the effects of SiO2 nanoparticle size (26-847 nm) and loading on printability within a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) matrix. For the single-layer printing process, which is influenced by the substrate properties, a 3D printing line analysis (3D-PLA) is developed to monitor the top and side views of printed lines. It is found that line width varies with ink composition and substrate, while the line height decreases with solvent evaporation, indicating a strong confinement effect from the substrate. For multilayer structures, dual-layer printing analysis (DLPA) is utilized to evaluate the printability. It is shown that DLPA is independent of the substrate and can be used to compare the printabilities from different inks. Both 3D-PLA and DLPA can be correlated to the rheological behavior of the ink through ink rheology analysis (IRA). Finally, this research defined the design space for DIW by benchmarking the minimum and maximum particle loadings for printable composite inks.

AB Modeling interacting dynamical systems, such as fluid dynamics and intermolecular interactions, is a fundamental research problem for understanding and simulating complex real-world systems. Many of these systems can be naturally represented by dynamic graphs, and graph neural network-based approaches have been proposed and shown promising performance. However, most of these approaches assume the underlying dynamics does not change over time, which is unfortunately untrue. For example, a molecular dynamics can be affected by the environment temperature over the time. In this paper, we take an attempt to provide a probabilistic view for time-varying dynamics and propose a model Context-attended Graph ODE (CARE) for modeling time-varying interacting dynamical systems. In our CARE, we explicitly use a context variable to model time-varying environment and construct an encoder to initialize the context variable from historical trajectories. Furthermore, we employ a neural ODE model to depict the dynamic evolution of the context variable inferred from system states. This context variable is incorporated into a coupled ODE to simultaneously drive the evolution of systems. Comprehensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed CARE compared with several state-of-the-art approaches.

AB Numerous methods have been developed to explain the inner mechanism of deep neural network (DNN) based classifiers. Existing explanation methods are often limited to explaining predictions of a pre-specified class, which answers the question "why is the input classified into this class?" However, such explanations with respect to a single class are inherently insufficient because they do not capture features with class-discriminative power. That is, features that are important for predicting one class may also be important for other classes. To capture features with true class-discriminative power, we should instead ask "why is the input classified into this class, but not others?" To answer this question, we propose a weighted contrastive framework for explaining DNNs. Our framework can easily convert any existing back-propagation explanation methods to build class-contrastive explanations. We theoretically validate our weighted contrast explanation in general back-propagation explanations, and show that our frame-work enables class-contrastive explanations with significant improvements in both qualitative and quantitative experiments. Based on the results, we point out an important blind spot in the current explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) study, where explanations towards the predicted logits and the probabilities are obfuscated. We suggest that these two aspects should be distinguished explicitly any time explanation methods are applied.

AB Particle collisions at the energy frontier can probe the nature of invisible dark matter via production in association with recoiling visible objects. We propose a new potential production mode, in which dark matter is produced by the decay of a heavy dark Higgs boson radiated from a heavy W ' boson. In such a model, motivated by left-right symmetric theories, dark matter would not be pair produced in association with other recoiling objects due to its lack of direct coupling to quarks or gluons. We study the hadronic decay mode via W ' -> tb and estimate the LHC exclusion sensitivity at 95% confidence level to be 10(2) - 10(5) fb for W ' boson masses between 250 and 1750 GeV.

ID HERBAL MEDICINE; IDENTIFICATION
AB Ginseng (Panax sp.) is a medicinal plant used for its purported health benefits, primarily in East Asian countries. The COVID-19 pandemic led to a significant increase in sales of dietary supplements, including ginseng supplements, to purportedly support immune health and provide other health benefits. However, this heightened demand has subsequently increased the risk of adulteration in these dietary supplements. This study aimed to determine the efficacy of a novel combination of DNA barcoding and multiplex PCR to identify species in ginseng supplements. A total of 50 commercial ginseng supplements containing Panax ginseng, Panax quinquefolius, or Panax notoginseng were obtained from an online vendor. Two composite samples per product were subjected to DNA extraction followed by multiplex PCR and DNA barcoding with three genetic targets (i.e., rbcL, matK, and ITS2). Of the three DNA barcoding markers, ITS2 had the highest amplification success at 74%, and matK had the highest sequencing success at 60%. DNA barcoding alone identified species in 68% of products, while multiplex PCR had an overall 60% identification rate. The combination of both methods resulted in a 72% species identification rate. In addition to improving the overall identification rate, the combination of both methods allowed for greater species resolution and the detection of undeclared plant species. Future research should explore combining DNA-based methods with chemical-based approaches to improve ginseng detection capabilities and enable the quantification of undeclared adulterants.

AB During summer 2010, exceptional heat and drought in western Russia (WRU) occurred simultaneously with heavy rainfall and flooding in northern Pakistan (NPK). Here, we use the Great Eurasian Drought Atlas (GEDA), a new 1021-yr tree-ring reconstruction of summer soil moisture, to investigate the variability and dynamics of this exceptional spatially concurrent climate extreme over the last millennium. Summer 2010 in the GEDA was the second driest year over WRU and the largest wet-dry contrast between NPK and WRU; it was also the second warmest year over WRU in an independent 1015-yr temperature reconstruction. Soil moisture variability is only weakly correlated between the two regions, and 2010 event analogs are rare, occurring in 31 (3.0%) or 52 (5.1%) years in the GEDA, depending on the definition used. Post-1900 is significantly drier in WRU and wetter in NPK compared to previous centuries, increasing the likelihood of concurrent wet NPK-dry WRU extremes, with over 20% of the events in the record occurring in this interval. The dynamics of wet NPK-dry WRU events like 2010 are well captured by two principal components in the GEDA, modes correlated with ridging over northern Europe and western Russia and a pan-hemispheric extratropical wave train pattern similar to that observed in 2010. Our results highlight how high-resolution paleoclimate reconstructions can be used to capture some of the most extreme events in the climate system, investigate their physical drivers, and allow us to assess their behavior across longer time scales than available from shorter instrumental records.

AB 'Scale the model, scale the data, scale the GPU farms' is the reigning sentiment in the world of generative AI today. While model scaling has been extensively studied, data scaling and its downstream impacts on model performance remain under-explored. This is particularly important in the context of multimodal datasets whose main source is the World WideWeb, condensed and packaged as the Common Crawl dump, which is known to exhibit numerous drawbacks. In this paper, we evaluate the downstream impact of dataset scaling on 14 visio-linguistic models (VLMs) trained on the LAION400-M and LAION-2B datasets by measuring racial and gender bias using the Chicago Face Dataset (CFD) as the probe. Our results show that as the training data increased, the probability of a pre-trained CLIP model misclassifying human images as offensive non-human classes such as chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan decreased, but misclassifying the same images as human offensive classes such as criminal increased. Furthermore, of the 14 Vision Transformer-based VLMs we evaluated, the probability of predicting an image of a Black man and a Latino man as criminal increases by 65% and 69%, respectively, when the dataset is scaled from 400M to 2B samples for the larger ViT-L models. Conversely, for the smaller base ViT-B models, the probability of predicting an image of a Black man and a Latino man as criminal decreases by 20% and 47%, respectively, when the dataset is scaled from 400M to 2B samples. We ground the model audit results in a qualitative and historical analysis, reflect on our findings and their implications for dataset curation practice, and close with a summary of mitigation mechanisms and ways forward.

ID DATABASE; DOCKING; DRIVEN
AB Author summaryMany complex diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, mental disorders, and substance use disorders, do not have safe and effective therapeutics because of the polygenic nature of the diseases and a lack of thoroughly validated drug targets (and their corresponding ligands). Identifying small-molecule ligands for all proteins encoded in the human genome would provide powerful new opportunities for drug discovery of currently untreatable diseases. However, the small-molecule ligand of more than 90% of gene families is completely unknown. Existing protein-ligand docking and machine learning methods often fail when the protein of interest is dissimilar to those with known functions or structures. We have developed a new deep learning framework, PortalCG, for efficiently and accurately predicting ligands of understudied proteins which are out of reach of existing methods. Our method achieves unprecedented accuracy versus state-of-the-art approaches, and it achieves this by incorporating ligand binding site information and the sequence-to-structure-to-function paradigm into a novel deep meta-learning algorithm. In a case study, the performance of PortalCG surpassed the rational design from medicinal chemists. The proposed computational framework can shed new light on how chemicals modulate biological systems, which is indispensable in drug repurposing and rational design of polypharmacology. This approach could offer a new way to develop safe and effective therapeutics for currently incurable diseases. PortalCG can be extended to other types of tasks, such as predicting protein-protein interactions and protein-nucleic acid recognition.
   Systematically discovering protein-ligand interactions across the entire human and pathogen genomes is critical in chemical genomics, protein function prediction, drug discovery, and many other areas. However, more than 90% of gene families remain "dark"-i.e., their small-molecule ligands are undiscovered due to experimental limitations or human/historical biases. Existing computational approaches typically fail when the dark protein differs from those with known ligands. To address this challenge, we have developed a deep learning framework, called PortalCG, which consists of four novel components:(i) a 3-dimensional ligand binding site enhanced sequence pre-training strategy to encode the evolutionary links between ligand-binding sites across gene families; (ii) an end-to-end pretraining-fine-tuning strategy to reduce the impact of inaccuracy of predicted structures on function predictions by recognizing the sequence-structure-function paradigm; (iii) a new out-of-cluster meta-learning algorithm that extracts and accumulates information learned from predicting ligands of distinct gene families (meta-data) and applies the meta-data to a dark gene family; and (iv) a stress model selection step, using different gene families in the test data from those in the training and development data sets to facilitate model deployment in a real-world scenario. In extensive and rigorous benchmark experiments, PortalCG considerably outperformed state-of-the-art techniques of machine learning and protein-ligand docking when applied to dark gene families, and demonstrated its generalization power for target identifications and compound screenings under out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Furthermore, in an external validation for the multi-target compound screening, the performance of PortalCG surpassed the rational design from medicinal chemists. Our results also suggest that a differentiable sequence-structure-function deep learning framework, where protein structural information serves as an intermediate layer, could be superior to conventional methodology where predicted protein structures were used for the compound screening. We applied PortalCG to two case studies to exemplify its potential in drug discovery: designing selective dual-antagonists of dopamine receptors for the treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD), and illuminating the understudied human genome for target diseases that do not yet have effective and safe therapeutics. Our results suggested that PortalCG is a viable solution to the OOD problem in exploring understudied regions of protein functional space.

AB The spread and resurgence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (COVID-19 disease) threatens human health and social relations. Prevention of COVID-19 disease partly relies on fabricating low-cost, point-of-care (POC) sensing technology that can rapidly and selectively detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We report a colorimetric, paper-based polydiacetylene (PDA) biosensor, designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in artificial saliva. Analytical characterizations of the PDA sensor using NMR and FT-IR spectroscopy showed the correct structural elucidation of PCDA-NHS conjugation. The PDA sensor platform containing the N-Hydroxysuccinimide ester of 10, 12-pentacosadiynoic acid (PCDA-NHS) was divided into three experimental PCDA-NHS concentration groups of 10%, 20%, and 30% to optimize the performance of the sensor. The optimal PCDA-NHS molar concentration was determined to be 10%. The PDA sensor works by a color change from blue to red as its colorimetric output when the immobilized antibody binds to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in saliva samples. Our results showed that the PDA sensing platform was able to rapidly and qualitatively detect the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein within the concentration range of 1 to 100 ng/mL after four hours of incubation. Further investigation of pH and temperature showed minimal influence on the PDA sensor for the detection of COVID-19 disease. After exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, smartphone images of the PDA sensor were used to assess the sensor output by using the red chromatic shift (RCS) of the signal response. These results indicate the potential and practical use of this PDA sensor design for the rapid, colorimetric detection of COVID-19 disease in developing countries with limited access to medical testing.

AB Background: Few studies have connected nursing students' performance in simulations to clinical competencies exemplified in The Essentials and the NCJMM. This retrospective study examined the effectiveness of screen-based virtual patient simulations (VPS) in facilitating ten undergraduate prelicensure students' practice of clinical judgment, person-centered care, and professionalism. Methods: Multimodal transcripts capturing patient interactions, exam actions, and documentation in a gerontology and mental health scenario were analyzed using Transmodal Ordered Network Analysis (T/ONA). We examined the strength and order of connections students made to recognizing cues, analyzing cues, diagnosing and prioritizing hypotheses, generating solutions, evaluating outcomes, subjective assessment, therapeutic communication, and care-management and coordination. Findings: Both scenarios afforded opportunities for students to gather comprehensive data and make evidence-based and patient-centered care decisions. However, students' patterns of connection making were significantly different for virtual patients who presented palliative care versus mental health care needs. Conclusion: The assurance for nursing students' practice readiness can be realized through careful implementation of diverse assignment types and scenarios in VPS. T/ONA provides a novel and systematic approach for studying student behaviors in simulations.

AB Non-spherical nanostructures such as multilayered polygons and branched Au nanoparticles demonstrate high Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) performance due to their plasmonic nature and anisotropic morphology. Unfortunately, their syntheses often involve multiple steps and complex reagents. In particular, a conventional synthesis of Au nanoplatelets (AuNPt) involves a toxic cationic surfactant that should be substituted with more ecologically friendly reagents. Herein, we demonstrate the synthesis of AuNPt utilizing organic biomolecules from the plant Cercis Canadensis. These SERS-capable AuNPt are also shown to undergo a distinctive structural modification through plasma-dependent etching of the nanoparticle. This etching allows, in high yield, the {111} facets to develop surface undulations and perforations through the entire structure that increases anisotropy. The AuNPt are demonstrated to be surfactant-free through the absence of hydrocarbons in the IR spectra and EDX measurements. The nanoplatelets displayed a 17.142 +/- 1.193 x Raman to SERS peak enhancement, 4133% increase of the area under the curve, and a 1580% increase in the FWHM in the fingerprint 1341 cm-1 peak of p-nitrothiophenol. Measurements were done in liquid- and solid-phase to demonstrate the versatility of the AuNPts.

TI Noise reduction of stochastic density functional theory for metals
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
LA English
DT Article
ID ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE; MATRIX; NANOPARTICLES; CATALYSIS; SYSTEMS
AB Density Functional Theory (DFT) has become a cornerstone in the modeling of metals. However, accurately simulating metals, particularly under extreme conditions, presents two significant challenges. First, simulating complex metallic systems at low electron temperatures is difficult due to their highly delocalized density matrix. Second, modeling metallic warm-dense materials at very high electron temperatures is challenging because it requires the computation of a large number of partially occupied orbitals. This study demonstrates that both challenges can be effectively addressed using the latest advances in linear-scaling stochastic DFT methodologies. Despite the inherent introduction of noise into all computed properties by stochastic DFT, this research evaluates the efficacy of various noise reduction techniques under different thermal conditions. Our observations indicate that the effectiveness of noise reduction strategies varies significantly with the electron temperature. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the computational cost of stochastic DFT methods scales linearly with system size for metal systems, regardless of the electron temperature regime.

AB Visual control enables quadrotors to adaptively navigate using real-time sensory data, bridging perception with action. Yet, challenges persist, including generalization across scenarios, maintaining reliability, and ensuring real-time responsiveness. This paper introduces a perception framework grounded in foundation models for universal object detection and tracking, moving beyond specific training categories. Integral to our approach is a multi-layered tracker integrated with the foundation detector, ensuring continuous target visibility, even when faced with motion blur, abrupt light shifts, and occlusions. Complementing this, we introduce a model-free controller tailored for resilient quadrotor visual tracking. Our system operates efficiently on limited hardware, relying solely on an onboard camera and an inertial measurement unit. Through extensive validation in diverse challenging indoor and outdoor environments, we demonstrate our system's effectiveness and adaptability. In conclusion, our research represents a step forward in quadrotor visual tracking, moving from task-specific methods to more versatile and adaptable operations.

AB Autonomous identification and evaluation of safe landing zones are of paramount importance for ensuring the safety and effectiveness of aerial robots in the event of system failures, low battery, or the successful completion of specific tasks. In this paper, we present a novel approach for detection and assessment of potential landing sites for safe quadrotor landing. Our solution efficiently integrates 2D and 3D environmental information, eliminating the need for external aids such as GPS and computationally intensive elevation maps. The proposed pipeline combines semantic data derived from a Neural Network (NN), to extract environmental features, with geometric data obtained from a disparity map, to extract critical geometric attributes such as slope, flatness, and roughness. We define several cost metrics based on these attributes to evaluate safety, stability, and suitability of regions in the environments and identify the most suitable landing area. Our approach runs in real-time on quadrotors equipped with limited computational capabilities. Experimental results conducted in diverse environments demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively assess and identify suitable landing areas, enabling the safe and autonomous landing of a quadrotor.

AB Renewable energy sources such as solar and wind produce electricity intermittently, creating challenges in balancing electricity supply and demand for increasingly renewable-dominated grids. This is driving efforts to increase energy storage infrastructure, such as pumped hydroelectric power storage (pumped storage). In this research, we examine environmental justice issues in a case study of a proposed pumped storage facility in Goldendale, Washington, which has been highly controversial and actively contested by a coalition of Indigenous and environmental communities. Drawing from frameworks of political ecology, just transitions, and Indigenous environmental justice, we focus on processes of consultation and engagement around permitting as a key arena for environmental justice contestation, and critically examine the driving assumptions behind the project. Despite popular framings of renewable energy infrastructures as new and green, we argue that the environmental justice impacts of this and similar projects represent continuity with past patterns of settler colonialism and extractive development.

Indeed, rising temperatures have already contributed to large-scale plant mortality events across the globe. These impacts may be especially severe in cities, where the urban heat island effect amplifies climate warming. Understanding how plant species will respond physiologically to rising temperatures and how these responses differ among plant functional groups is critical for predicting future biodiversity scenarios and making informed land management decisions. In this study, we evaluated the effects of elevated temperatures on a functionally and taxonomically diverse group of woody native plant species in a restored urban nature preserve in southern California using measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence as an indicator of leaf thermotolerance. Our aim was to determine if species' traits and drought strategies could serve as useful predictors of thermotolerance. We found that leaf thermotolerance differed among species with contrasting drought strategies, and several leaf-level functional traits were significant predictors of thermotolerance thresholds. Drought deciduous species with high specific leaf area, high rates of transpiration and low water use efficiency were the most susceptible to heat damage, while evergreen species with sclerophyllous leaves, high relative water content and high water use efficiency maintained photosynthetic function at higher temperatures. While these native shrubs and trees are physiologically equipped to withstand relatively high temperatures in this Mediterranean-type climate, hotter conditions imposed by climate change and urbanization may exceed the tolerance thresholds of many species. We show that leaf functional traits and plant drought strategies may serve as useful indicators of species' vulnerabilities to climate change, and this information can be used to guide restoration and conservation in a warmer world.

AB Most natural granular deposits are spatially variable due to heterogeneities in soil hydraulic conductivity, layer thickness, relative density, and continuity. However, existing simplified liquefaction evaluation procedures treat each susceptible layer as homogeneous and in isolation, neglecting water flow patterns and displacement mechanisms that result from interactions among soil layers, the groundwater table, foundation, and structure. In this paper, three-dimensional, fully coupled, nonlinear, dynamic finite-element analyses, validated with centrifuge experimental results, are used to evaluate the influence of stratigraphic layering, depth to the groundwater table, and foundation-structure properties on system performance. The ejecta potential index (EPI) serves as a proxy for surface ejecta severity within each soil profile. The results reveal that among all the engineering demand parameters (EDPs) and geotechnical liquefaction indices considered, only EPI predicted a substantial change in the surface manifestation of liquefaction due to changes in the location of the groundwater table and soil stratigraphy. This trend better follows the patterns from case history observations, indicating the value of EPI. Profiles with multiple critical liquefiable layers at greater depths resulted in base isolation and reduced permanent foundation settlement. Ground motion characteristics have the highest influence on EDPs, among the properties considered. The outcropping rock motion intensity measures with the best combination of efficiency, sufficiency, and predictability were identified as cumulative absolute velocity (for predicting foundation's permanent settlement and free-field EPI) and peak ground velocity (for peak excess porepressure ratio). These results underscore the importance of careful field characterization of stratigraphic layering in relation to the foundation and structural properties to evaluate the potential liquefaction deformation and damage mechanisms. The results also indicate that incorporating EPI alongside traditional EDPs shows promise.

AB The affinity difference between lithium and potassium ions for the adsorption to a titanosilicate adsorbent is quantified. Experimental and computational methods examine the thermodynamics of Na+-K+ and Na+-Li+ ion exchange from dilute aqueous solution using modified ETS-10 titanosilicate. Equilibrium uptake data were analyzed with a modified Langmuir isotherm that accounts for ion exchange involving the desorption of Na+ from the modified ETS-10 framework together with the adsorption of Li+ or K+ to the framework. The equilibrium constant for ion exchange of Na+ from the modified ETS-10 framework with K+ from aqueous solution is 6-fold greater than the equilibrium constant for Li+ exchange. This affinity difference is supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations of ion affinity to the modified ETS-10 framework. Energy differences from DFT were interpreted using a thermochemical cycle to account for hydration and solvation of cations, thus enabling comparison between the experiment and theory. DFT-derived energy differences also revealed the binding affinity differences of the various sites of ETS-10 among Li+, Na+, and K+.

AB Quantum computing is commonly considered one highly efficient computing method with the potential to revolutionize computation technology and solve problems that are currently unsolvable. However, due to the limitation of hardware equipment and an immature experimental base, quantum technology is still in its early stages and is far from achieving the expected performance, especially in solving large-scale complex problems. To break through these barriers, we propose a parallelized quantum annealing algorithm based on Lagrangian relaxation. The proposed algorithm divides the large-scale problem into several small problems and then employs multiple quantum computers to solve them. Our proposed approach overcomes the limited number of qubits and allows quantum computing to solve largescale optimization problems. Additionally, we incorporate a local search method to ensure this Lagrangian relaxation based quantum algorithm achieves an optimal solution. We use the proposed parallelized quantum annealing algorithm to solve optimal scheduling problems in network function virtualization networks. The problem is expressed in a linear optimization model that is NP-hard. Our proposed algorithm presents excellent time performance in solving this virtualized network functions scheduling problem, compared with the Lagrangian relaxation based classical algorithm.

ID SEA-LEVEL RISE; INFILTRATION
AB The variation of the coastal groundwater table and the vulnerability of sanitary sewer infrastructure under a changing climate is considered for Imperial Beach (CA, USA) by incorporating the compound impacts of SeaLevel Rise (SLR), groundwater shoaling, and precipitation intensification. For 2 m of SLR, marine inundation is expected to impact only 2% of the urbanized area; however, SLR-driven groundwater shoaling is projected to impact 36% of the subterranean sewer system. Due to GroundWater Infiltration (GWI) and Rainfall-Derived Inflow and Infiltration (RDII), the sanitary sewage flow increases by 21% and 49% during dry- (i.e., consecutive days without precipitation) and wet-weather conditions (i.e., 24-hour rainfall with a 25-year return period), respectively. At SLR = 2 m, defect flows (GWI + RDII) can be elevated by 84% and 120% in dry- and wet-weather conditions, respectively. Such elevated hydraulic loads may place $0.5-$2.7 M additional cost on the collection system and treatment facilities every year. Moreover, pressurized junctions due to the above-mentioned hydraulic loading are likely to expose the community and the environment to raw sewage pollution. By involving structural, hydrological, and hydraulic criteria, a holistic approach is presented and implemented for prioritizing sewer system rehabilitation.

AB Aleutianamine is a recently isolated pyrroloiminoquinone natural product that displays potent and selective biological activity toward human pancreatic cancer cells with an IC50 of 25 nM against PANC-1, making it a potential candidate for therapeutic development. We report a synthetic approach to aleutianamine wherein the unique [3.3.1] ring system and tertiary sulfide of this alkaloid were constructed via a novel palladium-catalyzed dearomative thiophene functionalization. Other highlights of the synthesis include a palladium-catalyzed decarboxylative pinacol-type rearrangement of an allylic carbonate to install a ketone and a late-stage oxidative amination. This concise and convergent strategy will enable access to analogues of aleutianamine and further investigation of the biological activity of this unique natural product.

AB During the 17 March 2015 geomagnetic storm, citizen scientist observations from Dunedin (45.95 degrees S, 170.32 degrees E), New Zealand, revealed a bright wide red arc known as stable auroral red (SAR) arc evolving into a thin white-mauve arc, known as Strong Thermal Emission Velocity Enhancement (STEVE). An all-sky imager at the Mount John Observatory (43.99 degrees S, 170.46 degrees E), 200 km north of Dunedin, detected an extremely bright arc in 630.0 nm, with a peak of similar to 6 kR, colocated with the arc measured at Dunedin at an assumed height of 425 km. Swarm satellite data measured plasma parameters that showed strong subauroral ion drift signatures when the SAR arc was observed. These conditions intensified to extremely high values in a thinner channel when STEVE was present. Our results highlight the fast evolution of plasma properties and their effects on optical emissions. Current theories and models are unable to reproduce or explain these observations.

TI Variational Quantum Algorithm for Non-Markovian Quantum Dynamics Using
   an Ensemble of Ehrenfest Trajectories
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
AB The simulation of non-Markovian quantum dynamics plays an important role in the understanding of charge and exciton dynamics in the condensed phase environment, yet such a simulation remains computationally expensive on classical computers. In this work, we develop a variational quantum algorithm that is capable of simulating non-Markovian quantum dynamics on quantum computers. The algorithm captures the non-Markovian effect by employing the Ehrenfest trajectories and Monte Carlo sampling of their thermal distribution. We test the algorithm with the spin-boson model on the quantum simulator, and the results match quantitatively with the exact ones. The algorithm naturally fits into the parallel computing platform of the NISQ devices and can be extended to anharmonic system-bath interactions and multistate systems.

TI Minimizing Edge Caching Service Costs Through Regret-Optimal Online
   Learning
SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORKING
LA English
DT Article
DE Edge caching; online learning
ID ALLOCATION; MULTICAST
AB Edge caching has been widely implemented to efficiently serve data requests from end users. Numerous edge caching policies have been proposed to adaptively update the cache contents based on various statistics. One critical statistic is the miss cost, which could measure the latency or the bandwidth/energy consumption to resolve the cache miss. Existing caching policies typically assume that the miss cost for each data item is fixed and known. However, in real systems, they could be random with unknown statistics. A promising approach would be to use online learning to estimate the unknown statistics of these random costs, and make caching decisions adaptively. Unfortunately, conventional learning techniques cannot be directly applied, because the caching problem has additional cache capacity and cache update constraints that are not covered in traditional learning settings. In this work, we resolve these issues by developing a novel edge caching policy that learns uncertain miss costs efficiently, and is shown to be asymptotically optimal. We first derive an asymptotic lower bound on the achievable regret. We then design a Kullback-Leibler lower confidence bound (KL-LCB) based edge caching policy, which adaptively learns the random miss costs by following the "optimism in the face of uncertainty" principle. By employing a novel analysis that accounts for the new constraints and the dynamics of the setting, we prove that the regret of the proposed policy matches the regret lower bound, thus showing asymptotic optimality. Further, via numerical experiments we demonstrate the performance improvements of our policy over natural benchmarks.

AB Context. Low-mass stars appear to frequently host planetary systems. When these rocky planets develop high eccentricities as a result of secular torques or dynamical scatterings, they occasionally pass close to the host star. In these close passages, the planets can be tidally disrupted, and sheared into bound and unbound debris tails. To suffer such a disruption, the stellar density must be higher than the planetary density.
   Aims. This condition is met for the most common star and planet systems, M dwarf stars hosting rocky planets. We describe the dynamics of a tidal disruption, and estimate the typical velocities of unbound ejecta.
   Methods. We simulate the gas dynamics of a planetary tidal disruption, and show that disruptions preserve the layered structure of a rocky body, with the outermost layers flung into interstellar space with the highest velocities.
   Results. We compare these properties to those of the candidate interstellar meteoroid CNEOS-2014-01-08 (IM1). IM1's approximately 60 km s(-1) excess speed relative to the local standard of rest is naturally reproduced by the unbound debris of the disruption of an Earth-like planet around an M dwarf star. We suggest that such an encounter might explain the interstellar kinematics of IM1, and its unusual composition, especially if it originated in the fastest-expelled crust of a differentiated rocky planet. Finally, we estimate that the disruption of similar to 10 M-circle plus reservoirs of rocky planets per M dwarf are needed to reproduce the inferred rate of IM1-like objects.

AB Trust is an important factor in people's interactions with AI systems. However, there is a lack of empirical studies examining how real end-users trust or distrust the AI system they interact with. Most research investigates one aspect of trust in lab settings with hypothetical end-users. In this paper, we provide a holistic and nuanced understanding of trust in AI through a qualitative case study of a real-world computer vision application. We report findings from interviews with 20 end-users of a popular, AI-based bird identification app where we inquired about their trust in the app from many angles. We find participants perceived the app as trustworthy and trusted it, but selectively accepted app outputs after engaging in verification behaviors, and decided against app adoption in certain high-stakes scenarios. We also find domain knowledge and context are important factors for trust-related assessment and decision-making. We discuss the implications of our findings and provide recommendations for future research on trust in AI.

AB Battery endurance represents a key challenge for long-term autonomy and long-range operations, especially in the case of aerial robots. In this paper, we propose AutoCharge, an autonomous charging solution for quadrotors that combines a portable ground station with a flexible, lightweight charging tether and is capable of universal, highly efficient, and robust charging. We design and manufacture a pair of circular magnetic connectors to ensure a precise orientation-agnostic electrical connection between the ground station and the charging tether. Moreover, we supply the ground station with an electromagnet that largely increases the tolerance to localization and control errors during the docking maneuver, while still guaranteeing smooth un-docking once the charging process is completed. We demonstrate AutoCharge on a perpetual 10 hours quadrotor flight experiment and show that the docking and un-docking performance is solidly repeatable, enabling perpetual quadrotor flight missions.

AB The McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDVs) of Antarctica are a mosaic of extreme habitats which are dominated by microbial life. The MDVs include glacial melt holes, streams, lakes, and soils, which are interconnected through the transfer of energy and flux of inorganic and organic material via wind and hydrology. For the first time, we provide new data on the viral community structure and function in the MDVs through metagenomics of the planktonic and benthic mat communities of Lakes Bonney and Fryxell. Viral taxonomic diversity was compared across lakes and ecological function was investigated by characterizing auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) and predicting viral hosts. Our data suggest that viral communities differed between the lakes and among sites: these differences were connected to microbial host communities. AMGs were associated with the potential augmentation of multiple biogeochemical processes in host, most notably with phosphorus acquisition, organic nitrogen acquisition, sulfur oxidation, and photosynthesis. Viral genome abundances containing AMGs differed between the lakes and microbial mats, indicating site specialization. Using procrustes analysis, we also identified significant coupling between viral and bacterial communities (p = 0.001). Finally, host predictions indicate viral host preference among the assembled viromes. Collectively, our data show that: (i) viruses are uniquely distributed through the McMurdo Dry Valley lakes, (ii) their AMGs can contribute to overcoming host nutrient limitation and, (iii) viral and bacterial MDV communities are tightly coupled.

AB Remote sensing of urban environments has unveiled a significant shift from single-city investigations to the inclusion of multiple cities. Originated from the ideas of the Remote Sensing of Environment special issue entitled "Remote Sensing of the Urban Environment: Beyond the Single City," this paper offers a comprehensive examination of the state of the science in multi-city remote sensing, and aims at fostering the rapid advancement of this emerging field to address global sustainability challenges and support knowledge development needed for a new discipline - urban sustainability science (USS). Through a synthesized review of eight key research fields within urban remote sensing [i.e., land use and land cover (LULC) and change, urban vertical structure, urban heat islands, hazards, energy use and emissions, air quality, carbon budgets, and green space], the paper provides insights into the underlying rationale for conducting multi-city studies, the criteria employed in the selection of cities, the societal applications, as well as the opportunities and future directions for expanding the scope of assessments in multi-city remote sensing.

AB Numerous optimization scenarios such as industrial production planning, network communication routing, and logistic scheduling can be modeled as large-scale integer linear programming problems. However, due to the NP-Hardness of these problems, it is very challenging to optimally solve these problems in a short time on classical computers. Quantum computers have emerged as a new computing platform to provide new computing paradigms to tackle these problems. However, the scalability and efficiency of current quantum computers pose significant challenges in practical implementations of quantum optimization algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid quantum-classical approach, termed Hybrid quantum-classical Dantzig-Wolfe Decomposition (HyDWD), aimed at solving these problems. In this framework, the subproblems can be solved in parallel on quantum computers. Our results demonstrate the benefits of integrating parallel quantum computing with the proposed hybrid quantum-classical framework via Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition, paving the way for advancements in optimization and decision-making processes.

AB Microstructure control of in situ metal matrix nanocomposites (MMNCs) poses a barrier to their large-scale production. Here, we interrogate in unprecedented detail the formation mechanisms, morphologies, and microstructures of an in situ Al/TiC MMNC processed via salt flux reaction. Through synchrotron-based Xray nanotomography (TXM) and scanning and transmission electron microscopy, we visualize in over five orders-of-magnitude of length-scale the TiC nanoparticles, Al3Ti 3 Ti intermetallics, and their co-locations. 3D reconstructions from TXM revealed a surprising variety of Al3Ti 3 Ti morphologies, including an orthogonal plate structure. By combining our experimental results with phase-field simulations, we demonstrate that this growth form originates from the intermetallic nucleating epitaxially on a TiC particle which is larger than a critical size at a given undercooling. Yet TiC particles that are too small to nucleate Al3Ti 3 Ti can also impact the growth of the intermetallic, by splitting the intermetallic plates during solidification. These insights on the divalent roles of the nanoparticles offer general guidelines for the synthesis and processing of MMNCs.

AB Recent innovations in differentiating cardiomyocytes from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) have unlocked a viable path to creating in vitro cardiac models. Currently, hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) remain immature, leading many in the field to explore approaches to enhance cell and tissue maturation. Here, we systematically analyzed 300 studies using hiPSC-CM models to determine common fabrication, maturation and assessment techniques used to evaluate cardiomyocyte functionality and maturity and compiled the data into an open-access database. Based on this analysis, we present the diversity of, and current trends in, in vitro models and highlight the most common and promising practices for functional assessments. We further analyzed outputs spanning structural maturity, contractile function, electrophysiology and gene expression and note field-wide improvements over time. Finally, we discuss opportunities to collectively pursue the shared goal of hiPSC-CM model development, maturation and assessment that we believe are critical for engineering mature cardiac tissue.
   This Perspective analyzes the most common maturation and assessment techniques for in vitro hiPSC-derived cardiomyocyte models and makes recommendations for standardizations in this field.

TI Prediction of giant tunneling magnetoresistance in RuO2/TiO2/RuO2 (110)
   antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B

DT Article
ID ROOM-TEMPERATURE MAGNETORESISTANCE; SPIN POLARIZATION
AB Using first-principles quantum-transport calculations, we investigate spin-dependent electronic and transport properties of antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions (AFMTJs) that consist of (110)-oriented antiferromagnetic (AFM) metal RuO2 electrodes and an insulating TiO2 tunneling barrier. We predict the emergence of a giant tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect in a wide energy window, a series of barrier layer thicknesses, and different interface terminations, indicating the robustness of this effect. We show that the predicted TMR cannot be explained in terms of the global transport spin-polarization of RuO2 (110) but is well understood based on matching the momentum-dependent spin-polarized conduction channels of the two RuO2 (110) electrodes. We predict oscillations of TMR with increasing barrier thickness, indicating a non-negligible contribution from the perfectly epitaxial interfaces. Our work helps the understanding of the physics of TMR in AFMTJs and aids in realizing efficient AFM spintronic devices.

AB Delocalization error constrains the accuracy of density functional theory in describing molecular interactions in ion-water systems. Using Na+ and Cl- in water as model systems, we calculate the effects of delocalization error in the SCAN functional for describing ion-water and water-water interactions in hydrated ions, and demonstrate that density-corrected SCAN (DC-SCAN) predicts n-body and interaction energies with an accuracy approaching coupled cluster theory. The performance of DC-SCAN is size-consistent, maintaining an accurate description of molecular interactions well beyond the first solvation shell. Molecular dynamics simulations at ambient conditions with many-body MB-SCAN(DC) potentials, derived from the many-body expansion, predict the solvation structure of Na+ and Cl- in quantitative agreement with reference data, while simultaneously reproducing the structure of liquid water. Beyond rationalizing the accuracy of density-corrected models of ion hydration, our findings suggest that our unified density-corrected MB formalism holds great promise for efficient DFT-based simulations of condensed-phase systems with chemical accuracy.

AB We assess racial disparities in the service quality of app-based ride-hailing services, like Uber and Lyft, by simulating their operations in the city of Chicago using empirical data. To generate driver cancellation rate disparities consistent with controlled experiments (up to twice as large for Black riders as for White riders), we estimate that more than 3% of drivers discriminate by race. We find that the capabilities of ride- hailing technology to rapidly rematch after a cancellation and prioritize long-waiting customers heavily mitigates the effects of driver discrimination on rider wait times, reducing average discrimination-induced disparities to less than 1 min-an order of magnitude less than traditional taxis. However, our results suggest that even in the absence of direct driver discrimination, Black riders in Chicago wait about 50% longer, on average, than White riders because of historically informed geographic residential patterns. We estimate that if Black riders in the city had the same wait times as White riders, the collective travel time saved would be worth $4.2 million to $7.0 million per year.

AB Evanescent wave sensors in photonic integrated circuits have been demonstrated for gas sensing applications. While some methods rely on the distinctive response of certain polymers for sensing specific gases, absorption spectroscopy identifies any gas uniquely from their unique vibration signatures. Based on the Beer-Lambert principle, the sensitivity of absorption by a gas on chip relies on the length of the sensing region, the optical overlap integral with the analyte gas and the absorption cross-section at the wavelength with the fundamental vibration signature. The overlap of the optical mode with the analyte has been enhanced in photonic devices by combining slot waveguide confinements with photonic crystal slow light effects. While the absorption cross-section is a property of the gas, the length of the sensing region is limited by the available area on a chip and waveguide propagation losses that limit the minimum signal to noise ratio. In this paper, we show that by incorporating reflecting loop mirrors, the absorption path length can be doubled for the same geometric length of the absorption sensing waveguide. Light from a waveguide is split into two paths, each with a slow light photonic crystal waveguide, by a 2x2 multimode interference (MMI) power splitter. Each path is terminated by a loop mirror that causes the light to retrace its path back down the sensing arms thereby doubling the optical path length over which light interacts with the analyte. Results on the enhancement of phase sensitivity and absorbance sensitivity in the interferometric configuration are presented.

AB We often acquire sensory information from another person's actions to make decisions on how to move, such as when walking through a crowded hallway. Past interactive decision-making research has focused on cognitive tasks that did not allow for sensory information exchange between humans prior to a decision. Here, we test the idea that humans accumulate sensory evidence of another person's intended action to decide their own movement. In a competitive sensorimotor task, we show that humans exploit time to accumulate sensory evidence of another's intended action and utilize this information to decide how to move. We captured this continuous interactive decision-making behaviour with a drift-diffusion model. Surprisingly, aligned with a 'paralysis-by-analysis' phenomenon, we found that humans often waited too long to accumulate sensory evidence and failed to make a decision. Understanding how humans engage in interactive and online decision-making has broad implications that spans sociology, athletics, interactive technology, and economics.

AB Rapid cooling in fast-rate manufacturing processes such as additive manufacturing and stamp forming limits the development of crystallinity in semicrystalline polymer nanocomposites and, therefore, potential improvements in the mechanical performance. While the nucleation, chain mobility, and crystallization time from rapid cooling are known competing mechanisms in crystallization, herein we elucidate that the crystalline morphology and architecture also play a key role in tuning the mechanical performance. We explore how modifying the spherulite morphology via a cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) and graphene nanoplatelet (GNP) hybrid system in their pristine form can improve or preserve the mechanical properties of poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK) nanocomposites under two extreme cooling rates (fast -460 degrees C/min and slow -0.7 degrees C/min). A scalable manufacturing methodology using water as the medium to disperse the powder system was developed, employing a CNC as a dispersing agent and stabilizer for PEEK and GNP. Despite the expected limited mechanical reinforcement due to thermal degradation, CNCs significantly impacted PEEK's crystalline architecture and mechanical performance, suggesting that surface interactions via lattice matching with PEEK's (200) crystallographic plane play a critical role in engineering the microstructure. In fast cooling, the CNC and CNC:GNP systems reduced the crystallinity, respectively, yet led to minimizing the reduction in the tensile strength and maintaining the tensile modulus at the Neat level in slow cooling. With slow cooling, crystallinity remained relatively unchanged; however, the addition of CNC:GNP improved the strength and modulus by similar to 10% and similar to 16%, respectively. These findings demonstrate that a hybrid nanomaterial system can tailor PEEK's crystalline microstructure, thus presenting a promising approach for enhancing the mechanical properties of PEEK nanocomposites in fast-rate processes.

AB Objective: The factors that influence seizure timing are poorly understood, and seizure unpredictability remains a major cause of disability. Work in chronobiology has shown that cyclical physiological phenomena are ubiquitous, with daily and multiday cycles evident in immune, endocrine, metabolic, neurological, and cardiovascular function. Additionally, work with chronic brain recordings has identified that seizure risk is linked to daily and multiday cycles in brain activity. Here, we provide the first characterization of the relationships between the cyclical modulation of a diverse set of physiological signals, brain activity, and seizure timing.Methods: In this cohort study, 14 subjects underwent chronic ambulatory monitoring with a multimodal wrist-worn sensor (recording heart rate, accelerometry, electrodermal activity, and temperature) and an implanted responsive neurostimulation system (recording interictal epileptiform abnormalities and electrographic seizures). Wavelet and filter-Hilbert spectral analyses characterized circadian and multiday cycles in brain and wearable recordings. Circular statistics assessed electrographic seizure timing and cycles in physiology.Results: Ten subjects met inclusion criteria. The mean recording duration was 232 days. Seven subjects had reliable electroencephalographic seizure detections (mean = 76 seizures). Multiday cycles were present in all wearable device signals across all subjects. Seizure timing was phase locked to multiday cycles in five (temperature), four (heart rate, phasic electrodermal activity), and three (accelerometry, heart rate variability, tonic electrodermal activity) subjects. Notably, after regression of behavioral covariates from heart rate, six of seven subjects had seizure phase locking to the residual heart rate signal.Significance: Seizure timing is associated with daily and multiday cycles in multiple physiological processes. Chronic multimodal wearable device recordings can situate rare paroxysmal events, like seizures, within a broader chronobiology context of the individual. Wearable devices may advance the understanding of factors that influence seizure risk and enable personalized time-varying approaches to epilepsy care.

AB An energy harvesting system (EHS) has emerged as an alternative to traditional battery-operated Internet of Things (IoT) devices. An EHS harnesses ambient energy and stores it in a small capacitor, enabling batteryless operation when sufficient energy is available. However, capacitors are susceptible to malicious charging/discharging and over-voltages, which can lead to a loss of capacitance. With the capacitor vulnerability in mind, this article introduces a capacitor hammering attack, simply Caphammer, that can undermine the security of every EHS. The idea is that Caphammer can degrade the capacitance by using frequent power outages. Once Caphammer degrades the capacitor of the victim EHS, it can suffer from denial of service, data corruption, data encryption failure, and abnormal termination. To defeat Caphammer, this article presents FanCap, a capacitor bank scheduling scheme that can dynamically transform energy storage organization, taking into account the capacitor vulnerability. The experimental results demonstrate that FanCap can successfully thwart Caphammer with a negligible run-time overhead.

AB Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems traditionally presuppose that sensing and communication (S&C) channels remain approximately constant during their coherence time. However, a "DISCO" reconfigurable intelligent surface (DRIS), i.e., an illegitimate RIS with random, time-varying reflection properties that acts like a "disco ball," introduces a paradigm shift that enables active channel aging more rapidly during the channel coherence time. In this letter, we investigate the impact of DISCO jamming attacks launched by a DRIS-based fully-passive jammer (FPJ) on an ISAC system. Specifically, an ISAC problem formulation and a corresponding waveform optimization are presented in which the ISAC waveform design considers the trade-off between the S&C performance and is formulated as a Pareto optimization problem. Moreover, a theoretical analysis is conducted to quantify the impact of DISCO jamming attacks. Numerical results are presented to evaluate the S&C performance under DISCO jamming attacks and to validate the derived theoretical analysis.

AB We present 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the fueling of supermassive black holes in elliptical galaxies from a turbulent cooling medium on galactic scales, taking M87* as a typical case. We find that the mass accretion rate is increased by a factor of similar to 10 compared with analogous hydrodynamic simulations. The scaling of M similar to r1/2 roughly holds from similar to 10 pc to similar to 10-3 pc (similar to 10 r g) with the accretion rate through the event horizon being similar to 10-2 M circle dot yr-1. The accretion flow on scales similar to 0.03-3 kpc takes the form of magnetized filaments. Within similar to 30 pc, the cold gas circularizes, forming a highly magnetized (beta similar to 10-3) thick disk supported by a primarily toroidal magnetic field. The cold disk is truncated and transitions to a turbulent hot accretion flow at similar to 0.3 pc (103 r g). There are strong outflows toward the poles driven by the magnetic field. The outflow energy flux increases with smaller accretor size, reaching similar to 3 x 1043 erg s-1 for r in = 8 r g; this corresponds to a nearly constant energy feedback efficiency of eta similar to 0.05-0.1 independent of accretor size. The feedback energy is enough to balance the total cooling of the M87/Virgo hot halo out to similar to 50 kpc. The accreted magnetic flux at small radii is similar to that in magnetically arrested disk models, consistent with the formation of a powerful jet on horizon scales in M87. Our results motivate a subgrid model for accretion in lower-resolution simulations in which the hot gas accretion rate is suppressed relative to the Bondi rate by similar to(10rg/rB)1/2 .

AB Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) will be equipped with onboard deep neural network (DNN) models for processing the data from different sensors and communication units in CAVs and on the roads. In the CAV scenario, each vehicle receives time-series driving signals (e.g., speed, brake status) from nearby vehicles, uses its onboard DNN model for driving maneuver prediction for the nearby vehicles, and then takes corresponding actions for safe and efficient driving. Several black-box adversarial attacks for DNN maneuver classifiers in the CAV scenario have been proposed, in which an attacker deliberately sends false driving signals (i.e., add minimum perturbation to the predicted input) to its nearby vehicle to fool its onboard DNN model to output a wrong class label and cause unwanted traffic incidents or congestion. Though previous research proposed adversarial attack detection methods, the methods are for general DNN models rather than specifically for the time-series driving maneuver classification. To detect such adversarial attacks on the DNN maneuver classifiers in the CAV scenario, in this paper, we analyze the adversarial attacks and propose four different approaches comprised of both statistical and machine learning (ML) based methods. Our trace-driven and real experiments show the combination of all four approaches performs 14% better in accuracy rate and 12% better in precision rate compared to the state-of-the-art statistical and ML-based methods. These improvements are critical for driving safety in CAV scenarios.

AB Few-shot node classification, which aims to predict labels for nodes on graphs with only limited labeled nodes as references, is of great significance in real-world graph mining tasks. To tackle such a label shortage issue, existing works generally leverage the meta-learning framework, which utilizes a number of episodes to extract transferable knowledge from classes with abundant labeled nodes and generalizes the knowledge to other classes with limited labeled nodes. In essence, the primary aim of few-shot node classification is to learn node embeddings that are generalizable across different classes. To accomplish this, the GNN encoder must be able to distinguish node embeddings between different classes, while also aligning embeddings for nodes in the same class. Thus, in this work, we propose to consider both the intra-class and inter-class generalizability of the model. We create a novel contrastive meta-learning framework on graphs, named COSMIC, with two key designs. First, we propose to enhance the intra-class generalizability by involving a contrastive two-step optimization in each episode to explicitly align node embeddings in the same classes. Second, we strengthen the inter-class generalizability by generating hard node classes via a novel similarity-sensitive mix-up strategy. Extensive experiments on few-shot node classification datasets verify the superiority of our framework over state-of-the-art baselines. Our code is provided(1).

AB Diffusion models are powerful, but they require a lot of time and data to train. We propose Patch Diffusion, a generic patch-wise training framework, to significantly reduce the training time costs while improving data efficiency, which thus helps democratize diffusion model training to broader users. At the core of our innovations is a new conditional score function at the patch level, where the patch location in the original image is included as additional coordinate channels, while the patch size is randomized and diversified throughout training to encode the cross-region dependency at multiple scales. Sampling with our method is as easy as in the original diffusion model. Through Patch Diffusion, we could achieve >= 2x faster training, while maintaining comparable or better generation quality. Patch Diffusion meanwhile improves the performance of diffusion models trained on relatively small datasets, e.g., as few as 5,000 images to train from scratch. We achieve outstanding FID scores in line with state-of-the-art benchmarks: 1.77 on CelebA-64x64, 1.93 on AFHQv2-Wild-64x64, and 2.72 on ImageNet-256x256. We share our code and pre-trained models at https://github.com/Zhendong- Wang/Patch- Diffusion.

AB Low-temperature plasma catalysis has shown promise for various chemical processes such as light hydrocarbon conversion, volatile organic compounds removal, and ammonia synthesis. Plasma-catalytic ammonia synthesis has the potential advantages of leveraging renewable energy and distributed manufacturing principles to mitigate the pressing environmental challenges of the energy-intensive Haber-Bosh process, towards sustainable ammonia production. However, lack of foundational understanding of plasma-catalyst interactions poses a key challenge to optimizing plasma-catalytic processes. Recent studies suggest electro- and photoeffects, such as electric field and charge, can play an important role in enhancing surface reactions. These studies mostly rely on using density functional theory (DFT) to investigate surface reactions under these effects. However, integration of DFT with microkinetic modeling in plasma catalysis, which is crucial for establishing a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between the gas-phase chemistry and surface reactions, remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a first-principles framework coupling DFT calculations and microkinetic modeling to investigate the role of electric field on plasma-catalytic ammonia synthesis. The DFT-microkinetic model shows more consistent predictions with experimental observations, as compared to the case wherein the variable effects of plasma process parameters on surface reactions are neglected. In particular, predictions of the DFT-microkinetic model indicate electric field can have a notable effect on surface reactions relative to other process parameters. A global sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate how ammonia synthesis pathways will change in relation to different plasma process parameters. The DFT-microkinetic model is then used in conjunction with active learning to systematically explore the complex parameter space of the plasma-catalytic ammonia synthesis to maximize the amount of produced ammonia while inhibiting reactions dissipating energy, such as the recombination of H-2 through gas-phase H radicals and surface-adsorbed H. This paper demonstrates the importance of accounting for the effects of electric field on surface reactions when investigating and optimizing the performance of plasma-catalytic processes.

ID SCATTERING; SPIN
AB Charge-exchange reactions are versatile probes for nuclear structure. In particular, when populating isobaric analog states, these reactions are used to study isovector nuclear densities and neutron skins. The quality of the information extracted from charge-exchange data depends on the accuracy of the reaction models and their inputs; this work addresses these two points. First, we quantify the uncertainties due to effective nucleon-nucleus interactions by propagating the parameter posterior distributions of the recent global optical model KDUQ [C. D. Pruitt, J. E. Escher, and R. Rahman, Phys. Rev. C 107, 014602 (2023)] to (p, n) reaction observables populating the isobaric analog state, at beam energies in the range of 25-160 MeV. Our analysis, focusing on 48Ca, shows that the total parametric uncertainties on the cross sections are around 60-100%. The source of this uncertainty is mainly the transition operator as the uncertainties from the distorted waves alone are less than about 15%. Second, we perform a comparison between two- and three-body models that both describe the dynamics of the reaction within the DWBA. The predictions from these two models are similar and generally agree with the available data, suggesting that one-step DWBA is sufficient to describe the reaction process. Only at a beam energy of 25 MeV are there possible signs that a one-step assumption is not fully correct. This work provides motivation for the quantification of uncertainties associated with the transition operator in three-body model. It also suggests that further constraint of the optical potential parameters is needed for increased model precision.

DT Article
AB Identifying untapped opportunities for crop production improvement in current cropland is crucial to guide food availability interventions. Here we integrated an agronomically robust bottom-up approach with machine learning to generate global maps of yield potential of high resolution (ca. 1 km2 at the Equator) and accuracy for maize, wheat and rice. These maps serve as a robust reference to benchmark farmers' yields in the context of current cropping systems and water regimes and can help to identify areas with large room to increase crop yields.
   High-resolution global maps of yield potential were created through crop modelling and machine learning. These maps can help orient agricultural research and development programmes and assess food security and land use from local to regional levels.

   properties of a viscoelastic fluid

AB At low Reynolds numbers, "swirlers" - swimmers with an axisymmetric "head"and "tail" counterrotating about the axis of symmetry - generate no net propulsion in a Newtonian fluid as a consequence of the "scallop theorem". Viscoelasticity in the suspending fluid breaks the time-reversibility and allows swirlers to propel themselves, with the swim speed being a function of swimmer geometry, fluid elasticity, and swimming gait. Using analytical theory and numerical simulations, we study the unsteady motion of a freely-suspended self-propelled swirler though viscoelastic fluids described by the Giesekus model, allowing for general axisymmetric geometry and time-dependent tail rotation rate. We show the steady swim speed can be calculated for general arbitrary axisymmetric geometries at low Deborah number via the reciprocal theorem and the solution of two Newtonian flow problems. In this "weak flow" limit, we analytically determine the swim speed and its dependence on the parameters of the Giesekus fluid which in turn are related to the primary and secondary normal stress coefficients Psi(1) and Psi(2). Furthermore, at low De, we derive the unsteady swim speed as a function of a specified unsteady tail rotation rate and the material properties of the suspending fluid. We show that for a particular tail rotation rate, the unsteady swim speed can be analyzed to recover the spectrum of fluid relaxation times, analogous to small-amplitude oscillatory shear measurements on a benchtop rheometer. This study expands upon the design space for a "swimming rheometer" by increasing its functionality to make and interpret rheological measurements.

ID EMERGENCE
AB SARS-CoV-2 mutation is minimized through a proofreading function encoded by NSP-14. Most estimates of the SARS-CoV-2 mutation rate are derived from population based sequence data. Our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 evolution might be enhanced through analysis of intra-host viral mutation rates in specific populations. Viral genome analysis was performed between paired samples and mutations quantified at allele frequencies (AF) >= 0.25, >= 0.5 and >= 0.75. Mutation rate was determined employing F81 and JC69 evolution models and compared between isolates with (Delta NSP-14) and without (wtNSP-14) non-synonymous mutations in NSP-14 and by patient comorbidity. Forty paired samples with median interval of 13 days [IQR 8.5-20] were analyzed. The estimated mutation rate by F81 modeling was 93.6 (95%CI 90.8-96.4], 40.7 (95%CI 38.9-42.6) and 34.7 (95%CI 33.0-36.4) substitutions/genome/year at AF >= 0.25, >= 0.5, >= 0.75 respectively. Mutation rate in Delta NSP-14 were significantly elevated at AF >= 0.25 vs wtNSP-14. Patients with immune comorbidities had higher mutation rate at all allele frequencies. Intra-host SARS-CoV-2 mutation rates are substantially higher than those reported through population analysis. Virus strains with altered NSP-14 have accelerated mutation rate at low AF. Immunosuppressed patients have elevated mutation rate at all AF. Understanding intra-host virus evolution will aid in current and future pandemic modeling.

AB Much of the modern Kuiper belt is thought to be the result of Neptune's migration through a primordial belt of planetesimals, possibly interrupted by an instability amongst the giant planets. While most prior work has employed massless test particles to study this Kuiper belt formation process, we perform simulations here that include the gravitational effects of the primordial planetesimal belt consisting of similar to 10 5 massive bodies. In our simulations, Neptune unlocks from resonance with the other giant planets and begins to migrate outward due to interactions with planetesimals before a planetary orbital instability is triggered, and afterward, residual Neptunian migration completes the formation of the modern Kuiper belt. Compared to past simulations using massless test particles, our present work exhibits a number of notable differences. First, Neptune's planetary resonance unlocking requires the Neptunian 3:2 mean motion resonance to sweep much of the primordial disk interior to 30 au prior to the giant planet instability. This generates a pre-instability population of planetesimals that is significantly lower in semimajor axis, eccentricity, and inclination than predicted by many prior models, and this effect persists after the instability. Second, direct scattering between Pluto -mass bodies and other small bodies removes material from Neptunian resonances significantly more efficiently than the resonant dropout resulting from small changes in Neptune's semimajor axis during scattering between Pluto -mass bodies and Neptune. Consequently, the primordial population of Pluto -mass bodies may be as few as similar to 200 objects. Finally, our simulation end states display a wide variety of orbital distributions, and straightforward relationships between final bulk Kuiper belt properties and Neptune's migration or initial planetesimal properties largely elude us. In particular, we find that the rapid, stochastic planetary orbital evolution occurring during the giant planet instability can significantly alter final Kuiper belt properties such as its inclination dispersion and the prominence of resonant populations. This complicates efforts to use modern Kuiper belt properties to confidently constrain early solar system events and conditions, including planetary orbital migration and the primordial Kuiper belt's characteristics.

AB Network compression methods minimize the number of network parameters and computation costs while maintaining desired network performance. However, the safety assurance of many compression methods is based on a large amount of experimental data, whereas unforeseen incidents beyond the experiment data may result in unsafe consequences. In this work, we developed a discrepancy computation method for two convolutional neural networks by giving a concrete value to characterize the maximum output difference between the two networks after compression. Using Imagestar-based reachability analysis, we propose a novel method to merge the two networks to compute the difference. We illustrate reachability computation for each layer in the merged network, such as the convolution, max pooling, fully connected, and ReLU layers. We apply our method to a numerical example to prove its correctness. Furthermore, we implement our developed methods on the VGG16 model with the Quantization Aware Training (QAT) compression method; the results show that our approach can efficiently compute the accurate maximum output discrepancy between the original neural network and the compressed neural network.

AB Multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) is a beneficial technique for diagnosing and analyzing biological samples since it provides meticulous details in anatomy and physiology. However, acquiring high through-plane resolution volumetric MSOT is time-consuming. Here, we propose a deep learning model based on hybrid recurrent and convolutional neural networks to generate sequential cross-sectional images for an MSOT system. This system provides three modalities (MSOT, ultrasound, and optoacoustic imaging of a specific exogenous contrast agent) in a single scan. This study used ICG-conjugated nanoworms particles (NWs-ICG) as the contrast agent. Instead of acquiring seven images with a step size of 0.1 mm, we can receive two images with a step size of 0.6 mm as input for the proposed deep learning model. The deep learning model can generate five other images with a step size of 0.1 mm between these two input images meaning we can reduce acquisition time by approximately 71%.

AB A large volume of data is typically needed to achieve an accurate solar generation prediction. However, not all types of data are consistently available. Various research efforts have addressed this challenge by developing methods that identify the most relevant features for predicting solar generation. However, the optimal features vary with different weather patterns, making it impossible to select a fixed set of optimal features for all weather patterns. This study develops a new framework to accurately predict solar irradiance using dynamically changing optimal features. The developed model first incorporates feature extraction with clustering techniques to identify representative weather data from a dataset. Next, using deep reinforcement learning (DRL), a new feature selection method is developed to yield the minimum features required to accurately forecast solar irradiance from representative data. Benefiting from the model-free nature of DRL, the developed method is adaptive to various weather conditions, and dynamically alters the selected features. Case studies using real-world data have shown that the developed model significantly reduces the volume of data required for accurate irradiance forecasting for different weather patterns.

AB An alchemical enhanced sampling (ACES) method has recently been introduced to facilitate importance sampling in free energy simulations. The method achieves enhanced sampling from Hamiltonian replica exchange within a dual topology framework while utilizing new smoothstep softcore potentials. A common sampling problem encountered in lead optimization is the functionalization of aromatic rings that exhibit distinct conformational preferences when interacting with the protein. It is difficult to converge the distribution of ring conformations due to the long time scale of ring flipping events; however, the ACES method addresses this issue by modeling the syn and anti ring conformations within a dual topology. ACES thereby samples the conformer distributions by alchemically tunneling between states, as opposed to traversing a physical pathway with a high rotational barrier. We demonstrate the use of ACES to overcome conformational sampling issues involving ring flipping in ML300-derived noncovalent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease (M-pro). The demonstrations explore how the use of replica exchange and the choice of softcore selection affects the convergence of the ring conformation distributions. Furthermore, we examine how the accuracy of the calculated free energies is affected by the degree of phase space overlap (PSO) between adjacent states (i.e., between neighboring lambda-windows) and the Hamiltonian replica exchange acceptance ratios. Both of these factors are sensitive to the spacing between the intermediate states. We introduce a new method for choosing a schedule of lambda values. The method analyzes short "burn-in" simulations to construct a 2D map of the nonlocal PSO. The schedule is obtained by optimizing an alchemical pathway on the 2D map that equalizes the PSO between the lambda intervals. The optimized phase space overlap lambda-spacing method (Opt-PSO) leads to more numerous end-to-end single passes and round trips due to the correlation between PSO and Hamiltonian replica exchange acceptance ratios. The improved exchange statistics enhance the efficiency of ACES method. The method has been implemented into the FE-ToolKit software package, which is freely available.

AB From wearable health tracking to sensor-laden cities, AI-enhanced pervasive sensing platforms promise far-reaching benefits yet also introduce societal risks. How might designers of these platforms effectively navigate their complex ecology and sociotechnical dynamics? To explore this question, we interviewed designers building mental health technologies who undertook this challenge. They are hospital chief medical information officers and startup founders together striving to create new sensors/AI platforms and integrate them into the healthcare ecosystem. We found that, while all designers aspired to build comprehensive care platforms, their efforts focused on serving either consumers or physicians, delivering a subset of healthcare interventions, and demonstrating system effectiveness one metric at a time. Consequently, breakdowns in patient journeys are emerging; societal risks loom large. We describe how the data economy, designers' mindsets, and evaluation challenges led to these unintended design consequences. We discuss implications for designing pervasive sensing and AI platforms for social good.

AB Most existing studies on racial bias reduction have used short-term interracial interaction interventions with fleeting effects. The current natural experiment examined whether daily interactions with other-race nannies relate to reduced racial bias in the preschool years. We capitalized on a unique child-rearing situation in Singapore whereby children are often cared for by other-race nannies since infancy. Singaporean Chinese 3- to 6-year-olds (N = 100) completed explicit and implicit racial bias measures assessing their preferential bias favoring own-race adults over adults of their nannies' race. Differential findings were obtained for children's explicit and implicit racial bias. Extensiveness, but not mere presence, of other-race nanny experience was associated with lower levels of explicit racial bias in children. In contrast, neither presence nor extensiveness of other-race nanny experience was associated with children's implicit racial bias. Together, these findings suggest that long-term and extensive contact with an other-race caregiver could have subtle mitigating effects on children's explicit, but not implicit, racial bias.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB Calcification is vital to marine organisms that produce calcium carbonate shells and skeletons. However, how calcification is impacted by ongoing environmental changes, including ocean acidification, remains incompletely understood due to complex relationships among the carbonate system variables hypothesized to drive calcification. Here, we experimentally decouple these drivers in an exploration of shell formation in adult marine mussels, Mytilus californianus. In contrast to models that focus on single parameters like calcium carbonate saturation state, our results implicate two independent factors, bicarbonate concentration and seawater pH, in governing calcification. While qualitatively similar to ideas embodied in the related substrate-inhibitor ratio (bicarbonate divided by hydrogen ion concentration), our data highlight that merging bicarbonate ion and hydrogen ion concentrations into a simple quotient obscures important features of calcification. Considering a dual-parameter framework improves mechanistic understanding of how calcifiers interact with complex and changing chemical conditions.
   When exposed to different alkalinity and pH combinations, calcification and shell formation in the adult marine mussel Mytilus californianus responds most strongly to bicarbonate ion concentration and pH, according to a series of incubation experiments.

TI Five million years of Antarctic Circumpolar Current strength variability
SO NATURE
LA English
DT Article
ID SOUTHERN-OCEAN; PACIFIC; STRATIFICATION; CIRCULATION; CLIMATE; RECORD
AB The Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) represents the world's largest ocean-current system and affects global ocean circulation, climate and Antarctic ice-sheet stability 1-3 . Today, ACC dynamics are controlled by atmospheric forcing, oceanic density gradients and eddy activity 4 . Whereas palaeoceanographic reconstructions exhibit regional heterogeneity in ACC position and strength over Pleistocene glacial-interglacial cycles 5-8 , the long-term evolution of the ACC is poorly known. Here we document changes in ACC strength from sediment cores in the Pacific Southern Ocean. We find no linear long-term trend in ACC flow since 5.3 million years ago (Ma), in contrast to global cooling 9 and increasing global ice volume 10 . Instead, we observe a reversal on a million-year timescale, from increasing ACC strength during Pliocene global cooling to a subsequent decrease with further Early Pleistocene cooling. This shift in the ACC regime coincided with a Southern Ocean reconfiguration that altered the sensitivity of the ACC to atmospheric and oceanic forcings 11-13 . We find ACC strength changes to be closely linked to 400,000-year eccentricity cycles, probably originating from modulation of precessional changes in the South Pacific jet stream linked to tropical Pacific temperature variability 14 . A persistent link between weaker ACC flow, equatorward-shifted opal deposition and reduced atmospheric CO2 during glacial periods first emerged during the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT). The strongest ACC flow occurred during warmer-than-present intervals of the Plio-Pleistocene, providing evidence of potentially increasing ACC flow with future climate warming.
   The strength of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, as traced in sediment cores from the Pacific Southern Ocean, shows no linear long-term trend over the past 5.3 Myr; instead, the strongest flow occurs consistently in warmer-than-present intervals.

ID WATER; SIMULATION; FAILURE; MODEL
AB Using an interatomic potential that can capture the tetrahedral configuration of water molecules (H2O) in ice without the need to explicitly track the motion of the O and H atoms, coarse-grained (CG) atomistic simulations are performed here to characterize the structures, energy, cohesive strengths, and fracture resistance of the grain boundaries (GBs) in polycrystalline ice resulting from water freezing. Taking the symmetric tilt grain boundaries (STGBs) with a tilting axis of < 0001 > as an example, several main findings from our simulations are (i) the GB energy, E-GB, exhibits a strong dependence on the GB misorientation angle, theta. The classical Read-Shockley model only predicts the E-GB - theta relation reasonably well when theta < 20 degrees or theta > 45 degrees but fails when 20 degrees < theta < 45 degrees; (ii) two "valleys" appear in the E-GB-theta landscape. One occurs at theta = 22 degrees for Sigma 14(2310) GB, and the other is at theta = 32 degrees for Sigma 26(3410) GB. These two GBs might be the most common in polycrystalline ice; (iii) all the STGB structures under consideration here are found to be a collection of edge dislocations with a Burgers vector of b = 1/3 < 1120 >. The core structure of this edge dislocation is composed of a pentagon and a heptagon atomic ring. The separation and orientation of the structure units (SUs) at the GB exhibit a strong dependence on theta; (iv) the length of an atomic bond within the SUs, rather than E-GB and theta which are often used in the literature, is identified as one controlling parameter that dictates the intrinsic GB cohesive strength; (v) characterization of the fracture resistance of the GB containing an initial crack is beyond the reach of nanoscale atomistic simulations but is feasible in concurrent atomistic-continuum (CAC) simulations that can simultaneously retain the atomic GB structure together with the long-range stress field within one model. The above findings provide researchers with a stepping stone to understand the complex microstructure of polycrystalline ice and its response to external forces from the bottom up. Such knowledge may be consolidated into constitutive rules and then transferred into the higher length scale models, such as cohesive zone finite element models (CZFEMs), for predicting how polycrystalline ice fractures at laboratory and even geophysical length scales.

ID STACKING-FAULT ENERGIES; LATTICE DISTORTION; DEFORMATION; MECHANISM;
   BEHAVIOR
AB Using hybrid molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations, we examine the role of lattice distortion (LD) and chemical short-range ordering (CSRO) on the development of defects ahead of a mode I crack in medium entropy alloy CoCrNi. We show that CSRO noticeably increases fracture toughness. The result can be explained by the effect of CSRO on lowering LD and increasing intrinsic stacking fault energy and the direct impact CSRO has on the energetic barriers for emitting partial dislocations and forming nanotwins from CoCr clusters on the crack tip. CSRO allows the nanotwin domains to further support inelastic deformation, such as dislocation glide and amorphization, leading to stable crack-tip plasticity and postponement of softening. These findings imply that the superior fracture toughness in CoCrNi can be attributed to the non-negligible CSRO that naturally exists.

ID COMPOSITE FILMS
AB There is a continuous demand for more sensitive detectors of ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Popular silicon-based optoelectronic photodetectors perform poorly in UV spectrum. Integration of photoluminescent (PL) media capable of down-converting UV into visible (VIS) light (more suitable for silicon) with the photodetectors improve their UV sensitivity. We considered two such media: polymer nanocomposites impregnated with the nanoparticles (NPs) of perovskite CsPbBr3 and phosphor NaEuF4. We proposed to enhance the photoluminescence (PL) of the spectrum downconverting nanocomposites by embedding the nanoparticles (NPs) of high-entropy metal alloys (HEA) and using the surface plasmon polariton (SPP) resonance effect in such NPs. We proposed to fabricate HEA NPs and embed them in the nanocomposite using the patented concurrent multi-beam multi-target pulsed laser deposition (CMBMT-PLD) method. A two-step approach for making the nanocomposites impregnated with HEA NPs includes making HEA films using CMBMT-PLD followed by laser ablation of the films, formation of the HEA NPs during such ablation, and embedding them into a polymer matrix. By simulating the latter process with the ablation of the deposited HEA films in water the extension of the SPP resonance to the long-wave UV region (450 nm) has been demonstrated. A manifold improvement of the PL intensity of the nanocomposites due to SPP resonance in the embedded HEA NPs is expected. The obtained results will have an impact on the science and applications of short-wavelength sensors.

AB 2D van der Waals (vdW) materials are emerging as the next generation platform for optical and electronic devices with their wide coverage of the energy bandgaps. The strong light-matter interactions in 2D vdW layers allow for exploring novel optical and electronic phenomena such as 2D polaritons exhibiting ultrahigh field confinement, defects-induced new quantum states, and strain-modulated quantum confinement of 2D excitons. Far-field optical imaging techniques are extensively used to characterize the 2D vdW materials so far, however, subdiffraction spatial resolution is required for comprehensive investigations of 2D vdW materials of which physical properties are greatly influenced by local defects and strain. This article aims to cover historical advances, fundamental principles, and distinct features of emerging near-field optical imaging techniques: scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy, tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, tip-enhanced photoluminescence techniques, and photo-induced force microscopy. The recent developments toward spectroscopic analysis of near-field imaging and applications for unveiling unique properties of 2D polaritons, nanoscale defects, and mechanical strains in 2D vdW materials, are also discussed. This review article provides an understanding of emerging near-field imaging techniques and suggests prospective applications for exploring 2D vdW materials.

AB We are living amidst a pandemic caused by a ravaging coronavirus and an accompanying pandemic of misinformation that has strained our economy and socio-political institutions. A key scientific goal is to examine mechanisms that lead to the widespread propagation of contagions, e.g., misinformation and pathogens, and identify risk factors that can trigger widespread outbreaks. A common phenomenon underlying the spread of disease and misinformation epidemics is the evolution of the contagion as it propagates, leading to the emergence of different strains, e.g., through genetic mutations in pathogens and alterations in the information content. Recent studies have revealed that models that do not account for heterogeneity in transmission risks associated with different strains of the circulating contagion can lead to inaccurate predictions. However, existing results on multi-strain spreading assume that the network has a vanishingly small clustering coefficient, whereas, clustering is widely known to be a fundamental property of real-world social networks.
   In this work, we investigate spreading processes that entail evolutionary adaptations on random graphs with tunable clustering and arbitrary degree distributions. We derive a mathematical framework that predicts the epidemic threshold and the probability of emergence as functions of the characteristics of the spreading object, the evolutionary pathways of the pathogen/misinformation, and the structure of the underlying network as given by the joint degree distribution of single-edges and triangles. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to jointly characterize the impact of clustering and evolution on the emergence of epidemic outbreaks. We supplement our theoretical finding with numerical simulations and case studies, shedding light on how clustering can offer pathways for mutation, thereby altering the course of the epidemic.

AB Photocatalytic conversion of nitrogen to ammonia is a green alternative for the Haber-Bosch process. The current progress in photocatalytic nitrogen reduction suggests, however, that there exists a large gap in performance before commercial use is viable. One of the major challenges is that no highly active photocatalysts exist. Furthermore, the development of photocatalysts is greatly hindered by false positives or non-reproducible data. Here, we will describe the current known causes of non-reproducible results in the literature and present solutions to mitigate these false positive results. Finally, we highlight the main challenges that remain for photocatalytic nitrogen fixation. We aim to help researchers design more reliable experiments and inspire practical research in developing photocatalytic ammonia synthesis.

AB FTIR spectroscopy accompanied by quantum chemical simulations can reveal important information about molecular structure and intermolecular interactions in the condensed phase. Simulations typically account for the solvent either through cluster quantum mechanical (QM) models, polarizable continuum models (PCM), or hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) models. Recently, we studied the effect of aqueous solvent interactions on the vibrational frequencies of lumiflavin, a minimal flavin model, using cluster QM and PCM models. Those models successfully reproduced the relative frequencies of four prominent stretching modes of flavin's isoalloxazine ring in the diagnostic 1450-1750 cm-1 range but poorly reproduced the relative band intensities. Here, we extend our studies on this system and account for solvation through a series of increasingly sophisticated models. Only by combining elements of QM clusters, QM/MM, and PCM approaches do we obtain an improved agreement with the experiment. The study sheds light more generally on factors that can impact the computed frequencies and intensities of IR bands in solution.

AB Humans often move in the presence of mechanical disturbances that can vary in direction and amplitude throughout movement. These disturbances can jeopar-dize the outcomes of our actions, such as when drinking from a glass of water on a turbulent flight or carrying a cup of coffee while walking on a busy sidewalk. Here, we examine control strategies that allow the nervous system to maintain performance when reaching in the presence of mechanical disturbances that vary randomly throughout movement. Healthy participants altered their control strategies to make movements more robust against disturbances. The change in control was associated with faster reaching movements and increased responses to proprioceptive and visual feedback that were tuned to the variability of the disturbances. Our findings highlight that the nervous system exploits a contin-uum of control strategies to increase its responsiveness to sensory feedback when reaching in the presence of increasingly variable physical disturbances.

AB As one technique for autonomous driving, vehicular networks can achieve high efficiency with vehicle-andinfrastructure cooperation, bringing high safety and many valueadded services. To achieve higher communication efficiency, much effort has been done to cope with the resource allocation issues for vehicular networks. Nevertheless, due to the strong nonconvexity and nonlinearity, the classical joint resource allocation problem in vehicular networks is typically NP-hard. The multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as a promising solution to tackle this challenge but its stability and scalability are not satisfactory when the amount of vehicles gets increased. In this article, we mainly investigate the issue of joint spectrum and power allocation in vehicular communication networks, and carefully consider the interactions between the vehicles and environment by incorporating the cooperative stochastic game theory with MARL, named complete-game MARL (CG-MARL), to achieve a better convergence and stability with the theoretical computational complexity O(n(N)) with ndenoting the dimension of action space and N denoting the number of V2X Vehicular. Furthermore, the mean-field game (MFG) theory is employed to further enhance the MARL for decreasing the horrible computing resource consumption caused by the CGMARL to O(n(2)) while maintaining an approximate performance. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed meanfield-aided MARL (MF-MARL) for vehicular network resource allocation can achieve 95% near-optimal performance with much lower complexity, which indicates its significant potentials in the scenarios with massive and dense vehicles.

AB Ocean outfalls, a primary means of municipal and industrial wastewater disposal in coastal communities around the world, are designed to take advantage of transport by the ocean circulation for wastewater dispersal. However, studies that comprehensively characterize the effect of anthropogenic nitrogen discharged via ocean outfalls on coastal eutrophication remain limited. Here, we investigate the effects of the following individual component of outfall discharge on net primary production (NPP): (1) inorganic nitrogen input, (2) freshwater input, and (3) inorganic nitrogen form. To this end, we develop a series of idealized scenarios utilizing an ocean biogeochemical model of the Southern California Bight, a highly urbanized coastal region affected by wastewater discharge. We find that a greater volume of freshwater input via wastewater expands the spatial footprint of NPP changes, allowing for a greater spatial dispersion of nutrients, but does not decrease the NPP averaged over a coastal band. In contrast, introducing nutrient loads in a more concentrated wastewater volume causes a patchier distribution of NPP, and can result in higher NPP in embayments characterized by longer water residence times. Ammonium-dominated wastewater stimulates 40% more productivity than nitrate- dominated wastewater for the same DIN addition. These changes are modulated by the seasonal cycle, with greatest impacts during the weakly-stratified regime in wintertime. By using a realistic ocean biogeochemical model, we quantify changes to nearshore nutrients and productivity at horizontal, vertical, and temporal scales that remain challenging to monitor by in situ or remote sensing techniques, offering new insights for water quality management.

ID PULSES
AB We present a single-shot detection method of terahertz correlated second harmonic generation in plasma-based sources by directly mixing an optical probe into femtosecond laser induced plasma filaments in air. The single-shot second harmonic trace is obtained by measuring a second harmonic generation on a conventional CCD with a spatiotemporally distorted probe beam. The system shows a spectrometer resolution of 22 fs/pixel on the CCD and a true resolution on the order of the probe pulse duration. With considerable THz peak electric field strength, this formalism can open the door to single-shot THz detection without bandwidth limitations. (c) 2024 Optica Publishing Group

AB N-Nitrosamines, many of which are carcinogenic, mutagenic, and teratogenic, are disinfection byproducts (DBPs) formed from the reaction of chloramine with nitrogenous organic compounds during water disinfection. The identification of major nitrosamine precursors is important to understand and prevent nitrosamine formation. In this analysis, we propose that efforts to identify nitrosamine precursors must look beyond conventionally evaluated active agent chemicals to consider inert or inactive chemicals as potentially relevant precursors. Using agricultural chemicals applied in the US as an example, we demonstrate that amines widely used as inactive agents in herbicide formulations (i.e., dimethylamine [DMA], a known N-nitrosamine precursor) are potentially much more important than active agent herbicides previously evaluated as potential nitrosamine precursors (i.e., the herbicides diuron or trifluralin). Accounting for use rates and nitrosamine yields, amines used in herbicide formulations represent potential nitrosamine precursor inputs to the environment that are similar in magnitude to recognized precursors like the pharmaceuticals ranitidine and metformin. Because the amounts of amines used as inert agents in herbicide formulations have increased dramatically over recent decades, particularly in certain US regions, we suggest that identification of potential nitrosamine precursors should consider variation in the inputs of both active and inactive agents over time, as well as geographical variation in use that may alter the relative importance of specific precursors in certain locations.

AB Wholesale market participation of storage with state-of-charge (SoC) dependent bids results in a non-convex cost in a multi-interval economic dispatch, which requires a mixed-integer linear program in the market clearing. We show that the economic dispatch can be convexified to the standard linear program when the SoC-dependent bid satisfies the equal decremental-cast ratio (EDCR) condition. Such EDCR bids are shown to support individual rationalities of all market participants in both the day-ahead multi-interval economic dispatch under locational marginal pricing and the rolling-window look-ahead dispatch under temporal-locational marginal pricing in the real-time market. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate a higher profit margin with an SoC-dependent bid over that from an SoC-independent bid.

AB Despite the overarching history of species divergence, phylogenetic studies often reveal distinct topologies across regions of the genome. The sources of these gene tree discordances are variable, but incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) and hybridization are among those with the most biological importance. Petunia serves as a classic system for studying hybridization in the wild. While field studies suggest that hybridization is frequent, the extent of reticulation within Petunia and its closely related genera has never been examined from a phylogenetic perspective. In this study, we used transcriptomic data from 11 Petunia , 16 Calibrachoa , and 10 Fabiana species to illuminate the relationships between these species and investigate whether hybridization played a significant role in the diversification of the clade. We inferred that gene tree discordance within genera is linked to hybridization events along with high levels of ILS due to their rapid diversification. Moreover, network analyses estimated deeper hybridization events between Petunia and Calibrachoa , genera that have different chromosome numbers. Although these genera cannot hybridize at the present time, ancestral hybridization could have played a role in their parallel radiations, as they share the same habitat and life history.

AB Identifying and understanding various causal relations are fundamental to climate dynamics for improving the predictive capacity of Earth system modeling. In particular, causality in Earth systems has manifest temporal periodicities, like physical climate variabilities. To unravel the characteristic frequency of causality in climate dynamics, we develop a data-analytic framework based on a combination of causality detection and Hilbert spectral analysis, using a long-term temperature and precipitation dataset in the contiguous United States. Using the Huang-Hilbert transform, we identify the intrinsic frequencies of cross-regional causality for precipitation and temperature, ranging from interannual to interdecadal time scales. In addition, we analyze the spectra of the physical climate variabilities, including El Ni & ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation. It is found that the intrinsic causal frequencies are positively associated with the physics of the oscillations in the global climate system. The proposed methodology provides fresh insights into the causal connectivity in Earth's hydroclimatic system and its underlying mechanism as regulated by the characteristic low-frequency variability associated with various climatic dynamics.
   We identified the causality for precipitation and temperature climatology among different climate regions in the contiguous United States using the convergent cross-mapping method. The cross-regional causality has manifest periodicities, ranging from interannual to interdecadal scales. The intrinsic frequencies characterized by Huang-Hilbert transform can be correlated to physical climate variabilities, including El Ni & ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation. image

ID WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS; SYSTEMS; SCHEME; POWER
AB Emerging intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) significantly improve system performance, but also pose a huge risk for physical layer security. Existing works have illustrated that a disco IRS (DIRS), i.e., an illegitimate IRS with random time-varying reflection properties (like a "disco ball"), can be employed by an attacker to actively age the channels of legitimate users (LUs). Such active channel aging (ACA) generated by the DIRS can be employed to jam multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) systems without relying on either jamming power or LU channel state information (CSI). To address the significant threats posed by DIRS-based fully-passive jammers (FPJs), an anti-jamming precoder is proposed that requires only the statistical characteristics of the DIRS-based ACA channels instead of their CSI. The statistical characteristics of DIRS-jammed channels are first derived, and then the anti-jamming precoder is derived based on the statistical characteristics. Furthermore, we prove that the anti-jamming precoder can achieve the maximum signal-to-jamming-plus-noise ratio (SJNR). To acquire the ACA statistics without changing the system architecture or cooperating with the illegitimate DIRS, we design a data frame structure that the legitimate access point (AP) can use to estimate the statistical characteristics. During the designed data frame, the LUs only need to feed back their received power to the legitimate AP when they detect jamming attacks. Numerical results are also presented to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed anti-jamming precoder against the DIRS-based FPJs and the feasibility of the designed data frame used by the legitimate AP to estimate the statistical characteristics.

AB Fires and burning are the chief causes of particulate matter (PM2.5), a key measurement of air quality in communities and cities worldwide. This work develops a live fire tracking platform to show active reported fires from over twenty cities in the U.S., as well as predict their smoke paths and impacts on the air quality of regions within their range. Specifically, our close to real-time tracking and predictions culminates in a digital twin to protect public health and inform the public of fire and air quality risk. This tool tracks fire incidents in real-time, utilizes the 3D building footprints of Austin to simulate smoke outputs, and predicts fire incident smoke falloffs within the complex city environment. Results from this study include a complete fire and smoke digital twin model for Austin. We work in cooperation with the City of Austin Fire Department to ensure the accuracy of our forecast and also show that air quality sensor density within our cities cannot validate urban fire presence. We additionally release code and methodology to replicate these results for any city in the world. This work paves the path for similar digital twin models to be developed and deployed to better protect the health and safety of citizens.

AB According to NSF (2017), even though the number of minority students in America's college-age population has been on the rise, those who choose Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) as their majors are significantly fewer. There is an urgent need for African Americans, being the underrepresented minorities in STEM-related domains, be provided with opportunities to increase their presence and achievements (Hansen, Palakal & White, Journal for STEM Education Research, 1-26 2023). This paper was to develop an active flipped learning (AFL) model to enhance engineering students learning. Instructional video, audio, lecture notes, and reading materials are developed while initiating active learning activities in class to engage students in active flipped learning. By monitoring 103 students' engagement and identifying their motivation and learning strategies, a custom-tailored plan to fit each underrepresented student in STEM was formed, valued by two indicators: Engaged Learning Index and Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire. After practicing the longitudinal research for three years from 2016 to 2018, some results were found during the procedure through ANOVA and correlation analysis on the collected data. The AFL model effectively promotes underrepresented students' performance in various science disciplines such as engineering, physics, and mathematics, such as helpful to foster underrepresented students' deep understanding of STEM disciplines and making them more engaged in STEM learning. In the future, the AFL can be potentially expanded to other institutions to help all students succeed in STEM classrooms and careers, to increase the national STEM literacy and be applied to non-STEM majors.

AB Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging has long been proven useful for numerous medical applications, especially image-guided surgery since it can deeply penetrate tissue and acquire a fluorescence image from the FDA-approved fluorescence dye known as indocyanine green (ICG). NIR imaging-guided surgery can help enhance outcomes by better defining surgical margins and minimizing operative time. However, most commercial NIR fluorescence imaging systems are bulky and expensive. In this work, we introduce a low-cost and portable NIR fluorescence imaging system. The proposed system exploits an inexpensive complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) based on Nyxel((R)) technology, considerably improving quantum efficiency (QE) in the NIR range. Therefore, it can acquire a NIR fluorescence image with outstanding quality. Furthermore, we conjugated ICG with nanoworm particles (NWs-ICG) since nanoparticle-conjugated dye can increase accumulation in a tumor. We show impressive applications of our system for ex vivo tissues and in vivo image-guided surgery using NWs-ICG as a contrast agent for breast tumors from transgenic mice.

AB With the ever-increasing abundance of biomedical articles, improving the accuracy of keyword search results becomes crucial for ensuring reproducible research. However, keyword extraction for biomedical articles is hard due to the existence of obscure keywords and the lack of a comprehensive benchmark. PubMedAKE is an author-assigned keyword extraction dataset that contains the title, abstract, and keywords of over 843,269 articles from the PubMed open access subset database. This dataset, publicly available on Zenodo, is the largest keyword extraction benchmark with sufficient samples to train neural networks. Experimental results using state-of-the-art baseline methods illustrate the need for developing automatic keyword extraction methods for biomedical literature.

AB Robust, high-yield integration of nanoscale components such as graphene nanoribbons, nanoparticles, or single-molecules with conventional electronic circuits has proven to be challenging. This difficulty arises because the contacts to these nanoscale devices must be precisely fabricated with angstrom-level resolution to make reliable connections, and at manufacturing scales this cannot be achieved with even the highest-resolution lithographic tools. Here we introduce an approach that circumvents this issue by precisely creating nanometer-scale gaps between metallic carbon electrodes by using a self-aligning, solution-phase process, which allows facile integration with conventional electronic systems with yields approaching 50%. The electrode separation is controlled by covalently binding metallic single-walled carbon nanotube (mCNT) electrodes to individual DNA duplexes to create mCNT-DNA-mCNT nanojunctions, where the gap is precisely matched to the DNA length. These junctions are then integrated with top-down lithographic techniques to create single-molecule circuits that have electronic properties dominated by the DNA in the junction, have reproducible conductance values with low dispersion, and are stable and robust enough to be utilized as active, high-specificity electronic biosensors for dynamic single-molecule detection of specific oligonucleotides, such as those related to the SARS-CoV-2 genome. This scalable approach for high-yield integration of nanometer-scale devices will enable opportunities for manufacturing of hybrid electronic systems for a wide range of applications.

AB We introduce a projected complex Langevin (CL) numerical sampling method-a fictitious Langevin dynamics scheme that uses numerical projection to sample a constrained stationary distribution with highly oscillatory character. Despite the complex-valued degrees of freedom and associated sign problem, the projected CL method succeeds as a natural extension of real-valued projected Langevin processes. In the newly proposed method, complex-valued Lagrange multipliers are determined to enforce constraints to machine precision at each iteration. To illustrate the efficacy of this approach, we adapt the projected CL method to sample coherent state quantum field theories describing interacting Bose gases, which are realized in modern cold-atom experiments. We apply projected CL to two scenarios with holomorphic constraints, namely the canonical and microcanonical ensembles, and we show that projected CL reproduces the correct thermodynamic observables. We further observe improved numerical stability and accuracy at larger time steps when compared to the previous state-of-the-art method for performing constrained CL sampling.

   Secure aggregation; federated learning; uncoded groupwise keys;

AB Secure aggregation, which is a core component of federated learning, aggregates locally trained models from distributed users at a central server. The "secure" nature of such aggregation consists of the fact that no information about the local users' data must be leaked to the server except the aggregated local models. In order to guarantee security, some keys may be shared among the users (this is referred to as the key sharing phase). After the key sharing phase, each user masks its trained model which is then sent to the server (this is referred to as the model aggregation phase). This paper follows the information theoretic secure aggregation problem originally formulated by Zhao and Sun, with the objective to characterize the minimum communication cost from the K users in the model aggregation phase. Due to user dropouts, which are common in real systems, the server may not receive all messages from the users. A secure aggregation scheme should tolerate the dropouts of at most K-U users, where U is a system parameter. The optimal communication cost is characterized by Zhao and Sun, but with the assumption that the keys stored by the users could be any random variables with arbitrary dependency. On the motivation that uncoded groupwise keys are more convenient to be shared and could be used in large range of applications besides federated learning, in this paper we add one constraint into the above problem, namely, that the key variables are mutually independent and each key is shared by a group of S users, where S is another system parameter. To the best of our knowledge, all existing secure aggregation schemes (with information theoretic security or computational security) assign coded keys to the users. We show that if S > K- U , a new secure aggregation scheme with uncoded groupwise keys can achieve the same optimal communication cost as the best scheme with coded keys; if K- U , uncoded groupwise key sharing is strictly sub-optimal. Finally, we also implement our proposed secure aggregation scheme into Amazon EC2, which are then compared with the existing secure aggregation schemes with offline key sharing.

ID INFERENCE; CONVERGENCE; MODELS
AB For multivariate stationary time series many important properties, such as partial correlation, graphical models and autoregressive representations are encoded in the inverse of its spectral density matrix. This is not true for nonstationary time series, where the pertinent information lies in the inverse infinite dimensional covariance matrix operator associated with the multivariate time series. This necessitates the study of the covariance of a multivariate nonstationary time series and its relationship to its inverse. We show that if the rows/columns of the infinite dimensional covariance matrix decay at a certain rate then the rate (up to a factor) transfers to the rows/columns of the inverse covariance matrix. This is used to obtain a nonstationary autoregressive representation of the time series and a Baxter -type bound between the parameters of the autoregressive infinite representation and the corresponding finite autoregressive projection. The aforementioned results lay the foundation for the subsequent analysis of locally stationary time series. In particular, we show that smoothness properties on the covariance matrix transfer to (i) the inverse covariance (ii) the parameters of the vector autoregressive representation and (iii) the partial covariances. All results are set up in such a way that the constants involved depend only on the eigenvalue of the covariance matrix and can be applied in the high -dimensional settings with non -diverging eigenvalues.

AB A key control on the magnitude of coastal eutrophication is the degree to which currents quickly transport nitrogen derived from human sources away from the coast to the open ocean before eutrophication develops. In the Southern California Bight (SCB), an upwelling-dominated eastern boundary current ecosystem, anthropogenic nitrogen inputs increase algal productivity and cause subsurface acidification and oxygen (O 2 \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$_{2}$$\end{document} ) loss along the coast. However, the extent of anthropogenic influence on eutrophication beyond the coastal band, and the physical transport mechanisms and biogeochemical processes responsible for these effects are still poorly understood. Here, we use a submesoscale-resolving numerical model to document the detailed biogeochemical mass balance of nitrogen, carbon and oxygen, their physical transport, and effects on offshore habitats. Despite management of terrestrial nutrients that has occurred in the region over the last 20 years, coastal eutrophication continues to persist.

   reserve; compiler; privacy-preserve machine learning
AB Thanks to the computation ability on encrypted data and the efficient fixed-point execution, the RNS-CKKS fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) scheme is a promising solution for privacy-preserving machine learning services. However, writing an efficient RNS-CKKS program is challenging due to its manual scale management requirement. Each cipher-text has a scale value with its maximum scale capacity. Since each RNS-CKKS multiplication increases the scale, programmers should properly rescale a ciphertext by reducing the scale and capacity together. Existing compilers reduce the programming burden by automatically analyzing and managing the scales of ciphertexts, but they either conservatively rescale ciphertexts and thus give up further optimization opportunities, or require time-consuming scale management space exploration.
   This work proposes a new performance-aware static scale analysis for an RNS-CKKS program, which generates an efficient scale management plan without expensive space exploration. This work analyzes the scale budget, called "reserve", of each ciphertext in a backward manner from the end of a program and redistributes the budgets to the ciphertexts, thus enabling performance-aware scale management. This work also designs a new type system for the proposed scale analysis and ensures the correctness of the analysis result. This work achieves 41.8% performance improvement over EVA that uses conservative static scale analysis. It also shows similar performance improvement to exploration-based Hecate yet with 15526x faster scale management time.

AB This study investigates the transport and deposition of small particles ( 500 nm <= dp <= 10 mu m) in a fully developed turbulent channel flow, focusing on two fluid friction Reynolds numbers: Re tau=180 and Re tau=1000. Using the point particle-direct numerical simulation method under the assumption of one-way coupling, we study how fluid flow (carrier phase) characteristics influence particle deposition. Our findings suggest that changes in flow conditions can significantly alter the deposition behavior of particles with the same size and properties. Furthermore, we show for the first time that gravity has minimal impact on deposition dynamics only at high Reynolds numbers. This research enhances our understanding of small particle deposition and transport in turbulent flows at high Reynolds numbers, which is crucial for various industrial applications.

AB Law school students are encouraged frequently to "network." However, depending on demographic categories, they may have access to differently resourced social networks in law school. In this article, we draw from our mixed-methods research to explore this diversity of experience, its limitations of access, and the possible network inequalities that may limit the value of legal education to diverse students across different institutional contexts. Using survey and network data (N = 744), collected during the fall of 2019 from three law schools, as well as supplementary interview data (N = 55), we examined students' social networks, the structures of these relationships, and their associations with law school satisfaction. We find that, while students tended to cluster based on shared characteristics (that is, race, gender, sexual identity, political orientation, religion, and age) and contexts (that is, type of program, section assignments), these emergent clusters produced disparities in satisfaction across racial categories. Homophilous networks were tied to satisfaction for Black and White students, but the same embeddedness was associated with lower satisfaction with law school for Asian and Latinx students. These results provide grounds for rethinking how diversity matters in law school and its implications for marginalized students' experience and success.

AB Membrane-based gas separations are crucial for an energy-efficient future. However, it is difficult to develop membrane materials that are high-performing, scalable, and processable. Microporous organic polymers (MOPs) combine benefits for gas sieving and solution processability. Herein, we report membrane performance for a new family of microporous poly(arylene ether)s (PAEs) synthesized via Pd-catalyzed C-O coupling reactions. The scaffold of these microporous polymers consists of rigid three-dimensional triptycene and stereocontorted spirobifluorene, endowing these polymers with micropore dimensions attractive for gas separations. This robust PAE synthesis method allows for the facile incorporation of functionalities and branched linkers for control of permeation and mechanical properties. A solution-processable branched polymer was formed into a submicron film and characterized for permeance and selectivity, revealing lab data that rivals property sets of commercially available membranes already optimized for much thinner configurations. Moreover, the branching motif endows these materials with outstanding plasticization resistance, and their microporous structure and stability enables benefits from competitive sorption, increasing CO2/CH4 and (H2S+CO2)/CH4 selectivity in mixture tests as predicted by the dual-mode sorption model. The structural tunability, stability, and ease-of-processing suggest that this new platform of microporous polymers provides generalizable design strategies to form MOPs at scale for demanding gas separations in industry.
   A new class of microporous poly(arylene ether)s (PAEs) with versatile synthetic tunability was synthesized via Pd-catalyzed C-O polycondensation. These PAEs can incorporate diverse functional groups and configurational designs. A PAE with a certain amount of branched linker exhibited excellent performance in CO2/CH4 mixed-gas membrane-based separations and can be fabricated into a submicron thin film to access high flux.**+image

AB In this paper, we present a cosmetic-specific skin image dataset.(1) It consists of skin images from 45 patches (5 skin patches each from 9 participants) of size 8mm*8mm under three cosmetic products (i.e., foundation, blusher, and highlighter). We designed a novel capturing device inspired by LightStage [Debevec et al. 2000]. Using the device, we captured over 600 images of each skin patch under diverse lighting conditions in 30 seconds. We repeated the process for the same skin patch under three cosmetic products. Finally, we demonstrate the viability of the dataset with an image-to-image translation-based pipeline for cosmetic rendering and compared our data-driven approach to an existing cosmetic rendering method [Kim and Ko 2018].

AB Given the widespread use of Python and its sustaining impact, the security and reliability of the Python runtime system is highly and broadly critical. Yet with real-world bugs in Python runtimes being continuously and increasingly reported, technique/tool support for automated detection of such bugs is still largely lacking. In this paper, we present PyRTFuzz, a novel fuzzing technique/tool for holistically testing Python runtimes including the language interpreter and its runtime libraries. PyRTFuzz combines generationand mutation-based fuzzing at the compiler- and application-testing level, respectively, as enabled by static/dynamic analysis for extracting runtime API descriptions, a declarative, specification language for valid and diverse Python code generation, and a custom type-guided mutation strategy for format/structure-aware application input generation. We implemented PyRTFuzz for the primary Python implementation (CPython) and applied it to three versions of the runtime. Our experiments revealed 61 new, demonstrably exploitable bugs including those in the interpreter and most in the runtime libraries. Our results also demonstrated the promising scalability and cost-effectiveness of PyRTFuzz and its great potential for further bug discovery. The two-level collaborative fuzzing methodology instantiated in PyRTFuzz may also apply to other language runtimes especially those of interpreted languages.

AB Exploring the mechanisms underlying the toxicity of amyloid oligomers (AOs) presents a significant opportunity for discovering cures and developing treatments for neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, using a combination of ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry (IMS-MS) and X-ray crystallography (XRC), we showed that the peptide KVKVLWDVIEV, which is the G95W mutant of alpha B-Crystallin (90-100) and abbreviated as G6W, self-assembles up to a dodecamer that structurally resembles lipid transport proteins. The glycine to tryptophan mutation promotes not only larger oligomers and enhanced cytotoxicity in brain slices than the wild type but also a narrow hydrophobic cavity suitable for fatty acid or phospholipid binding. Here, we determine the plausibility of a novel cytotoxic mechanism where the G6W's structural motif could perturb lipid homeostasis by determining its lipid binding selectivity and specificity. We show that the G6W oligomers have a strong affinity toward unsaturated phospholipids with a preference toward phospholipids containing 16-C alkyl chains. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate how an unsaturated, 16-C phospholipid fits tightly inside and outside G6W's hydrophobic cavity. This binding is exclusive to the G6W peptide, as other amyloid oligomers with different atomic structures, including its wildtype alpha B-Crystallin (90-100) and several superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) peptides that are known to self-assemble into amyloid oligomers (SOD1(P28K) and SOD1(WG-GW)), do not experience the same strong binding affinity. While the existing chaperone-lipid hypothesis on amyloid toxicity suggests amyloid-lipid complexes perforate cell membranes, our work provides a new outlook, indicating that soluble amyloid oligomers disrupt lipid homeostasis via selective protein-ligand interactions. The toxic mechanisms may arise from the formation of unique amyloid oligomer structures assisted by lipid ligands or impaired lipid transports.

AB The expansion history and thermal physical process that happened in the early Universe before big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) remains relatively unconstrained by observations. Low reheating temperature universes with normalcy temperatures of TRH similar to 2 MeV remain consistent with primordial nucleosynthesis and accommodate several new physics scenarios that would normally be constrained by high -temperature reheating models, including massive sterile neutrinos. We explore such scenarios' production of keV-scale sterile neutrinos and their resulting constraints from cosmological observations. The parameter space for massive sterile neutrinos is much less constrained than in high -TRH thermal histories, though several cosmological constraints remain. Such parameter space is the target of several current and upcoming laboratory experiments such as TRISTAN (KATRIN), HUNTER, MAGNETO-v, and PTOLEMY. Cosmological constraints remain stringent for stable keV-scale sterile neutrinos. However, we show that sterile neutrinos with a dark decay to radiation through a Z0 or a new scalar are largely unconstrained by cosmology. In addition, this mechanism of sterile neutrinos with large mixing may provide a solution to the Hubble tension. We find that keV-scale sterile neutrinos are therefore one of the best probes of the untested pre-BBN era in the early Universe and could be seen in upcoming laboratory experiments.

AB By using gravity/gauge correspondence, we construct a holographic model, constrained to mimic the lattice QCD equation of state at zero density, to investigate the temperature and baryon chemical potential dependence of the equation of state. We also obtained the energy loss of light and heavy partons within the hot and dense plasma represented by the heavy quark drag force, Langevin diffusion coefficients and jet quenching parameter at the critical point and across the first-order transition line predicted by the model.

TI Time projection chamber for GADGET II
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW C

DT Article
ID NUCLEAR-DATA SHEETS; SYSTEM; DETECTORS
AB Background: The established Gaseous Detector with Germanium Tagging (GADGET) detection system is used to measure weak, low-energy 9-delayed proton decays. It consists of the Gaseous Proton Detector equipped with a MICROMEGAS (MM) readout to detect protons and other charged particles calorimetrically, surrounded by the Segmented Germanium Array (SeGA) for high-resolution detection of prompt gamma rays. Purpose: To upgrade GADGET's Proton Detector to operate as a compact time projection chamber (TPC) for the detection, three-dimensional imaging and identification of low-energy 9-delayed single- and multiparticle emissions mainly of interest to astrophysical studies. Method: A new high granularity MM board with 1024 pads has been designed, fabricated, installed, and tested. A high-density data acquisition system based on generic electronics for TPCs (GET) has been installed and optimized to record and process the gas avalanche signals collected on the readout pads. The TPC's performance has been tested using a 220Rn alpha-particle source and cosmic-ray muons. In addition, decay events in the TPC have been simulated by adapting the ATTPCROOT data analysis framework. Furthermore, a novel application of twodimensional convolutional neural networks for GADGET II event classification is introduced. The optimization of data throughput is also addressed. Results: The GADGET II TPC is capable of detecting and identifying alpha particles as well as measuring their track direction, range, and energy. The extracted energy resolution of the GADGET II TPC using P10 gas is about 5.4% at 6.288 MeV (220Rn alpha events), computed using charge integration. Based on a systematic simulation study, we estimated the detection efficiency of the GADGET II TPC for protons and alpha particles, respectively. It has also been demonstrated that the GADGET II TPC is capable of tracking minimum-ionizing particles (i.e., cosmic-ray muons). From these measurements, the electron drift velocity was measured under typical operating conditions. In addition to being one of the first generation of micropattern gaseous detectors (MPGDs) to utilize a resistive anode applied to low-energy nuclear physics, the GADGET II TPC will also be the first TPC surrounded by a high-efficiency array of high-purity germanium gamma -ray detectors. Conclusions: The TPC of GADGET II has been designed, fabricated, and tested and is ready for operation at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams for radioactive-beam-line experiments.

AB Recent calls have been made for equity tools and frameworks to be integrated throughout the research and design life cycle -from conception to implementation-with an emphasis on reducing inequity in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) applications. Simply stating that equity should be integrated throughout, however, leaves much to be desired as industrial ecology (IE) researchers, practitioners, and decision-makers attempt to employ equitable practices. In this forum piece, we use a critical review approach to explain how socioecological inequities emerge in ML applications across their life cycle stages by leveraging the food system. We exemplify the use of a comprehensive questionnaire to delineate unfair ML bias across data bias, algorithmic bias, and selection and deployment bias categories. Finally, we provide consolidated guidance and tailored strategies to help address AI/ML unfair bias and inequity in IE applications. Specifically, the guidance and tools help to address sensitivity, reliability, and uncertainty challenges. There is also discussion on how bias and inequity in AI/ML affect other IE research and design domains, besides the food system-such as living labs and circularity. We conclude with an explanation of the future directions IE should take to address unfair bias and inequity in AI/ML. Last, we call for systemic equity to be embedded throughout IE applications to fundamentally understand domain-specific socioecological inequities, identify potential unfairness in ML, and select mitigation strategies in a manner that translates across different research domains.

AB Rate retardation is a common and unusual feature of reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT) polymerization, where a decline in polymerization rate occurs with higher concentrations of the chain transfer agent (CTA). The strength of retardation depends on the RAFT equilibrium constant between the RAFT intermediate radical and the propagating radical plus CTA. Rate retardation occurs for both the more activated monomers (MAMs) and the less activated monomers (LAMs). Herein, we exploit the ubiquitous phenomenon of RAFT rate retardation to identify the unique RAFT kinetics of MAMs: methyl methacrylate, styrene, phenyl vinyl ketone, methyl acrylate, and dimethyl acrylamide, as well as LAMs: vinyl acetate and N-vinyl pyrrolidone. Investigating the above monomers indicates that LAMs and acrylic/acrylamide monomers show substantial retardation, even using optimized conditions targeting polymers of over a degree of polymerization near 1000. In contrast, highly activated monomers such as styrene, methyl methacrylate, and phenyl vinyl ketone showed only weak retardation under their optimized conditions at near a target degree of polymerization of 300. The analysis indicates that even within the MAM family, there exist differences in monomer reactivity, with acrylic/acrylamide monomers having lower reactivity and higher propensity for retardation, than methacrylic, vinyl ketone, or styrene monomers. The current study highlights how retardation kinetics in RAFT can be used to extract general trends in monomer reactivity and radical stabilization that can be employed to pre-plan polymerization outcomes.
   The RAFT rate retardation effect is used to classify monomers according to their reactivity. The stability of the radical correlates inversely with the extent of retardation allowing a framework for classifying monomer reactivity to be established.

AB In September 2020, Western North America was impacted by a highly anomalous meteorological event. Over the Pacific Northwest, strong and dry easterly winds exceeded historically observed values for the time of year and contributed to the rapid spread of several large wildfires. Nine lives were lost and over 5000 homes and businesses were destroyed in Oregon. The smoke from the fires enveloped the region for nearly two weeks after the event. Concurrently, the same weather system brought record-breaking cold, dramatic 24-h temperature falls, and early-season snowfall to parts of the Rocky Mountains. Here we use synoptic analysis and air parcel backward trajectories to build a process-based understanding of this extreme event and to put it in a climatological context. The primary atmospheric driver was the rapid development of a highly amplified 500 hPa tropospheric wave pattern that persisted for several days. A record-breaking ridge of high pressure characterized the western side of the wave pattern with a record-breaking trough of low pressure to the east. A notable anticyclonic Rossby wave breaking event occurred as the wave train amplified. Air parcel backward trajectories show that dry air over the Pacific Northwest, which exacerbated the fire danger, originated in the mid-troposphere and descended through subsidence to the surface. At the same time, dramatic temperature falls were recorded along the east side of the Rocky Mountains, driven by strong transport of high-latitude air near the surface.

AB Uncrewed air vehicles in urban environments will have flights during terminal operations that are dominated by strong transient aerodynamics. These vehicles are not only lighter and smaller than traditional rotorcraft and helicopters, but in many instances they may be hybrid configurations with lifting surfaces similar to those of fixed-wing aircraft. These differences require further understanding of the physics of these transient aerodynamics, specifically large-amplitude transverse gusts and the resulting vehicle response, where classic indicial theory is no longer valid. This is crucial to the safety and certification of these air vehicles near buildings and populations. Prior efforts identified that gust responses depart from traditional linear theory when the leading-edge vortex (LEV) forms as a distinct feature and departs from the lifting surface, resulting in flow nonlinearities. This paper expands our understanding of the interactional physics of these nonlinear transverse gusts with flow separation. LEV and trailing-edge vortex (TEV) behavior are correlated, and these vortex interactions are studied to understand the impact on flow separation and subsequent aerodynamic behavior. Larger gust ratios are observed to increase the LEV normal translation, while flow separation is driven by the location and magnitude of the TEV.

AB Bacterial cells are covered by a complex carbohydrate coat of armor that allows bacteria to thrive in a range of environments. As a testament to the importance of bacterial glycans, effective and heavily utilized antibiotics including penicillin and vancomycin target and disrupt the bacterial glycocalyx. Despite their importance, the study of bacterial glycans lags far behind their eukaryotic counterparts. Bacterial cells use a large palette of monosaccharides to craft glycans, leading to molecules that are significantly more complex than eukaryotic glycans and that are refractory to study. Fortunately, chemical tools designed to probe bacterial glycans have yielded insights into these molecules, their structures, their biosynthesis, and their functions.

AB Mutations in the tyrosine phosphatase Src homology- 2 domain- containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-2 (SHP2) are associated with a variety of human diseases. Most mutations in SHP2 increase its basal catalytic activity by disrupting autoinhibitory interactions between its phosphatase domain and N- terminal SH2 (phosphotyrosine recognition) domain. By contrast, some disease- associated mutations located in the ligand- binding pockets of the N- or C- terminal SH2 domains do not increase basal activity and likely exert their pathogenicity through alternative mechanisms. We lack a molecular understanding of how these SH2 mutations impact SHP2 structure, activity, and signaling. Here, we characterize five SHP2 SH2 domain ligand- binding pocket mutants through a combination of high- throughput biochemical screens, biophysical and biochemical measurements, and molecular dynamics simulations. We show that while some of these mutations alter binding affinity to phosphorylation sites, the T42A mutation in the N-SH2 domain is unique in that it also substantially alters ligand- binding specificity, despite being 8 to 10 & Aring; from the specificity- determining region of the SH2 domain. This mutation exerts its effect on sequence specificity by remodeling the phosphotyrosine- binding pocket, altering the mode of engagement of both the phosphotyrosine and surrounding residues on the ligand. The functional consequence of this altered specificity is that the T42A mutant has biased sensitivity toward a subset of activating ligands and enhances downstream signaling. Our study highlights an example of a nuanced mechanism of action for a disease- associated mutation, characterized by a change in protein-protein interaction specificity that alters enzyme activation.

SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE

AB The goal of this work was to create shape memory polymer blends for the additive manufacturing technology of fused filament fabrication. An iterative approach was taken to develop a binary blend of polycaprolactone (PCL) and thermoplastic urethane (TPU). The composition of equal parts by mass PCL and TPU exhibited the best mechanical and shape memory properties. It was then decided to compound a ternary blend of PCL, TPU, and polylactic acid (PLA) where all components were of equal parts by mass. Constituents were chosen because they are all long chain polyesters with similar Hildebrand solubility parameters, because they are biocompatible, and because they all have some level of shape memory properties on their own. Dynamic mechanical analysis was performed to determine the recovery temperature for specimens that were deformed at room temperature. Scanning electron microscopy was used to perform fracture surface analysis of spent tensile test specimens. X-ray diffraction was used to explore aspects related to crystallinity of the blend materials. Transmission electron microscopy was used to characterize the mixing of the blend constituents where both the binary and ternary blends were found to be immiscible. The work presented here demonstrates materials selection based on structure, polymer family, and solubility parameter as a strategy for the development of multi-constituent polymer blends without the use of compatibilizers.

   monitoring; mHealth; privacy
ID RATING-SCALE
AB Background: The proliferation of mobile health (mHealth) applications is partly driven by the advancements in sensing and communication technologies, as well as the integration of artificial intelligence techniques. Data collected from mHealth applications, for example, on sensor devices carried by patients, can be mined and analyzed using artificial intelligence-based solutions to facilitate remote and (near) real-time decision-making in health care settings. However, such data often sit in data silos, and patients are often concerned about the privacy implications of sharing their raw data. Federated learning (FL) is a potential solution, as it allows multiple data owners to collaboratively train a machine learning model without requiring access to each other's raw data.
   Objective: The goal of this scoping review is to gain an understanding of FL and its potential in dealing with sensitive and heterogeneous data in mHealth applications. Through this review, various stakeholders, such as health care providers, practitioners, and policy makers, can gain insight into the limitations and challenges associated with using FL in mHealth and make informed decisions when considering implementing FL-based solutions.
   Methods: We conducted a scoping review following the guidelines of PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews). We searched 7 commonly used databases. The included studies were analyzed and summarized to identify the possible real-world applications and associated challenges of using FL in mHealth settings.
   Results: A total of 1095 articles were retrieved during the database search, and 26 articles that met the inclusion criteria were included in the review. The analysis of these articles revealed 2 main application areas for FL in mHealth, that is, remote monitoring and diagnostic and treatment support. More specifically, FL was found to be commonly used for monitoring self-care ability, health status, and disease progression, as well as in diagnosis and treatment support of diseases. The review also identified several challenges (eg, expensive communication, statistical heterogeneity, and system heterogeneity) and potential solutions (eg, compression schemes, model personalization, and active sampling).
   Conclusions: This scoping review has highlighted the potential of FL as a privacy-preserving approach in mHealth applications and identified the technical limitations associated with its use. The challenges and opportunities outlined in this review can inform the research agenda for future studies in this field, to overcome these limitations and further advance the use of FL in mHealth.

AB Molecular doping can increase the conductivity of organic semiconductors and plays an increasingly important role in emerging and established plastic electronics applications. 4-(1,3-Dimethyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)-N,N-dimethylaniline (N-DMBI-H) and tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (BCF) are established n- and p-dopants, respectively, but neither functions as a simple one-electron redox agent. Molecular hydrogen has been suggested to be a byproduct in several proposed mechanisms for doping using both N-DMBI-H and BCF. In this paper we show for the first time the direct detection of molecular hydrogen in the uncatalysed doping of a variety of polymeric and molecular semiconductors using these dopants. Our results provide insight into the doping mechanism, providing information complementary to that obtained from more commonly applied methods such as optical, electron spin resonance, and electrical measurements.

AB The sensitivity of the fluorescence properties of n-cyanoindole (n-CNI) fluorescent probes to the microenvironment makes them potential reporters of protein conformation and hydration. The fluorescence intensity of 5-CNI, 6-CNI, and 7-CNI is quenched when exposed to water solvent whereas substitution on position 4 of indoles dramatically increases it. A potential mechanism for this sensitivity to water may be similar to that found in indole. The fluorescence of indole is found to be quenched when interacting with water and ammonia solvent molecules via radiationless decay through an S-1 (pi sigma*)/S-0 conical intersection caused by excited state proton or hydrogen transfer to the solvent molecules. In this study we examine this fluorescence quenching mechanism along the N-H bond stretch of n-CNI probes using water cluster models and quantum mechanical calculations of the excited states. We find that n-CNI-(H2O)(1-2) clusters form cyclic or non-cyclic structures via hydrogen bonds which lead to different photochemical reaction paths that can potentially quench the fluorescence by undergoing internal conversion from S-1 to S-0. However, the existence of a high energy barrier along the potential energy surface of the S-1 state in most cases prevents this from occurring. We show that substitution on position 4 leads to the highest energy barrier that prevents the fluorophore from accessing these non-radiative channels, in agreement with its high intensity. We also find that the energy barrier in the S-1 state of non-cyclic 5-CNI-(H2O)(1-2) excited complexes decreases as the number of water molecules increases, which suggests great sensitivity of the fluorescence quenching on the aqueous environment.

AB The traditional goal in remote tracking of a dynamic source is to keep the current estimate at the destination as close as possible to the true state. However, in domains such as surveillance applications, the destination is also interested in reconstructing the past trajectory of states for further processing. This requires striking a balance between providing current versus past state information so that the destination can optimize the trade-off between the metrics of freshness and reconstruction queue length. In this work, we propose a randomized update policy that decides between head-of-line versus tail-of-line packets in the update queue. As such, our policy combines the strength of Last-Come-First-Serve (LCFS) service discipline (which aims at reducing the age) with the strength of First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) service discipline (which aims at reducing the reconstruction delay). We evaluate the performance of our proposed policy in terms of its randomization parameter, which can be optimized given the system parameters to achieve a better trade-off.

AB An increasing number of applications running on an edge device use Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to process sensor data and return inference results to make certain decisions. Thus, one research problem is: for a group of DNN inference jobs to run on an edge device, how to determine the job configuration (i.e., the DNN structure, the number of cores, the amount of resource in each core) for each job, so that each job's deadline and accuracy requirements are satisfied and the overall average job latency and accuracy performances are maximized? However, there has been no previous research for this problem. Prior approaches only focus on selecting or generating a model structure for a single DNN inference job on an edge device, or on deciding the structure and computation resource allocation of each job in running jobs (instead of fine-grained decisions on the number of cores and the amount of resources in each core). It is a challenge to coordinate the high-level fine-grained resource scheduling and low-level structure selection among the jobs to achieve the goal. To handle this challenge, in this paper, we first conduct analysis experiments on CPU, GPU, and TPU devices, which show the importance of coordinately selecting structures for different jobs to avoid resource contention, enabling jobs to share resources to increase resource utilization, and selecting the best job configuration to minimize inference time. Based on these, we propose a system that Elastically Schedules Multiple DNN Inference jobs on an edge device for high efficiency and accuracy (ESIM). ESIM uses both heuristic and RL algorithms to find the problem solution. Both container-based emulation and real experiments on CPU, GPU and TPU devices show that ESIM achieves improvement of up to 35% in average inference time, up to 14% in average accuracy, up to 33% in timeliness guarantee ratio, and up to 27% in accuracy guarantee ratio compared to the state-of-theart approaches.

AB Dihalotriorganopnictoranes serve as important synthetic precursors in Group 15 chemistry, but the influence of the organic substituents on the synthesis and reactivity of these compounds remains underexplored for the heavy pnictogens. We recently reported the isolation of Dipp3Sb (Dipp = 2,6-diisopropylphenyl). The bulky Dipp substituents permit the isolation of monomeric tetrahedral stibine oxide Dipp3SbO, yet also allow for the formation of the trigonal bipyramidal Dipp3SbF2. We now report the isolation of a sterically crowded bismuthine, Dipp3Bi. Reaction between Dipp3Bi and XeF2 afforded Dipp3BiF2, which features a distorted trigonal bipyramidal geometry in the solid state. Reaction between Dipp3Bi and PhICl2 resulted in the generation of 1-chloro-2,6-diisopropylbenzene. Reaction between Dipp3Sb and PhICl2 resulted in the formation of Dipp3SbCl2, which features a square pyramidal geometry in the solid state. Mes3SbCl2, Mes3SbBr2, Mes3BiCl2, and Mes3BiBr2 (Mes = mesityl) were structurally characterized and all exhibit trigonal bipyramidal geometries in the solid state. Solution-phase spectroscopic measurements reflect the fluxionality of all of these molecules, but theoretical analyses in the gas phase suggest that the square pyramidal geometry of Dipp3SbCl2 is more thermodynamically favorable than the trigonal bipyramidal geometry, possibly due to the presence of intramolecular secondary interactions between the Dipp and Cl substituents. These results highlight the ability of Dipp substituents to alter reactivity pathways of heavy pnictines.

AB Online social network (OSN) privacy leakage problem addresses more and more users' concerns. Studying the problem from attackers' view could tell us how to prevent further data leakage. Currently, attackers mainly focus on mapping identities between their background knowledge and the published data to collect useful information. However, it becomes difficult to find the global optimal mapping strategy because of the complexity of the OSN data. This article proposes a novel generating-based attack on OSN data, no longer restricted to mapping-based information collection. Generally, the proposed scheme learns OSN properties from the attackers' background knowledge and employs the knowledge to fill the unknown area in the published data. The proposed scheme employs a generative adversarial network to ensure the similarity between the generated graph and the published data. The conditional information is also added in the generation process such that the generated graph is restricted to the conditions under attackers' background knowledge. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme successfully infer private information with real-world OSN datasets.

AB There are numerous reports of photo(electro)catalysts demonstrating activity for nitrogen reduction to ammonia and a few reports of photo(electro)catalysts demonstrating activity for nitrogen oxidation to nitric acid. However, progress in advancing solar-to-fertilizer applications is slow, due in part to the pace of catalyst screening. Most evaluations of photo(electro)catalysts activity occur using batch reactors. This is because common product analyses require accumulation of ammonia or nitric acid in the reactor to overcome instrument detection limits. The primary aim here is to examine the use of an electroanalytical method, rotating ring disk electrode voltammetry (RRDE), to detect ammonia produced by a nitrogen fixing photo(electro)catalyst. To examine the potential for RRDE, we investigated a photo(electro)catalyst known to reduce nitrogen to ammonia (titania), while varying the applied electrochemical potential and degree of illumination on the disk. We show that the observed ammonia oxidation at the ring electrode corresponds strongly with ammonia measurements obtained from the bulk electrolyte. Indicating that RRDE may be effective for catalyst screening. The chief limitation of this approach is the need for an alkaline electrolyte. In addition, this approach does not rule out the presence of adventitious ammonia.

AB Academic fields exhibit substantial levels of gender segregation. Here, we investigated differences in field-specific ability beliefs (FABs) as an explanation for this phenomenon. FABs may contribute to gender segregation to the extent that they portray success as depending on "brilliance" (i.e., exceptional intellectual ability), which is a trait culturally associated with men more than women. Although prior work has documented a relation between academic fields' FABs and their gender composition, it is still unclear what the underlying dynamics are that give rise to gender imbalances across academia as a function of FABs. To provide insight into this issue, we custom-built a new data set by combining information from the author-tracking service Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID) with information from a survey of U.S. academics across 30 fields. Using this expansive longitudinal data set (Ns = 86,879-364,355), we found that women were underrepresented among those who enter fields with brilliance-oriented FABs and overrepresented among those who exit these fields. We also found that FABs' association with women's transitions across academic fields was substantially stronger than their association with men's transitions. With respect to mechanisms, FABs' association with gender segregation was partially explained by the fact that women encounter more prejudice in fields with brilliance-oriented FABs. With its focus on the dynamic patterns shaping segregation and its broad scope in terms of geography, career stage, and historical time, this research makes an important contribution toward understanding the factors driving gender segregation in academia.

AB Machine learning (ML) algorithms have produced remarkable advances in streamflow prediction, exceeding the performance of calibrated conceptual and physics-based hydrological models that have been developed over many decades. ML algorithms seem to overcome the issue of errors known to be present in rainfall and streamflow estimates that have hindered the performance of hydrological models for decades. In this paper, we propose a methodology for testing and benchmarking ML algorithms using artificial data generated by physically-based hydrological models. Our approach makes it possible to design controlled numerical experiments that can improve our understanding of this new generation of black-box models. We conducted a diagnostics study to demonstrate our methodology in which we attempted to determine if ML algorithms can identify a function relating streamflow and rainfall. This exercise combined the implementation of the distributed hillslope-link hydrological model (HLM) on a 4,385 km2 basin driven by precipitation fields created using the stochastic storm transposition (SST) framework, and an advanced deep learning algorithm based on gated recurrent unit (GRU)-Attention neural networks. The data generated allowed us to create prediction scenarios that are equivalent to the hindcast and real-time forecast problems. We proposed a set of scale-independent performance metrics to evaluate the results of our experiment and found that the GRU can correctly identify a predictive function for all analyzed locations in the river network. We concluded that under the circumstances tested in this study, deep learning can identify the transformation function when trained in Hindcast Mode, making it a powerful tool to determine the streamflow response of a basin to predetermined rainfall scenarios. However, it fails to significantly outperform the predictions of temporal persistence when tested in Forecast Mode.

AB The connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV) applications and services-based traffic make an extra burden on the already congested cellular networks. Offloading is envisioned as a promising solution to tackle cellular networks' traffic explosion problem. Notably, vehicular traffic offloading leveraging different vehicular communication network (VCN) modes is one of the potential techniques to address the data traffic problem in cellular networks. This paper surveys the state-of-the-art literature for vehicular data offloading under a communication perspective, i.e., vehicle to vehicle (V2V), vehicle to roadside infrastructure (V2I), and vehicle to everything (V2X). First, we pinpoint the significant classification of vehicular data/traffic offloading techniques, considering whether data is to download or upload. Next, for better intuition of each data offloading's category, we sub-classify the existing schemes based on their objectives. Then, the existing literature on vehicular data/traffic is elaborated, compared, and analyzed based on approaches, objectives, merits, demerits, etc. Finally, we highlight the open research challenges in this field and predict future research trends.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Quantum linear system algorithms (QLSAs) have the potential to speed up algorithms that rely on solving linear systems. Interior point methods (IPMs) yield a fundamental family of polynomial-time algorithms for solving optimization problems. IPMs solve a Newton linear system at each iteration to compute the search direction; thus, QLSAs can potentially speed up IPMs. Due to the noise in contemporary quantum computers, quantum-assisted IPMs (QIPMs) only admit an inexact solution to the Newton linear system. Typically, an inexact search direction leads to an infeasible solution, so, to overcome this, we propose an inexact-feasible QIPM (IF-QIPM) for solving linearly constrained quadratic optimization problems. We also apply the algorithm to (1)-norm pound soft margin support vector machine (SVM) problems, and demonstrate that our algorithm enjoys a speedup in the dimension over existing approaches. This complexity bound is better than any existing classical or quantum algorithm that produces a classical solution.

AB We present Prompt Diffusion, a framework for enabling in-context learning in diffusion-based generative models. Given a pair of task-specific example images, such as depth from/to image and scribble from/to image, and a text guidance, our model automatically understands the underlying task and performs the same task on a new query image following the text guidance. To achieve this, we propose a vision-language prompt that can model a wide range of vision-language tasks and a diffusion model that takes it as input. The diffusion model is trained jointly on six different tasks using these prompts. The resulting Prompt Diffusion model becomes the first diffusion-based vision-language foundation model capable of in-context learning. It demonstrates high-quality in-context generation for the trained tasks and effectively generalizes to new, unseen vision tasks using their respective prompts. Our model also shows compelling text-guided image editing results. Our framework aims to facilitate research into in-context learning for computer vision. We share our code and pre-trained models at https://github.com/Zhendong-Wang/Prompt-Diffusion.

TI Stability of Frank-Kasper Phases in AB<sub> <i>n</i> </sub> Miktoarm
   Star Polymers with Dispersity in <i>n</i>: Simulations and Experiments
SO MACROMOLECULES
LA English
DT Article
ID BLOCK-COPOLYMER; TRANSITION; SOLVENTS
AB Miktoarm star polymers with two or more blocks connected at a common junction are known to stabilize Frank-Kasper phases such as sigma and A15 over wide regions of phase space due to arm-number asymmetry. To date, studies on AB n miktoarm stars in this context have focused on well-defined materials with a precise number of A and B arms. Here, using a combination of self-consistent field theory simulations and experiments, we demonstrate that mixtures of AB n miktoarm stars with dispersity in the number of B arms per molecule (n) similarly stabilize sigma and A15. This insight highlights the utility of a synthetic technique known as mu STAR (miktoarm synthesis by termination after ring-opening metathesis polymerization) that simplifies the synthesis of miktoarm star polymers but inherently produces a mixture of AB n molecules having a distribution in n.

TI Pluripotency of a founding field: rebranding developmental biology
SO DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The field of developmental biology has declined in prominence in recent decades, with off-shoots from the field becoming more fashionable and highly funded. This has created inequity in discovery and opportunity, partly due to the perception that the field is antiquated or not cutting edge. A 'think tank'of scientists from multiple developmental biology-related disciplines came together to define specific challenges in the field that may have inhibited innovation, and to provide tangible solutions to some of the issues facing developmental biology. The community suggestions include a call to the community to help 'rebrand' the field, alongside proposals for additional funding apparatuses, frameworks for interdisciplinary innovative collaborations, pedagogical access, improved science communication, increased diversity and inclusion, and equity of resources to provide maximal impact to the community.

AB Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) with mechanical strength and reduced flammability may also enable next-generation Li+ batteries with higher energy densities. However, conventional SPEs have fundamental limitations in terms of Li+ conductivity. While an imidazole functionalized polymer (PMS-Im) has been previously shown to have ionic conductivity related to the imidazole-Li+ coordination, herein we demonstrate that quaternization of this polymer to form an analogous imidazolium functionalized polymer (PMS-Im+) more efficiently solvates lithium salts and plasticizes the polymer. In addition, inverse Haven ratios as high as 10 indicate positively correlated Li+ transport, possibly due to percolation of nanochannels that significantly improve battery-relevant conductivity. From these combined effects, Li+ conductivity in PMS-Im+ (2.1 x 10-5 S/cm) is over an order of magnitude greater than in PMS-Im at 90 degrees C (1.6 x 10-6 S/cm).

TI Controlling Silicification on DNA Origami with Polynucleotide Brushes
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
ID FOLDING DNA; GROWTH; NANOSTRUCTURES; ARRAYS
AB DNA origami has been used as biotemplates for growing a range of inorganic materials to create novel organic-inorganic hybrid nanomaterials. Recently, the solution-based silicification of DNA has been used to grow thin silica shells on DNA origami. However, the silicification reaction is sensitive to the reaction conditions and often results in uncontrolled DNA origami aggregation, especially when growth of thicker silica layers is desired. Here, we investigated how site-specifically placed polynucleotide brushes influence the silicification of DNA origami. Our experiments showed that long DNA brushes, in the form of single- or double-stranded DNA, significantly suppress the aggregation of DNA origami during the silicification process. Furthermore, we found that double-stranded DNA brushes selectively promote silica growth on DNA origami surfaces. These observations were supported and explained by coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. This work provides new insights into our understanding of the silicification process on DNA and provides a powerful toolset for the development of novel DNA-based organic-inorganic nanomaterials.

AB In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for solving convex-concave saddle-point problems using regret minimization in the repeated game framework. To do so, we introduce the Conic Blackwell Algorithm+ (CBA+), a new parameter- and scale-free regret minimizer for general convex compact sets. CBA+ is based on Blackwell approachability and attains O( T ) regret. We show how to efficiently instantiate CBA+ for many decision sets of interest, including the simplex, lp norm balls, and ellipsoidal confidence regions in the simplex. Based on CBA+, we introduce SP-CBA+, a new parameter-free algorithm for solving convex-concave saddle-point problems achieving a O(1= T ) ergodic convergence rate. In our simulations, we demonstrate the wide applicability of SP-CBA+ on several standard saddle-point problems from the optimization and operations research literature, including matrix games, extensiveform games, distributionally robust logistic regression, and Markov decision processes. In each setting, SP-CBA+ achieves state-of-the-art numerical performance and outperforms classical methods, without the need for any choice of step sizes or other algorithmic parameters.

The rational design of mechanophores enables the controlled use of force to achieve constructive molecular reactivity and material responses. While a variety of mechanophores have been developed, this Mini Review focuses on cyclobutane, which has brought valuable insights into molecular reactivity and dynamics as well as innovations in materials. We discuss its reactivity and mechanism, dynamics and stereoselectivity, as well as impacts on material properties.

AB Anthropogenic activities have disrupted the natural nitrogen cycle, increasing the level of nitrogen contaminants in water. Nitrogen contaminants are harmful to humans and the environment. This motivates research on advanced and decarbonized treatment technologies that are capable of removing or valorizing nitrogen waste found in water. In this context, the electrocatalytic conversion of inorganic- and organic-based nitrogen compounds has emerged as an important approach that is capable of upconverting waste nitrogen into valuable compounds. This approach differs from state-of-the-art wastewater treatment, which primarily converts inorganic nitrogen to dinitrogen, and organic nitrogen is sent to landfills. Here, we review recent efforts related to electrocatalytic conversion of inorganic- and organic-based nitrogen waste. Specifically, we detail the role that electrocatalyst design (alloys, defects, morphology, and faceting) plays in the promotion of high-activity and high-selectivity electrocatalysts. We also discuss the impact of wastewater constituents. Finally, we discuss the critical product analyses required to ensure that the reported performance is accurate.

AB The environment, science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics fields (a collection of fields we call E-STEAM) continue to grow and remain economically and ecologically important. However, historically excluded groups remain underrepresented in science and technology professions, particularly in environmental and digital media fields. Consequently, building pathways for historically excluded students to enter economically viable and ecologically influential E-STEAM professions is critically important. These new pathways hold promise for increasing innovation within these fields and ensuring a multiplicity of representation as these fields are shaped and reshaped to attend to the plural interests of diverse communities. Consequently, this conceptual paper describes an eco-digital storytelling (EDS) approach to engaging historically excluded populations in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). This approach offers structured learning opportunities connected to learner interests and community needs with the aim of increasing E-STEAM identity and career interest of teens from groups historically excluded from E-STEAM fields. E-STEAM identity is a meaning one can attach to oneself or that can be ascribed externally by others as individuals interact and engage in E-STEAM fields in ways that foreground the environment. The EDS approach leverages community-based action, technology and digital media, and arts and storytelling as entry points for engaging learners. EDS is designed to increase teens' content knowledge within multiple E-STEAM fields and to provide numerous technology-rich experiences in both application of geospatial technologies (i.e., GPS, interactive maps) and digital media creation (i.e., video, animation, ArcGIS StoryMaps) as a way to shape teens' cultural learning pathways. Examples of rich digital media presentations developed to communicate the EDS approach and local environmental opportunities, challenges, and projects are provided that exemplify how both participation in and communication of environmental action can contribute to more promising and sustainable futures.

AB Membrane-based technologies for gas separation and capture are promising low-energy alternatives to the most common energy-consuming processes such as distillation and absorption. In this frame, porous polymers are attracting considerable interest, but issues related to a trade-off between permeability and selectivity as well as to the long-term stability of the membrane performances need to be overcome. To this end, the study of local dynamics is crucial as it directly correlates with the transport and separation characteristics of polymer-based membranes while also shedding light on plasticization and physical aging phenomena. This work presents a comprehensive characterization of the dynamic properties of a triptycene-based porous polymer with potential application in membrane-based gas separation technology by means of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and solid-state NMR (SSNMR). The investigated polymer has triptycene-based structural repeating units bearing t-butyl groups that are connected by perfluorinated biphenyl repeats. The combination of different SSNMR variable temperature experiments including measurements of 1H, 13C, and 19F spin-spin and spin-lattice relaxation times, 1H-13C and 19F-13C dipolar chemical shift correlation experiments, and 2H experiments provided selective and detailed information on the molecular motions involving the t-butyl, triptycene, and perfluorinated biphenyl groups. A synergistic analysis of the acquired data, employing theoretical dynamic models and comparisons with MD simulations and calculated potential energy scans (PES), has enabled the determination of motion parameters, including activation energies and correlation times. This approach also yielded insights into the motion amplitudes and geometry. These findings can be valuable for future research aimed at elucidating the molecular origins of membrane performance, not only for the polymer under investigation but also for similar polymer-based membranes.

AB Student mindset beliefs about the malleability of intelligence have been linked to student outcomes. However, recent meta-analyses showed mixed findings on how student mindset impacts their outcomes depending on the environment and context, such as the mindset that the instructor projects in the classroom. The current work utilizes Social Cognitive Theory to elucidate the relationship among student perceptions of faculty mindset, affective factors (belonging, self-efficacy, and utility value), and behavioral factors (course grade) using a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) lens within the chemistry context at a demographically diverse institution. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) path analysis revealed that student perceptions of the instructor mindset did not directly predict chemistry course grades. However, a significant indirect effect, mediated by students' sense of academic misfit, was detected. The more students perceived instructors to endorse a fixed mindset, the more academic misfits they reported in their courses, which led to lower chemistry grades. ACT math scores (indicators of prior preparation) unsurprisingly had significant direct and indirect impact on chemistry course grades. Additionally, multigroup moderation analysis revealed that regression pathways did not differ based on race, gender, or age group. While this work highlights the benefit of instructors promoting a healthy learning environment that projects a growth mindset to students, this must be coupled with institutional support to help build foundational knowledge to prepare students for the rigor of chemistry courses and increase the chance of success for all students.

AB PurposeThis paper aims to explore the epistemic connections between three instructional coaches and a first-year in-service teacher during remote planning and debrief meetings. Prior evidence suggests that remote instructional coaching leads to better teaching practices and identifies the instructional coaching moves used to prompt teacher reflection.Design/methodology/approachIn this study, the authors utilized quantitative ethnography and epistemic network analysis (ENA) approaches to explore the epistemic frames of three remote university-based instructional coaches as they supported a first-year in-service teacher.FindingsQuantitative ENA findings shed light on the network connections between instructional coaches and teachers, as well as the epistemic frames observed during planning and debrief meetings. Additionally, the authors provide qualitative findings that complement and reinforce the quantitative results.Research limitations/implicationsAll data collection occurred via Zoom, and the class was in a hybrid modality, with some students attending class in person and some attending remotely via Zoom. This unique context could have impacted the epistemic connections surrounding technology and logistics.Practical implicationsThis study provides a practical codebook for use in future studies that explores instructional coaching. Findings from this study can be used to inform instructional coaching decisions.Originality/valueThe ENA findings helped deepen the authors' understanding of how instructional coaches can support a first-year in-service teacher during planning and debrief meetings in several ways. Additionally, this study presents a unique context given the COVID-19 pandemic and the remote model of instructional coaching.

AB Within "mainstream" developmental science, gender researchers largely study the developmental trajectory of children considered to be "gender typical," while research housed primarily in psychiatry and clinical psychology often documents the trajectories of gender diverse children. This article aims to bridge the studies of gender diversity and "mainstream" gender development. First, we review literature on the development of four commonly studied subgroups of gender diverse children-children referred to medical clinics because of their gender identity and expression, transgender children, female children with congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and tomboys- highlighting how these gender trajectories do or do not align with modal developmental patterns. We then describe social, cognitive, and biological determinants of gender in light of their implications for understanding diverse gender development. Finally, we note methodological suggestions for future research, with an eye toward better integrating research on gender diversity into "mainstream" gender development research.

AB Predicting protein-peptide interactions is crucial for understanding peptide binding processes and designing peptide drugs. However, traditional computational modeling approaches face challenges in accurately predicting peptide-protein binding structures due to the slow dynamics and high flexibility of the peptides. Here, we introduce a new workflow termed "PepBinding" for predicting peptide binding structures, which combines peptide docking, all-atom enhanced sampling simulations using the Peptide Gaussian accelerated Molecular Dynamics (Pep-GaMD) method, and structural clustering. PepBinding has been demonstrated on seven distinct model peptides. In peptide docking using HPEPDOCK, the peptide backbone root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) of their bound conformations relative to X-ray structures ranged from 3.8 to 16.0 & Aring;, corresponding to the medium to inaccurate quality models according to the Critical Assessment of PRediction of Interactions (CAPRI) criteria. The Pep-GaMD simulations performed for only 200 ns significantly improved the docking models, resulting in five medium and two acceptable quality models. Therefore, PepBinding is an efficient workflow for predicting peptide binding structures and is publicly available at https://github.com/MiaoLab20/PepBinding.

TI Indirect Exchange Interaction Leads to Large Lattice Contribution to
   Magnetocaloric Entropy Change
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
ID THERMAL-CONDUCTIVITY; SPIN DYNAMICS; GADOLINIUM
AB Materials with a large magnetocaloric response are highly desirable for magnetic cooling applications. It is suggested that a strong spin-lattice coupling tends to generate a large magnetocaloric effect, but no microscopic mechanism has been proposed. In this Letter, we use spin-lattice dynamics simulation to examine the lattice contribution to the magnetocaloric entropy change in bcc iron (Fe) and hcp gadolinium (Gd) with exchange interaction parameters determined from ab initio calculations. We find that indirect Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) exchange interaction in hcp Gd leads to longer-range spin -lattice coupling and more strongly influences the low-frequency long-wavelength phonons. This results in a higher lattice contribution toward the total magnetocaloric entropy change as compared to bcc Fe with short-range direct exchange interactions. Our analysis provides a framework for understanding the magnetocaloric effect in magnetic materials with strong spin-lattice couplings. Our finding suggests that long-range indirect RKKY-type exchange gives rise to a larger lattice contribution to the magnetocaloric entropy change and is, thus, beneficial for magnetocaloric materials.

TI TIE-GCM ROPE - Dimensionality Reduction: Part I
SO SPACE WEATHER-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
ID GENERAL-CIRCULATION MODEL; DENSITY; CALIBRATION; ATMOSPHERE
AB Physics-based models of the ionosphere-thermosphere system have been touted as the next big thing in the context of drag modeling and space operations for decades. However, the computational complexity of such models have primarily kept them being used operationally. We recently demonstrated a proof-of-concept for developing what we call a reduced order probabilistic emulator (ROPE) for the thermosphere using the thermosphere ionosphere electrodynamics - general circulation model (TIE-GCM). The methodology uses a page out of dynamical systems theory to first reduce the order of the state using dimensionality reduction and then modeling the temporal dynamics in the reduced state space. The methodology uses an ensemble of temporal dynamic models to provide uncertainty estimates in the prediction. This work focuses on the dimensionality reduction step of the ROPE development process and addresses three limitations of the proof-of-concept: (a) extending the altitude upper boundary from 450 km to nearly 1000 km, (b) employing deep learning for nonlinear dimensionality reduction over principal component analysis (PCA) for improved performance during storm periods, and (c) maintaining the spatial resolution of the physical TIE-GCM model, without down-sampling, to preserve the spatial scales and variations. Results show overall performance boost over PCA for the high-resolution and extrapolated data set as well as reduced reconstruction errors during storm-time conditions. This work represents a major step toward operationalization.

TI Neural Dynamics of Creative Movements During the Rehearsal and
   Performance of "LiveWire"
SO SCIENTIFIC DATA
LA English
DT Article
AB This report contains a description of physiological and motion data, recorded simultaneously and in synchrony using the hyperscanning method from two professional dancers using wireless mobile brain-body imaging (MoBI) technology during rehearsals and public performances of "LiveWire" - a new composition comprised of five choreographed music and dance sections inspired by neuroscience principles. Brain and ocular activity were measured using 28-channel scalp electroencephalography (EEG), and 4-channel electrooculography (EOG), respectively; and head motion was recorded using an inertial measurement unit (IMU) placed on the forehead of each dancer. Video recordings were obtained for each session to allow for tagging of physiological and motion signals and for behavioral analysis. Data recordings were collected from 10 sessions over a 4-month period, in which the dancers rehearsed or performed (in front of an audience) choreographed expressive movements. A detailed explanation of the experimental set-up, the steps carried out for data collection, and an explanation on the usage are provided in this report.

ID AUTONOMOUS EXPLORATION
AB The robot exploration problem focuses on maximizing the volumetric map of a previously unknown environment. This is a relevant problem in several applications, such as search and rescue and monitoring, which require autonomous robots to examine the surroundings efficiently. Graph-based planning approaches embed the exploration information into a graph describing the global map while the robot incrementally builds it. Nevertheless, even if graph-based representations are computational and memory-efficient, the exploration decisionmaking problem complexity increases according to the graph size that grows at each iteration. In this paper, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach trained with Reinforcement Learning (RL) that solves the decision-making problem for autonomous exploration. The learned policy represents the exploration expansion criterion, solving the decisionmaking problem efficiently and generalizing to different graph topologies and, consequently, environments. We validate the proposed approach with an aerial robot equipped with a depth camera in a benchmark exploration scenario using a high-performance physics engine for environment rendering. We compare the results against a state-of-the-art planning exploration algorithm, showing that the proposed approach matches its performance in terms of explored mapped volume. Additionally, our approach consistently maintains its performance regardless of the objective function used to explore the environment.

AB Metallic nanolaminates are promising materials for nuclear applications due to their ability to withstand extreme radiation environments by trapping irradiation-induced defects. However, the effects of irradiation-induced voids on confined layer slips (CLS) in nanolaminates remain largely unexplored. In this study, molecular dynamics simulations are employed to investigate how void size and location impact CLS in two types of Ag/Cu nanolaminates. Nanolaminated Ag and Ag single crystals are also studied as references. The results show that voids act as obstacles, significantly increasing the critical stress for dislocation glide. The void location plays a role in the critical stress but in different ways for different slip planes. The void-induced hardening is stronger on planes with lower intrinsic critical stress; as a result, adding a void homogenizes the resistance to CLS across different slip planes. Ag/Cu type II nanolaminates, where the two crystals have a "cube-on-cube" crystallographic orientation, demonstrate reduced void-induced hardening compared to type I, where two adjacent layers possess differing crystallographic orientations. In addition, some void-containing nanolaminated Ag show lower critical stress than their single-crystal line counterparts.

AB Relativistic plasmas around compact objects can sometimes be approximated as being force -free. In this limit, the plasma inertia is negligible and the overall dynamics is governed by global electric currents. We present a novel numerical approach for simulating such force -free plasmas, which allows for high accuracy in smooth regions as well as capturing dissipation in current sheets. Using a high-order accurate discontinuous Galerkin method augmented with a conservative finite-difference method, we demonstrate efficient global simulations of black hole and neutron star magnetospheres. In addition to a series of challenging test problems, we show that our approach can -depending on the physical properties of the system and the numerical implementation -be up to 10 x more efficient than conventional simulations, with a speedup of 2 -3 x for most problems we consider in practice.

ID CALIBRATION; UNCERTAINTY; REDUCTION; EQUATIONS
AB We explore model-form error and how to correct it in systems of ordinary differential equations. In particular, we focus on the Lotka-Volterra equations, which are used broadly in fields such as ecology, biology, economics, chemistry, and physics. Accounting for every object and their complex interactions with a complete model often becomes infeasible, thereby requiring reduced models. However, reduced models may omit vital relationships, resulting in discrepancies between reduced model predictions and observations from the true system. In this work, we propose a model correction framework for decreasing such discrepancies. Specifically, we embed a stochastic enrichment operator into the reduced model's system of equations. The enrichment operator is theory-informed, calibrated with observations from the complete model, and extended to extrapolative combinations of parameters and initial conditions. The complete model involves N species, while the reduced and enriched models only track M < N species. Numerical results show the enriched models significantly decrease discrepancies, consistently predict equilibria, and improve the species' transient behavior.

TI π-axion and π-axiverse of dark QCD
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
LA English
DT Article
ID MATTER
AB Axions and axionlike particles are a prominent dark matter candidate, drawing motivation in part from the axiverse of string theory. Axionlike particles can also arise as composite degrees of freedom of a dark sector, for example, as dark pions in dark quantum chromodynamics. In a dark Standard Model (SM) wherein all six quark flavors are light while the photon is massive, one finds a rich low-energy spectrum of stable and ultralight particles, in the form of neutral and charged dark scalars, and complex neutral scalars analogous to the SM kaon, with mass splittings determined by the mass and charge of the dark quarks. The model finds a natural portal to the visible sector via kinetic coupling of the dark and visible photons and consequent millicharges for dark matter. The dark matter can be a mixture of all these ultralight bosonic degrees of freedom and exhibits both parity-even and parity-odd interactions, making the theory testable at a wide variety of experiments. In context of dark QCD with Nf flavors of light quarks, this scenario predicts N2 f - 1 ultralight axionlike particles-effectively an axiverse from dark QCD. This "pi-axiverse" is consistent with but makes no recourse to string theory and is complementary to the conventional string theory axiverse.

TI High efficiency large-angle polarization-insensitive retroreflecting
   metasurface for magneto-optical traps
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS

ID ULTRACOLD ATOMS; INVERSE DESIGN; BEAM; SILICON; GROWTH; LIGHT; OXIDE
AB Three-dimensional magneto-optical traps (3D-MOTs) are an integral component of atomic clocks, quantum computers, and other cold-atom science applications. Due to the dependence on bulk optics and lasers, conventional 3D-MOTs occupy a large volume, limiting their portability. Efforts to build 3D-MOTs using integrated photonics promise to reduce the size and weight of these systems allowing applications beyond the lab. However, the need for counterpropagating beams to facilitate 4- and 6-beam geometries necessitates free-space mirrors and quarter wave plates (QWPs) that limit integration. Replacing these mirrors and QWPs with planar retroreflecting metasurfaces provides a route to achieving a complete 3D-MOT within an integrated package. Here, we report on the design and demonstration of a retroreflecting metasurface for 3D-MOTs that operates at large angles and preserves circular polarization. Specifically, we utilize Bayesian optimization to design an amorphous silicon (a-Si) on gold metasurface for high efficiency polarization-insensitive retroreflection of 780 nm circularly polarized light at 54.7 degrees. Numerical simulations demonstrate maintenance of circular polarization after highly efficient retroreflection (epsilon(-1)=1.10, R-1=0.86). Experimentally, we demonstrate similarly excellent performance at 736 nm at 50.3 degrees (epsilon(-1)=1.04, epsilon(-1)=0.73) and show that deviation from the target design is due to oxidation of the a-Si metaelements. We conclude by discussing mitigation strategies for future devices and propose a corrective optic for the currently fabricated device. This work represents a step toward the miniaturization of 3D-MOTs and expansion of cold-atom science beyond the laboratory.

AB As a superfamily of multifunctional enzymes that is mainly associated with xenobiotic adaptation, glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) facilitate insects' survival under chemical stresses in their environment. GSTs confer xenobiotic adaptation through direct metabolism or sequestration of xenobiotics, and/or indirectly by providing protection against oxidative stress induced by xenobiotic exposure. In this article, a comprehensive overview of current understanding on the versatile functions of insect GSTs in detoxifying chemical compounds is presented. The diverse structures of different classes of insect GSTs, specifically the spatial localization and composition of their amino acid residues constituted in their active sites are also summarized. Recent availability of whole genome sequences of numerous insect species, accompanied by RNA interference, X-ray crystallography, enzyme kinetics and site-directed mutagenesis techniques have significantly enhanced our understanding of functional and structural diversity of insect GSTs.

AB Decompilation is a crucial capability in forensic analysis, facilitating analysis of unknown binaries. The recent rise of Python malware has brought attention to Python decompilers that aim to obtain source code representation from a Python binary. However, Python decompilers fail to handle various binaries, limiting their capabilities in forensic analysis.
   This paper proposes a novel solution that transforms a decompilation error-inducing Python binary into a decompilable binary. Our key intuition is that we can resolve the decompilation errors by transforming error-inducing code blocks in the input binary into another form. The core of our approach is the concept of Forensically Equivalent Transformation (FET) which allows non-semantic preserving transformation in the context of forensic analysis. We carefully define the FETs to minimize their undesirable consequences while fixing various error-inducing instructions that are difficult to solve when preserving the exact semantics. We evaluate the prototype of our approach with 17,117 real-world Python malware samples causing decompilation errors in five popular decompilers. It successfully identifies and fixes 77,022 errors. Our approach also handles anti-analysis techniques, including opcode remapping, and helps migrate Python 3.9 binaries to 3.8 binaries.

AB Satellite-based quantum networks are emerging as a promising solution for the development of a global quantum Internet in the near future. The ability to leverage the advantageous lower attenuation of optical signals from satellites to ground presents an exciting opportunity to establish a robust and secure quantum communication infrastructure on a global scale. By utilizing a constellation of satellites, it becomes feasible to continuously distribute high-fidelity quantum entanglements among ground stations over long distances, overcoming the limitations of traditional terrestrial-based quantum communication systems. In this article, we first provide a brief survey of existing solutions for satellite-based entanglement distribution, highlighting the various approaches and technologies that have been employed in this rapidly evolving field. We then delve into a formulated optimal entanglement distribution problem, aiming to optimize the distribution of quantum entanglement resources across the satellite network to maximize efficiency and reliability. This problem is addressed through a detailed exploration of several different methodologies and algorithms, each tailored to specific operational settings and constraints. Our experimental results confirm the efficiency of these approaches and provide valuable insights into their practical implementation and performance. Finally, we identify several key directions for further study and development in the realm of satellite-based quantum networks.

AB Many introductions to homotopy type theory and the univalence axiom gloss over the semantics of this new formal system in traditional set-based foundations. This expository article, written as lecture notes to accompany a three-part mini course delivered at the Logic and Higher Structures workshop at CIRM-Luminy, attempt to survey the state of the art, first presenting Voevodsky's simplicial model of univalent foundations and then touring Shulman's vast generalization, which provides an interpretation of homotopy type theory with strict univalent universes in any infinity$\infty$-topos. As we will explain, this achievement was the product of a community effort to abstract and streamline the original arguments as well as develop new lines of reasoning.

SO HEALTH COMMUNICATION

ID TRAJECTORIES; EXPERIENCES; LANGUAGE
AB Metaphors are pervasive in cancer discourse. However, little is known about how metaphor use develops over time within the same patient, and how metaphor use and its content relate to the mental health of the patient. Here, we analyzed metaphor use in personal essays written by breast cancer patients shortly after the time of diagnosis and nine months later, in relation to their depressive symptoms at both time points. Results show that metaphor use can provide important insight into a patient's current mental state. Specifically, patients who had no change in their depressive symptom levels used metaphors more densely after nine months. In addition, metaphor valence in the later essay was associated with depressive symptoms at study entry and nine months after. Lastly, we observed a shift in metaphor reference pattern for different symptom trajectories, such that those who recovered from initially elevated depressive symptoms used fewer self-referencing metaphors and more cancer-referencing metaphors in their later essay. Our work suggests that metaphor use reflects how a patient is coping with their diagnosis.

AB Extreme stratospheric wave events are associated with intraseasonal fluctuations between cold and warm spells over North America, according to an analysis of observations and climate model simulations.
   Extreme cold events over North America such as the February 2021 cold wave have been suggested to be linked to stratospheric polar vortex stretching. However, it is not resolved how robustly and on which timescales the stratosphere contributes to the surface anomalies. Here we introduce a simple measure of stratospheric wave activity for reanalyses and model outputs. In contrast to the well-known surface influences of sudden stratospheric warmings (SSWs) that increase the intraseasonal persistence of weather regimes, we show that extreme stratospheric wave events are accompanied by intraseasonal fluctuations between warm and cold spells over North America in observations and climate models. Particularly, strong stratospheric wave events are followed by an increased risk of cold extremes over North America 5-25 days later. Idealized simulations in an atmospheric model with a well-resolved stratosphere corroborate that strong stratospheric wave activity precedes North American cold spells through vertical wave coupling. These findings potentially benefit the predictability of high-impact winter cold extremes over North America.

AB We report the results of polarization-dependent Raman spectroscopy of phonon states in single-crystalline quasi-one-dimensional NbTe4 and TaTe4 van der Waals materials. The measurements were conducted in the wide temperature range from 80 to 560 K. Our results show that although both materials have identical crystal structures and symmetries, there is a drastic difference in the intensity of their Raman spectra. While TaTe4 exhibits well-defined peaks through the examined wavenumber and temperature ranges, NbTe4 reveals extremely weak Raman signatures. The measured spectral positions of the phonon peaks agree with the phonon band structure calculated using the density-functional theory. We offer possible reasons for the intensity differences between the two van der Waals materials. Our results provide insights into the phonon properties of NbTe4 and TaTe4 van der Waals materials and indicate the potential of Raman spectroscopy for studying charge-density-wave quantum condensate phases.

AB Valleytronics, harnessing the valley degree of freedom in the momentum space, is a potential energy-efficient approach for information encoding, manipulation, and storage. Valley degree of freedom exists in a few conventional semiconductors, but recently the emerging 2D materials, such as monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), are considered more ideal for valleytronics, due to the additional protection from spin-valley locking enabled by their inversion symmetry breaking and large spin-orbit coupling. However, current limitations in the valley lifetime, operation temperature, and light-valley conversion efficiency in existing materials encumber the practical applications of valleytronics. In this article, the valley depolarization mechanisms and recent progress of novel materials are systematically reviewed for valleytronics beyond TMDs. Valley physics is first reviewed and the factors determining the valley lifetime, including the intrinsic electron-electron and electron-lattice interactions, as well as extrinsic defect effects. Then, experimentally demonstrated and theoretically proposed valley materials are introduced which potentially improve valley properties through the changes of spin-orbit coupling, electronic interactions, time-reversal symmetry, structures, and defects. Finally, the challenges and perspectives are summarized to realize valleytronic devices in the future.

AB We derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which a large class of relativistic generalizations of Braginskii's magnetohydrodynamics with shear, bulk, and heat diffusion effects is causal and strongly hyperbolic in the fully nonlinear regime in curved spacetime. We find that causality severely constrains the size of nonideal effects and the onset of kinetic instabilities. Our results are crucial for assessing the regime of validity of fluid dynamical simulations of plasmas near supermassive black holes.

AB The recent development of metasurfaces, which may enable several use cases by modifying the propagation environment, is anticipated to substantially affect the performance of sixth-generation (6G) wireless communications. Metasurface elements can produce passive subwavelength scattering to enable a smart radio environment. Simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS), which refers to reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) that can transmit and reflect concurrently (STAR), is gaining popularity. In contrast to the widely studied RIS, which can only reflect the wireless signal and serve users on the same side as the transmitter, the STAR-RIS can reflect and refract (transmit), enabling 360 & DEG; wireless coverage, thus serving users on both sides of the transmitter. This article presents a comprehensive review of the STAR-RIS, focusing on the most recent schemes for diverse use cases in 6G networks, resource allocation, and performance evaluation. We begin by laying the foundation for RIS (passive, active, and STAR-RIS), and then discuss the STAR-RIS protocols, advantages, and applications. In addition, we categorize the approaches within the domain of use scenarios, which include increasing coverage, enhancing physical-layer security (PLS), maximizing sum rate, improving energy efficiency (EE), and reducing interference. Next, we will discuss the various strategies for resource allocation and measures for performance evaluation. We aimed to elaborate, compare, and evaluate the literature regarding setup, channel characteristics, methodology, and objectives. In conclusion, we examine this field's open research problems and potential future prospects.

AB Metasurface-based optical elements offer a wide design space for miniature and lightweight optical applications. Typically, metasurface optical elements transform an incident light beam into a desired output waveform. Recent demonstrations of light-emitting metasurfaces highlight the potential for directly producing desired output waveforms via metasurface-mediated spontaneous emission. In this work, reciprocal finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations and machine learning are used to enable the inverse design of highly unidirectional photoluminescent III-Nitride quantum well metasurfaces capable of directive p-, s-, or combined p- and s- polarized emission at arbitrary angles. In comparison with previous intuition-guided designs using the same quantum well architectures, the inverse design approach enables new polarization capabilities and experimentally demonstrated improvements in directivity of 54%. An analysis of ways in which the inverse design both validates and contradicts previous intuition-guided design heuristics is presented. Ultimately, the combination of reciprocal simulations and efficient global optimization (EGO) grants remarkable improvements in emission directivity and results in full control over the polarization and momentum of emitted light, including simultaneous directional emission of s- and p-polarized light.
   Photoluminescent InGaN/GaN quantum well metasurfaces are optimized and fabricated for highly directional emission of p-, s-, or combined p- and s- polarization at arbitrary angles demonstrating an improvement in the directivity of 54% over previous results. image

AB Judge et al. recently argued that a region of the solar spectrum in the near-UV between about 250 and 290 nm is optimal for studying magnetism in the solar chromosphere, due to an abundance of Mg ii, Fe ii, and Fe i lines that sample various heights in the solar atmosphere. In this paper, we derive requirements for spectropolarimetric instruments to observe these lines. We derive a relationship between the desired sensitivity to magnetic field and the signal-to-noise ratio of the measurement from the weak-field approximation of the Zeeman effect. We find that many lines will exhibit observable polarization signals for both longitudinal and transverse magnetic field with reasonable amplitudes.

ID PREDICTION
AB Publishing trajectory data (individual's movement information) is very useful, but it also raises privacy concerns. To handle the privacy concern, in this paper, we apply differential privacy, the standard technique for data privacy, together with Markov chain model, to generate synthetic trajectories. We notice that existing studies all use Markov chain model and thus propose a framework to analyze the usage of the Markov chain model in this problem. Based on the analysis, we come up with an effective algorithm PrivTrace that uses the first-order and second-order Markov model adaptively. We evaluate PrivTrace and existing methods on synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the superiority of our method.

AB The 1 : 2 reaction of the imidazole-based dithiolate (2) with GeCl2 center dot dioxane in THF/TMEDA gives 3, a TMEDA-complexed dithiolene-based germylene. Compound 3 is converted to monothiolate-complexed (5) and N-heterocyclic carbene-complexed (7) germanium(II) dithiolene complexes via Lewis base ligand exchange. A bis-dithiolene-based germylene (8), involving a 3c-4e S-Ge-S bond, has also been synthesized through controlled hydrolysis of 7. The bonding nature of 3, 5, and 8 was investigated by both experimental and theoretical methods.
   The chemistry at the germylene and dithiolene interface has rarely been explored. Here, we report a series of Lewis base-coordinated germanium(II) dithiolene complexes. Controlled hydrolysis of the carbene-coordinated germanium(II) dithiolene complex affords a dianionic bis-dithiolene-based germanium(II) species.image

TI Scaling DEPP phylogenetic placement to ultra-large reference trees: a
   tree-aware ensemble approach
SO BIOINFORMATICS
LA English
DT Article
ID ACCURATE; GENE
AB Motivation Phylogenetic placement of a query sequence on a backbone tree is increasingly used across biomedical sciences to identify the content of a sample from its DNA content. The accuracy of such analyses depends on the density of the backbone tree, making it crucial that placement methods scale to very large trees. Moreover, a new paradigm has been recently proposed to place sequences on the species tree using single-gene data. The goal is to better characterize the samples and to enable combined analyses of marker-gene (e.g., 16S rRNA gene amplicon) and genome-wide data. The recent method DEPP enables performing such analyses using metric learning. However, metric learning is hampered by a need to compute and save a quadratically growing matrix of pairwise distances during training. Thus, the training phase of DEPP does not scale to more than roughly 10 000 backbone species, a problem that we faced when trying to use our recently released Greengenes2 (GG2) reference tree containing 331 270 species.Results This paper explores divide-and-conquer for training ensembles of DEPP models, culminating in a method called C-DEPP. While divide-and-conquer has been extensively used in phylogenetics, applying divide-and-conquer to data-hungry machine-learning methods needs nuance. C-DEPP uses carefully crafted techniques to enable quasi-linear scaling while maintaining accuracy. C-DEPP enables placing 20 million 16S fragments on the GG2 reference tree in 41 h of computation.Availability and implementation The dataset and C-DEPP software are freely available at https://github.com/yueyujiang/dataset_cdepp/.

AB 1. Low-coverage whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is increasingly used for the study of evolution and ecology in both model and non-model organisms; however, effective application of low-coverage WGS data requires the implementation of probabilistic frameworks to account for the uncertainties in genotype likelihoods. 2. Here, we present a probabilistic framework for using genotype likelihoods for standard population assignment applications. Additionally, we derive the Fisher information for allele frequency from genotype likelihoods and use that to describe a novel metric, the effective sample size, which figures heavily in assignment accuracy. We make these developments available for application through WGSassign, an open-source software package that is computationally efficient for working with whole-genome data. 3. Using simulated and empirical data sets, we demonstrate the behaviour of our assignment method across a range of population structures, sample sizes and read depths. Through these results, we show that WGSassign can provide highly accurate assignment, even for samples with low average read depths (<0.01X) and among weakly differentiated populations. 4. Our simulation results highlight the importance of equalizing the effective sample sizes among source populations in order to achieve accurate population assignment with low-coverage WGS data. We further provide study design recommendations for population assignment studies and discuss the broad utility of effective sample size for studies using low-coverage WGS data.

ID BRANCH SUPPORT; GENE; GREENGENES; TOOL
AB Large, updatable phylogenetic trees are constructed using a divide-and-conquer strategy.
   Phylogenetic trees provide a framework for organizing evolutionary histories across the tree of life and aid downstream comparative analyses such as metagenomic identification. Methods that rely on single-marker genes such as 16S rRNA have produced trees of limited accuracy with hundreds of thousands of organisms, whereas methods that use genome-wide data are not scalable to large numbers of genomes. We introduce updating trees using divide-and-conquer (uDance), a method that enables updatable genome-wide inference using a divide-and-conquer strategy that refines different parts of the tree independently and can build off of existing trees, with high accuracy and scalability. With uDance, we infer a species tree of roughly 200,000 genomes using 387 marker genes, totaling 42.5 billion amino acid residues.

By generating a unipolar optical signal, optical wireless communication and optical sensing can adopt the intensity modulation and direct detection scheme simultaneously. Benefited from the nearly-ideal correlation properties of the pulse sequence, the communication receiver can detect the pulse position, and the sensing receiver can estimate the target distance. Moreover, different performance metrics of communication and sensing are derived theoretically. Simulations show that the proposed method can carry out communication and sensing simultaneously, even in the multi-user scenario. Furthermore, different optical systems can adjust system parameters to adapt to different scenarios, so that they will enhance the ability of the future wireless network.

AB The emergence of complex deep neural networks made it crucial to employ interpretation methods for gaining insight into the rationale behind model predictions. However, recent studies have revealed attacks on these interpretations, which aim to deceive users and subvert the trustworthiness of the models. It is especially critical in medical systems, where interpretations are essential in explaining outcomes. This paper presents the first interpretation attack on predictive models using sequential electronic health records (EHRs). Prior attempts in image interpretation mainly utilized gradient-based methods, yet our research shows that our attack can attain significant success on EHR interpretations that do not rely on model gradients. We introduce metrics compatible with EHR data to evaluate the attack's success. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that detection methods that have successfully identified conventional adversarial examples are ineffective against our attack. We then propose a defense method utilizing auto-encoders to denoise the data and improve the interpretations' robustness. Our results indicate that this de-noising method outperforms the widely used defense method, SmoothGrad, which is based on adding noise to the data.

AB Reliable electricity and water access remain major challenges in rural communities worldwide. Standalone renewable energy systems show promise in improving access, but successful long-term outcomes remain infrequent in practice. To achieve sustainable outcomes, planners and decision makers should place a greater emphasis on understanding community context to determine the technological and social appropriacy of renewable energy technology. This article investigates a case study of renewable energy systems in the Navajo Nation to develop an understanding of what technical and social considerations may be necessary. A qualitative exploratory data analysis approach is used to perform a comparative analysis of two programs that deployed solar home systems (SHS) and atmospheric water generation (AWG) systems to address electricity and water needs in the Nation, respectively. The findings reveal that renewable energy programs should critically evaluate four factors related to technological and procedural appropriacy. These four factors are (1) an understanding of the productive use of the technology in context, (2) the need to operate within extant institutional paradigms, (3) the capacity to develop and maintain a support network, and (4) the need for trust building. The findings indicate that productive use of renewable energy is determined by end-user application and its usefulness in the community's rank order of priorities. It also demonstrates that social acceptance of renewable energy is affected by the willingness of programs to conform to existing institutional paradigms. This article refines and expands upon existing themes of social acceptance, making them more application oriented by focusing on the planning phase.

AB Partial differential equations whose solution is dominated by a combination of hyperbolic and dispersive waves are common in multiphase flows. We show that for these problems, the application of classical stabilized finite elements based on Streamline-Upwind/Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) without accounting for the dispersive features of the solution leads to a downwind discretization and an unstable numerical solution. To address this challenge, we propose the Dispersive-SUPG (D-SUPG) formulation. We apply the Dispersive-SUPG formulation to the Korteweg-de Vries equation and Direct van der Waals Simulations. Numerical results show that Dispersive-SUPG is a high-order accurate and efficient stabilized method, capable of producing stable results when the solution is dominated by either hyperbolic or dispersive waves. We finally applied the proposed algorithm to study cavitating flow over a 2D wedge and a 3D hemisphere and obtained good agreement with theory and experiments.

AB Low-level stratiform clouds modulate California's coastal climate during the warm season. Previous work describing the seasonal and daily variability of coastal low cloudiness (CLC) suggests that in July, August, and September southern California's CLC is under the influence of an additional driver, which has less impact in northern California. In this work, we introduce the link in which free-tropospheric moisture dictated by North American Monsoon (NAM) processes can impact southern California CLC. We use in situ and remote sensing observations, as well as reanalysis and single column model simulations to identify and investigate this previously missing component. We find that monsoonal moisture advected by southeasterly flow from the core NAM region into southern California reduces CLC by diminishing cloud-top longwave cooling. To add to an already complex brew of known factors influencing coastal cloudiness, another one is hereby introduced and should be accounted for in future work.

AB Gaussian Processes (GPs) are expressive models for capturing signal statistics and expressing prediction uncertainty. As a result, the robotics community has gathered interest in leveraging these methods for inference, planning, and control. Unfortunately, despite providing a closed-form inference solution, GPs are non-parametric models that typically scale cubically with the dataset size, hence making them difficult to be used especially on onboard Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) constrained aerial robots. In addition, the integration of popular libraries with GPs for different kernels is not trivial. In this paper, we propose GaPT, a novel toolkit that converts GPs to their state space form and performs regression in linear time. GaPT is designed to be highly compatible with several optimizers popular in robotics. We thoroughly validate the proposed approach for learning quadrotor dynamics on both single and multiple input GP settings. GaPT accurately captures the system behavior in multiple flight regimes and operating conditions, including those producing highly nonlinear effects such as aerodynamic forces and rotor interactions. Moreover, the results demonstrate the superior computational performance of GaPT compared to a classical GP inference approach on both single and multi-input settings especially when considering large number of data points, enabling realtime regression speed on embedded platforms used on SWaP-constrained aerial robots.

AB Social media platforms (like Twitter) positively and negatively impact users in diverse societies; one of Twitter's negative effects is the usage of hate and offensive language. Hate speech fosters prejudice; it also harms the vulnerable. There are always emotions associated with hateful and offensive actions. This work addressed hate and offensive tweet detection, low-level emotional classifications using 28 labels to train transformers models in three ways (model 1-BERTG28, model 2-BERTG27, and model 3-RoBERTa(G27)) before predicting the hateful and offensive tweets emotions. Model 1 was trained on low-level labels, and models 2 and 3 were trained on 27 labels excluding the neutral label. This study performed topic modeling to extract the discussed theme, spatiotemporal trends to determine where and when these tweets occurred, and event summarization for identified hate and offensive tweets. GoEmotions and Ekman were used for direct and indirect assessment, respectively, to evaluate the model's precision, recall, and F1-score. In terms of precision evaluation, the model 1 outperformed Google Research on GoEmotions. Furthermore, this study's model 2 and model 3 outperformed the Google research on both the GoEmotions and Ekman's evaluation in terms of precision and F1-score. Generally, model 2 was the best model in the analysis for both recall and F1-score while model 3 performed better for precision. Due to the training on samples without the neutral label, model 2 obtained 27% and model 3 achieved 29% label prediction out of the 30% neutral samples that was predicted in model 1 for hate and offensive tweets. This is a significant improvement to optimize classified emotions that are not truly neutral by eliminating the false neutral class.

AB Recommender systems (RSs) have become an indispensable part of online platforms. With the growing concerns of algorithmic fairness, RSs are not only expected to deliver high-quality personalized content, but are also demanded not to discriminate against users based on their demographic information. However, existing RSs could capture undesirable correlations between sensitive features and observed user behaviors, leading to biased recommendations. Most fair RSs tackle this problem by completely blocking the influences of sensitive features on recommendations. But since sensitive features may also affect user interests in a fair manner (e.g., race on culture-based preferences), indiscriminately eliminating all the influences of sensitive features inevitably degenerate the recommendations quality and necessary diversities. To address this challenge, we propose a path-specific fair RS (PSF-RS) for recommendations. Specifically, we summarize all fair and unfair correlations between sensitive features and observed ratings into two latent proxy mediators, where the concept of path-specific bias (PS-Bias) is defined based on path-specific counterfactual inference. Inspired by Pearl's minimal change principle, we address the PS-Bias by minimally transforming the biased factual world into a hypothetically fair world, where a fair RS model can be learned accordingly by solving a constrained optimization problem. For the technical part, we propose a feasible implementation of PSF-RS, i.e., PSF-VAE, with weakly-supervised variational inference, which robustly infers the latent mediators such that unfairness can be mitigated while necessary recommendation diversities can be maximally preserved simultaneously. Experiments conducted on semi-simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PSF-RS.

AB The synthesis of metal nanoparticles has become a priority for the advancement of nanotechnology. In attempts to create these nanoparticles, several different methods: chemistry, physics, and biology, have all been used. In this study, we report the reduction of cations using argon plasma chemistry to produce nanoparticles of gold (AuNPs), silver (AgNPs), and copper (CuNPs). Although other groups have used plasma-reduction methods to synthesize metal nanoparticles from their cation counterparts, these approaches often require plasma|liquid state interactions, high temperature, specific combinations of gases, and extended treatment times (>10 minutes), for which only specific cations (noble or non-noble) may be reduced. As a result, we have developed a non-thermal, low-pressure argon-plasma|solid state approach for the reduction of both noble and non-noble cations. More specifically, when 50 mu L droplets of 2 mM solutions of gold(iii) chloride, silver nitrate, or copper(ii) sulfate are exposed to vacuum, they undergo an evaporation process. As the pressure in the chamber decreases to 220 mTorr, the droplets become completely evaporated, leaving behind a metal precursor. Nucleation and growth studies reveal that when the metal precursors of gold(iii) chloride, silver nitrate, and copper(ii) sulfate are treated with 80 watts of argon plasma for 5, 60, and 150 seconds, respectively, nanoparticles could be synthesized with efficiency rates of upwards of 98%. The size of nanoparticles synthesized in this work was studied using Scanning Electron Microscopy, and the scattering properties of the nanoparticles was studied using UV/Vis spectroscopy. Transmission Electron Microscopy with corresponding elemental analysis was also very useful in confirming the identity of the synthesized nanoparticles. The results from this study reveal that we have synthesized metal nanoparticles with distinct chemical and physical properties. Scanning Electron Microscopy depicts AgNPs with a round-shape and diameters from 40-80 nm, while AuNPs were hexagonal, with sizes from 40-80 nm, and CuNPs were rod-shaped, with dimensions 40 by 160 nm. Our findings demonstrate that the argon plasma approach used in this study is a rapid, green, and versatile reduction method for the synthesis of both noble and non-noble metal nanoparticles.

AB Lean turbulent premixed hydrogen/air flames have substantially increased flame speeds, commonly attributed to differential diffusion effects. In this work, the effect of turbulence on lean hydrogen combustion is studied through Direct Numerical Simulation using detailed chemistry and detailed transport. Simulations are conducted at six Karlovitz numbers and four integral length scales. A general expression for the burning efficiency is proposed which depends on the conditional mean chemical source term and gradient of a progress variable, and the amount of superadiabatic burning. At a fixed Karlovitz number, the normalized turbulent flame speed and area both increase almost linearly with the integral length scale ratio. The effect on the mean source term profile is minimal, indicating that the increase in flame speed can solely be attributed to the increase in flame area. At a fixed integral length scale, both the flame speed and area first increase with Karlovitz number before decreasing. The qualitative observations and trends do not change when Soret effects are neglected. Specifically, neglecting Soret diffusion is shown to reduce the flame speed, area, and burning efficiency. At higher Karlovitz numbers, the diffusivity is enhanced due to penetration of turbulence into the reaction zone, significantly dampening differential diffusion effects.

ID REGRESSION; SELECTION
AB Optical spectrometers are essential tools for analysing light-matter interactions, but conventional spectrometers can be complicated and bulky. Recently, efforts have been made to develop miniaturized spectrometers. However, it is challenging to overcome the trade-off between miniaturizing size and retaining performance. Here, we present a complementary metal oxide semiconductor image sensor-based miniature computational spectrometer using a plasmonic nanoparticles-in-cavity microfilter array. Size-controlled silver nanoparticles are directly printed into cavity-length-varying Fabry-P & eacute;rot microcavities, which leverage strong coupling between the localized surface plasmon resonance of the silver nanoparticles and the Fabry-P & eacute;rot microcavity to regulate the transmission spectra and realize large-scale arrayed spectrum-disparate microfilters. Supported by a machine learning-based training process, the miniature computational spectrometer uses artificial intelligence and was demonstrated to measure visible-light spectra at subnanometre resolution. The high scalability of the technological approaches shown here may facilitate the development of high-performance miniature optical spectrometers for extensive applications.
   Conventional spectrometers can be bulky and efforts are being made to develop miniaturised versions. Here, the authors present a miniature computational spectrometer based on silver nanoparticles in Fabry-P & eacute;rot microcavities for measuring visible spectra.

AB Background and Aims The increased likelihood and severity of storm events has brought into focus the role of coastal ecosystems in provision of shoreline protection by attenuating wave energy. Canopy-forming kelps, including giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera), are thought to provide this ecosystem service, but supporting data are extremely limited. Previous in situ examinations relied mostly on comparisons between nominally similar sites with and without kelp. Given that other factors (especially seafloor bathymetry and topographic features) often differ across sites, efforts to isolate the effects of kelp on wave energy propagation confront challenges. In particular, it can be difficult to distinguish wave energy dissipation attributable to kelp from frictional processes at the seabed that often covary with the presence of kelp. Here, we use an ecological transition from no kelp to a full forest, at a single site with static bathymetry, to resolve unambiguously the capacity of giant kelp to damp waves. Methods We measured waves within and outside rocky reef habitat, in both the absence and the presence of giant kelp, at Marguerite Reef, Palos Verdes, CA, USA. Nested within a broader kelp restoration project, this site transitioned from a bare state to one supporting a fully formed forest (density of 8 stipes m-2). We quantified, as a function of incident wave conditions, the decline in wave energy flux attributable to the presence of kelp, as waves propagated from outside and into reef habitat. Key Results The kelp forest damped wave energy detectably, but to a modest extent. Interactions with the seabed alone reduced wave energy flux, on average, by 12 +/- 1.4 % over 180 m of travel. The kelp forest induced an additional 7 +/- 1.2 % decrease. Kelp-associated declines in wave energy flux were slightly greater for waves of longer periods and smaller wave heights. Conclusions Macrocystis pyrifera forests have a limited, albeit measurable, capacity to enhance shoreline protection from nearshore waves. Expectations that giant kelp forests, whether extant or enhanced through restoration, have substantial impacts on wave-induced coastal erosion might require re-evaluation.

AB Wind direction observations are instrumental weather records that hold promise for improving historical weather reanalyses and extending them deeper into the past. Two methods are developed for assimilating wind direction observations. The first uses a linear observation model with Gaussian additive error, and is thus amenable to use in standard EnKF and variational frameworks. The second is nonlinear and non-Gaussian, and is based on a two-step approach for sampling from the Bayesian posterior. Both methods are tested in the context of an idealized two-dimensional model of turbulent fluid dynamics. The nonlinear, non-Gaussian method assimilating only wind direction observations performs as well as an EnKF assimilating only pressure observations, whereas the first method based on the linear model provides no benefit when assimilating only wind direction observations. The method based on the linear model performs well when paired with other observations, e.g. of pressure, since it performs best when the forecast of wind direction is not far from correct.

AB This work reports in situ (active) electrochemical control over the coupling strength between semiconducting nanoplatelets and a plasmonic cavity. We found that by applying a reductive bias to an Al nanoparticle lattice working electrode the number of CdSe nanoplatelet emitters that can couple to the cavity is decreased. Strong coupling can be reversibly recovered by discharging the lattice at oxidative potentials relative to the conduction band edge reduction potential of the emitters. By correlating the number of electrons added or removed with the measured coupling strength, we identified that loss and recovery of strong coupling are likely hindered by side processes that trap and/or inhibit electrons from populating the nanoplatelet conduction band. These findings demonstrate tunable, external control of strong coupling and offer prospects to tune selectivity in chemical reactions.

AB We introduce dynamic predictive coding, a hierarchical model of spatiotemporal prediction and sequence learning in the neocortex. The model assumes that higher cortical levels modulate the temporal dynamics of lower levels, correcting their predictions of dynamics using prediction errors. As a result, lower levels form representations that encode sequences at shorter timescales (e.g., a single step) while higher levels form representations that encode sequences at longer timescales (e.g., an entire sequence). We tested this model using a two-level neural network, where the top-down modulation creates low-dimensional combinations of a set of learned temporal dynamics to explain input sequences. When trained on natural videos, the lower-level model neurons developed space-time receptive fields similar to those of simple cells in the primary visual cortex while the higher-level responses spanned longer timescales, mimicking temporal response hierarchies in the cortex. Additionally, the network's hierarchical sequence representation exhibited both predictive and postdictive effects resembling those observed in visual motion processing in humans (e.g., in the flash-lag illusion). When coupled with an associative memory emulating the role of the hippocampus, the model allowed episodic memories to be stored and retrieved, supporting cue-triggered recall of an input sequence similar to activity recall in the visual cortex. When extended to three hierarchical levels, the model learned progressively more abstract temporal representations along the hierarchy. Taken together, our results suggest that cortical processing and learning of sequences can be interpreted as dynamic predictive coding based on a hierarchical spatiotemporal generative model of the visual world.
   The brain is adept at predicting stimuli and events at multiple timescales. How do the neuronal networks in the brain achieve this remarkable capability? We propose that the neocortex employs dynamic predictive coding to learn hierarchical spatiotemporal representations. Using computer simulations, we show that when exposed to natural videos, a hierarchical neural network that minimizes prediction errors develops stable and longer timescale responses at the higher level; lower-level neurons learn space-time receptive fields similar to the receptive fields of primary visual cortical cells. The same network also exhibits several effects in visual motion processing and supports cue-triggered activity recall. Our results provide a new framework for understanding the genesis of temporal response hierarchies and activity recall in the neocortex.

AB We present a multiscale molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study on self-assembly in methylcellulose (MC) aqueous solutions. First, using MD simulations with a new coarse-grained (CG) model of MC chains in implicit water, we establish how the MC chains self-assemble to form fibrils and fibrillar networks and elucidate the MC chains' packing within the assembled fibrils. The CG model for MC is extended from a previously developed model for unsubstituted cellulose and captures the directionality of H-bonding interactions between the -OH groups. The choice and placement of the CG beads within each monomer facilitates explicit modeling of the exact degree and position of methoxy substitutions in the monomers along the MC chain. CG MD simulations show that with increasing hydrophobic effect and/or increasing H-bonding strength, the commercial MC chains (with degree of methoxy substitution, DS, similar to 1.8) assemble from a random dispersed configuration into fibrils. The assembled fibrils exhibit consistent fibril diameters regardless of the molecular weight and concentration of MC chains, in agreement with past experiments. Most MC chains' axes are aligned with the fibril axis, and some MC chains exhibit twisted conformations in the fibril. To understand the molecular driving force for the twist, we conduct atomistic simulations of MC chains preassembled in fibrils (without any chain twists) in explicit water at 300 and 348 K. These atomistic simulations also show that at DS = 1.8, MC chains adopt twisted conformations, with these twists being more prominent at higher temperatures, likely as a result of shielding of hydrophobic methyl groups from water. For MC chains with varying DS, at 348 K, atomistic simulations show a nonmonotonic effect of DS on water-monomer contacts. For 0.0 < DS < 0.6, the MC monomers have more water contacts than at DS = 0.0 or DS > 0.6, suggesting that with few methoxy substitutions, the MC chains are effectively hydrophilic, letting the water molecules diffuse into the fibril to participate in H-bonds with the MC chains' remaining -OH groups. At DS > 0.6, the MC monomers become increasingly hydrophobic, as seen by decreasing water contacts around each monomer. We conclude based on the atomistic observations that MC chains with lower degrees of substitutions (DS <= 0.6) should exhibit solubility in water over broader temperature ranges than DS similar to 1.8 chains.

TI Shortest Paths Govern Bond Rupture in Thermoset Networks
SO MACROMOLECULES

DT Article

AB Understanding bond rupture in polymer networks remains a fundamental challenge due to the interplay of network topology and condensed phase effects. In this work, we introduce a predictive approach for determining bond rupture in thermosets based on shortest paths (SPs) analysis of the network topology. This method enumerates SP sets in networks with periodic boundary conditions, with applications to both all-atom and coarse-grained simulations. We find that bond rupture is most likely to initiate on the first (shortest) SP in the thermoset network and the strain at which the first bond ruptures is linearly correlated with the topological path length. As a result, one can predict the first bond rupture by computing the first SP directly from the initial thermoset topology without resorting to MD simulations. Furthermore, the specific bond rupture location along the first SP follows a probability distribution associated with the SP-based betweenness centrality. Subsequent bond rupture events are dictated by the instantaneous SP of partially broken networks. Moreover, we quantify the length scale dependence of SP distributions, introducing a means of partially bridging the observed ductile rupture in molecular simulations and brittle rupture in experiments.

AB This paper presents the first security study of THz networks employing antennas with the angle-frequency coupling property. Using Leaky Wave Antennas (LWAs) as a representative, we explore the unique security properties due to the frequency-dependent radiation. We show via both analytical models and over-the-air experiments that LWA links exhibit non-uniform secrecy capacity across sub-channels, yielding advantages to an eavesdropper at edge frequencies. Yet, because different frequencies emit towards different angles, the eavesdropper is thwarted from easily intercepting an entire wideband transmission. The experiments diverge from the analytical model in that the model underpredicts the eavesdropper's advantage at angles smaller than the target user and subsequent asymmetric performance across angles. Nonetheless, both the model and measurements show that increasingly wide bandwidth and correspondingly wide beams have only a modest marginal security penalty. Further, we find the LWA link secrecy not only depends on the target user angle (due to nonlinearity of LWA's frequency-angle coupling), but also the beamwidth of the frequency components that constitute the collective LWA transmission.

AB Bacterial synthetic multicellular systems are promising platforms for engineered living materials (ELMs) for medical, biosynthesis, environmental, and smart materials applications. Recent advancements in genetically encoded adhesion toolkits have enabled precise manipulation of cell -cell adhesion and the design and patterning of self -assembled multicellular materials. However, in contrast to gene regulation in synthetic biology, the characterization and control of synthetic adhesins remains limited. Here, we demonstrate the quantitative characterization of a bacterial synthetic adhesion toolbox through various biophysical methods. We determine key parameters, including number of adhesins per cell, in -membrane diffusion constant, production and decay rates, and bond -breaking force between adhesins. With these parameters, we demonstrate the bottom -up prediction and quantitative tuning of macroscopic ELM properties (tensile strength) and, furthermore, that cells inside ELMs are connected only by a small fraction of available adhesins. These results enable the rational engineering, characterization, and modeling of other synthetic and natural adhesins and multicellular consortia.

AB We present stellar parameters and chemical abundances of 47 elements detected in the bright (V = 11.63) very metal-poor ([Fe/H] = -2.20 +/- 0.12) star 2MASS J22132050-5137385. We observed this star using the Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle spectrograph as part of ongoing work by the R-Process Alliance. The spectrum of 2MASS J22132050-5137385 exhibits unusually strong lines of elements heavier than the iron group, and our analysis reveals that these elements were produced by rapid neutron-capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis. We derive a europium enhancement, [Eu/Fe] = +2.45 +/- 0.08, that is higher than any other r-process-enhanced star known at present. This star is only the eighth r-process-enhanced star where both thorium and uranium are detected, and we calculate the age of the r-process material, 13.6 +/- 2.6 Gyr, from the radioactive decay of these isotopes. This star contains relatively large enhancements of elements that may be produced as transuranic fission fragments, and we propose a new method using this characteristic to assess the r-process yields and gas dilution in samples of r-process-enhanced stars. Assuming a canonical baryonic minihalo mass of 10(6) M-circle dot and a 1% metal retention rate, this star formed in a cloud of only similar to 600 M-circle dot. We conclude that 2MASS J22132050-5137385 exhibits a high level of r-process enhancement because it formed in an environment where the r-process material was less diluted than average.

AB Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively learn a machine learning model without exchanging their own local data. In this way, the server can exploit the computational power of all clients and train the model on a larger set of data samples among all clients. Although such a mechanism is proven to be effective in various fields, existing works generally assume that each client preserves sufficient data for training. In practice, however, certain clients may only contain a limited number of samples (i.e., few-shot samples). For example, the available photo data taken by a specific user with a new mobile device is relatively rare. In this scenario, existing FL efforts typically encounter a significant performance drop on these clients. Therefore, it is urgent to develop a few-shot model that can generalize to clients with limited data under the FL scenario. In this paper, we refer to this novel problem as federated few-shot learning. Nevertheless, the problem remains challenging due to two major reasons: the global data variance among clients (i.e., the difference in data distributions among clients) and the local data insufficiency in each client (i.e., the lack of adequate local data for training). To overcome these two challenges, we propose a novel federated few-shot learning framework with two separately updated models and dedicated training strategies to reduce the adverse impact of global data variance and local data insufficiency. Extensive experiments on four prevalent datasets that cover news articles and images validate the effectiveness of our framework compared with the state-of-the-art baselines. Our code is provided(1).

TI Conceptual framework assessment of knowledge integration in student

AB In this study, a conceptual framework of measurement uncertainty was developed and used to guide the development of a multiple-choice concept test for the assessment of students' knowledge integration in learning measurement uncertainty. Based on assessment data and interview results, students were identified into three levels of knowledge integration including novice, intermediate, and expertlike. The reasoning pathways of students at different levels revealed a progression of reasoning from a rudimentary surface level to a deep understanding that can be mapped in the conceptual framework. This work demonstrates the possibility of identifying a quantitative categorization scheme to model knowledge integration as well as its utility in teaching and learning. Overall, the assessments and interviews revealed common and persistent difficulties in students' understanding of measurement uncertainty. In addition, students at different levels of knowledge integration demonstrate unique types of knowledge states that can be represented in the conceptual framework, making it a useful tool for analyzing different reasoning pathways and knowledge structures.

AB In epidemic networks, walk-based centrality indices are often used to identify the nodes that are significantly contributing to the spread of disease. While the network topology can provide a good insight into how the disease might propagate throughout the network, epidemic-related factors can change the ranking results as well. This paper presents a dynamics-based node centrality that incorporates epidemic characteristics, internal time delays, and network structure at the same time. This centrality allows for dynamic identification of the nodes that are more sensitive to external shocks, which in turn can help prevent performance degradation in the network. It is shown that some of the prominent walk-based centralities, such as local and eigenvector centralities, are in fact correlated with dynamics-based centrality for certain epidemic parameters.

TI SPADE: Synthesizing Data Quality Assertions for Large Language Model
   Pipelines
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE VLDB ENDOWMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Large language models (LLMs) are being increasingly deployed part of pipelines that repeatedly process or generate data of some sort. However, a common barrier to deployment are the frequent and often unpredictable errors that plague LLMs. Acknowledging the inevitability of these errors, we propose data quality assertions to identify when LLMs may be making mistakes. We present SPADE, a method for automatically synthesizing data quality assertions that identify bad LLM outputs. We make the observation that developers often identify data quality issues during prototyping prior to deployment, and attempt to address them by adding instructions to the LLM prompt over time. SPADE therefore analyzes histories prompt versions over time to create candidate assertion functions and then selects a minimal set that fulfills both coverage and accuracy requirements. In testing across nine different real-world LLM pipelines, SPADE efficiently reduces the number of assertions by 14% and decreases false failures by 21% when compared to simpler baselines. SPADE has been deployed as an offering within LangSmith, LangChain's LLM pipeline hub, and has been used to generate data quality assertions for over 2000 pipelines across a spectrum industries.

TI Ultra-low cost supercapacitors from coal char: effect of electrolyte on
   double layer capacitance
SO ENERGY ADVANCES

ID GRAPHENE NANOSHEETS; ENERGY-STORAGE; OXIDES; CARBON
AB Electrochemical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) provide high power density and long cycle life energy storage. This work examines the use of inexpensive, raw coal char as an electrode material for supercapacitors. The effect of electrolyte composition on the performance of coal char supercapacitors is explored for the first time to determine the relative contributions of double-layer capacitance vs. faradaic reactions on total charge storage. Six electrolytes are examined with coal char electrodes, including: four aqueous electrolytes (0.5 M H2SO4, 6 M KOH, 0.5 M Na2SO4, 4 M LiNO3); a water-in-salt electrolyte using 13 m NaClO4; and an ionic liquid electrolyte (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate in acetonitrile). Voltage range, specific capacitance, electrochemical impedance, and charge-discharge characteristics of the coal char in the different electrolytes are characterized. The results indicate that neutral aqueous, water-in-salt, and ionic liquid electrolytes present a charging/discharging process approaching ideal EDLC behavior. The study provides insight into the optimal electrolyte composition for use with coal char electrodes and contributes to the current understanding of electrode-electrolyte interactions in carbon supercapacitors.
   Untreated coal char is explored as an ultra-low cost supercapacitor material in various electrolytes.

TI The interdependent transport of yeast vacuole Ca<SUP>2+</SUP> and H+ and

AB Yeast vacuoles are acidified by the v-type H+-ATPase (VATPase) that is comprised of the membrane embedded VO complex and the soluble cytoplasmic V1 complex. The assembly of the V1-VO holoenzyme on the vacuole is stabilized in part through interactions between the VO a-subunit ortholog Vph1 and the lipid phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P2). PI(3,5)P2 also affects vacuolar Ca2+ release through the channel Yvc1 and uptake through the Ca2+ pump Pmc1. Here, we asked if H+ and Ca2+ transport activities were connected through PI(3,5)P2. We found that overproduction of PI(3,5)P2 by the hyperactive fab1T2250A mutant augmented vacuole acidification, whereas the kinase-inactive fab1EEE mutant attenuated the formation of a H+ gradient. Separately, we tested the effects of excess Ca2+ on vacuole acidification. Adding micromolar Ca2+ blocked vacuole acidification, whereas chelating Ca2+ accelerated acidification. The effect of adding Ca2+ on acidification was eliminated when the Ca2+/H+ antiporter Vcx1 was absent, indicating that the vacuolar H+ gradient can collapse during Ca2+ stress through Vcx1 activity. This, however, was independent of PI(3,5)P2, suggesting that PI(3,5)P2 plays a role in submicromolar Ca2+ flux but not under Ca2+ shock. To see if the link between Ca2+ and H+ transport was bidirectional, we examined Ca2+ transport when vacuole acidification was inhibited. We found that Ca2+ transport was inhibited by halting V-ATPase activity with Bafilomycin or neutralizing vacuolar pH with chloroquine. Together, these data show that Ca2+ transport and V-ATPase efficacy are connected but not necessarily through PI(3,5)P2.

AB This work introduces a novel and efficient Bayesian federated learning algorithm, namely, the Federated Averaging stochastic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (FA-HMC), for parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification. We establish rigorous convergence guarantees of FA-HMC on non-iid distributed datasets, under the strong convexity and Hessian smoothness assumptions. Our analysis investigates the effects of parameter space dimension, noise on gradients and momentum, and the frequency of communication (between the central node and local nodes) on the convergence and communication costs of FA-HMC. Beyond that, we establish the tightness of our analysis by showing that the convergence rate cannot be improved even for continuous FA-HMC process. Moreover, extensive empirical studies demonstrate that FA-HMC outperforms the existing Federated Averaging-Langevin Monte Carlo (FA-LD) algorithm. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.

AB This paper presents a theoretical model examining the interaction between a fibrous network and viscous fluid flow driven by an oscillating boundary. The aim is to understand how oscillating impacts are transmitted from the skull, through the arachnoid trabeculae network filled with cerebrospinal fluid, as observed in shaken baby syndrome. The model uses an effective medium approach to determine the fluid velocity field while each fiber is treated as a soft string undergoing deformation. Results indicate that the frequency of oscillation, fiber stiffness, and porous structure resistance significantly influence the oscillating shearing flow, as indicated by the Womersley ( Wo), Brinkman ( alpha), and Bingham ( Bm) numbers. Application of the model to shaken baby syndrome suggests that oscillations in the cerebrospinal fluid and arachnoid trabeculae can significantly surpass those on the skull, leading to intense shear stress penetration to the brain. This model is the first study to integrate the dynamic response of string-like fibrous networks in fluid flows with oscillating boundaries and offers a quantitative framework for predicting the transmission of shearing forces from the skull to the brain matter.

AB Embedding rare-earth monopnictide nanoparticles into III-V semiconductors enables unique optical, electrical, and thermal properties for THz photoconductive switches, tunnel junctions, and thermoelectric devices. Despite the high structural quality and control over growth, particle size (<3 nm), and density, the underlying electronic structure of these nanocomposite materials has only been hypothesized. Structural and electronic properties of ErAs nanoparticles with different shapes and sizes (cubic to spherical, 1.14, 1.71, and 2.28 nm) in AlAs, GaAs, InAs, and their alloys are investigated using first-principles calculations, revealing that spherical nanoparticles have lower formation energies. For the lowest-energy nanoparticles, the Fermi level is pinned near midgap in GaAs and AlAs but resonant in the conduction band in InAs. The Fermi level is shifted down as the particle size increases and is pinned on an absolute energy scale considering the band alignment at AlAs/GaAs/InAs interfaces, offering insights into the rational design of these nanomaterials.

AB Medium-voltage (MV) power converts have various intended applications in renewable energy resources integration, power substations, and electrical mobility. The high power and high switching frequency of MV power converters have necessitated the development of a contactless current sensing technique based on magnetoresistive (MR) sensors to provide galvanic isolation, wide bandwidth, and minimum stray inductive on the current path. The prevailing solution involves placing the MR sensor under a straight printed circuit board (PCB) trace. However, this setup suffers reduced sensitivity due to sensor installation errors and inaccurate measurement owing to the nearby interfering conductors. To address these two issues, a double circular PCB trace is proposed to replace the traditional straight PCB trace. In the proposal, two MR sensors are encircled by a circular PCB trace separately. The interference impact is mitigated by subtracting the differential output from the sensors. Additionally, the double circular trace (DC trace) is optimally designed to enhance the position tolerance of sensor installation by providing a uniform magnetic field within the sensing area. The experiment measurement under a 2 mm position error shows that the proposed method improves the sensitivity from 0.1736 V/A in the conventional straight trace to 0.5902 V/A. Moreover, the sensitivity remains consistent even in the presence of interfering conductors.

AB Liquid phase-separating proteins can form condensates that play an important role in spatial and temporal organization of biological cells. The understanding of the mechanisms that lead to the formation of protein condensates and their interactions with other biomolecules may lead to processing routes for soft materials with tailored geometry and function. Fused in sarcoma (FUS) is an example of a nuclear protein that forms stable complexes, and recent studies have highlighted its ability to wet actin filaments and bundle them into networks. We perform coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the wetting and spreading of FUS droplets on actin filaments. We employ the Martini model and rescale the protein-protein and protein-actin interactions to tune the interfacial and wetting properties of FUS droplets. By measuring the molecular displacements in the three-phase region, we are able to relate contact angle, contact line velocity, and contact line friction in terms of a linear approximation of molecular kinetic theory. The results show that the rescaled Martini model can be used to study the molecular mechanisms of dynamic wetting at the nanoscale and to obtain quantitative predictions of the contact line friction and contact angles during dynamic wetting.

Here, EPB activity is investigated over a 15-day period with overlapping coincident ground-based 630 nm oxygen airglow measurements, near-infrared hydroxyl mesospheric temperature mapper (MTM) measurements, and Rate Of change of Total Electron Content Index (ROTI) values. The data are compared with the Navy Global Environmental Model (NAVGEM) reanalysis over the same time period. It is found that several days with strong EPB activity coincided with the positive/northward meridional wind phase of the quasi-two-day wave (QTDW) in the mesosphere. These initial observations indicate correlations of the QTDW phase and the occurrence rates of EPBs, and suggest a need for further investigations to assess potential causal relationships that may affect the variability and prevalence of EPBs.

AB The reaction of peracetic acid (PAA) and Fe(II) has recently gained attention due to its utility in wastewater treatment and its role in cloud chemistry. Aerosol-cloud interactions, partly mediated by aqueous hydroxyl radical (OH) chemistry, represent one of the largest uncertainties in the climate system. Ambiguities remain regarding the sources of OH in the cloud droplets. Our research group recently proposed that the dark and light-driven reaction of Fe(II) with peracids may be a key contributor to OH formation, producing a large burst of OH when aerosol particles take up water as they grow to become cloud droplets, in which reactants are consumed within 2 min. In this work, we quantify the OH production from the reaction of Fe(II) and PAA across a range of physical and chemical conditions. We show a strong dependence of OH formation on ultraviolet (UV) wavelength, with maximum OH formation at lambda = 304 +/- 5 nm, and demonstrate that the OH burst phenomenon is unique to Fe(II) and peracids. Using kinetics modeling and density functional theory calculations, we suggest the reaction proceeds through the formation of an [Fe(II)-(PAA)(2)(H2O)(2)] complex, followed by the formation of a Fe(IV) complex, which can also be photoactivated to produce additional OH. Determining the characteristics of OH production from this reaction advances our knowledge of the sources of OH in cloudwater and provides a framework to optimize this reaction for OH output for wastewater treatment purposes.

AB We investigate the entropy of liquid water at ambient conditions using the two-phase thermodynamic (2PT) model, applied to both common pairwise-additive water models and the MB-pol and MB-pol(2023) data-driven many-body potentials. Our simulations demonstrate that the 2PT model yields entropy values in semiquantitative agreement with experimental data when using MB-pol and MB-pol(2023). Additionally, our analyses indicate that the entropy values predicted by pairwise-additive water models may benefit from error compensation between the inherent approximations of the 2PT model and the known limitations of these water models in describing many-body interactions. Despite its approximate nature, the simplicity of the 2PT model makes it a valuable tool for estimating relative entropy changes of liquid water across various environments, especially when combined with water models that provide a consistently robust representation of the structural, thermodynamic, and dynamical properties of liquid water.

AB As AI systems are increasingly transforming our society, it is critical to support relevant stakeholders to have appropriate understanding and trust in these systems. My dissertation research explores how AI transparency and explainability can help with this goal. I begin with human-centered evaluations of current AI explanation techniques, focusing on their usefulness for people in understanding model behavior and calibrating trust. Next, I identify what explainability needs real AI end-users have and what factors influence their trust through an in-depth case study of a real-world AI application. Finally, I describe two studies, one ongoing and one proposed, that investigate transparency and explainability approaches for Generative AI, such as large language models, to enable safe and successful interactions with this new and powerful technology. My dissertation contributes to both HCI and AI fields by elucidating mechanisms and factors of trust in AI and detailing design considerations for AI transparency and explainability approaches.

AB Climate model projections of atmospheric circulation patterns, their frequency, and associated temperature and precipitation anomalies under a high-end global warming scenario are assessed over the Pacific Northwest of North America for the final three decades of the twenty-first century. Model simulations are from phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) and circulation patterns are identified using the self-organizing maps (SOMs) approach, applied to 500-hPa geopotential height (Z500) anomalies. Overall, the range of projected circulation patterns is similar to that in the current climate, especially in winter, whereas in summer the models project a general reduction in the magni-tude of Z500 anomalies. Significant changes in pattern frequencies are also projected in summer, with an overall decrease in the frequency of patterns with large Z500 anomalies. In winter, patterns historically associated with anomalously cold weather in northern latitudes are projected to warm the most, and in summer the largest temperature increases are pro-jected over inland areas. Precipitation is found to increase across all seasons and most SOM patterns. However, some summer patterns that are associated with above-average precipitation in the current climate are projected to become signif-icantly drier by the end of the century. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This paper uses a novel method to analyze projections of large-scale atmospheric circulation over the Pacific Northwest of North America, reducing the uncertainty of changes to the circulation patterns over the region under a high-emissions scenario of global warming.

TI 'Tipping points' confuse and can distract from urgent climate action
SO NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE
LA English
DT Review
ID EARTHS CLIMATE; RISK; GOVERNANCE; PATHWAYS; DYNAMICS; POLITICS; ELEMENTS
AB Tipping points have gained substantial traction in climate change discourses. Here we critique the 'tipping point' framing for oversimplifying the diverse dynamics of complex natural and human systems and for conveying urgency without fostering a meaningful basis for climate action. Multiple social scientific frameworks suggest that the deep uncertainty and perceived abstractness of climate tipping points render them ineffective for triggering action and setting governance goals. The framing also promotes confusion between temperature-based policy benchmarks and properties of the climate system. In both natural and human systems, we advocate for clearer, more specific language to describe the phenomena labelled as tipping points and for critical evaluation of whether, how and why different framings can support scientific understanding and climate risk management.
   The tipping points framing is widely used in climate discussions but receives mixed feedback. This Perspective critiques it for oversimplifying the complexities of natural and social systems and failing to drive effective action, and offers recommendations for future improvements.

AB While the number of infectious zoonotic disease outbreaks has been rising, their impact on civil war and social conflict is poorly understood. This study addresses this fundamental limitation using a geolocated monthly dataset on 22 zoonotic diseases in Africa. Zoonotic disease is a key driver of new epidemics, making such pathogens a useful test case. Results suggest that over the January 1997 to December 2019 period, zoonotic disease was negatively associated with state initiation of civil conflict and positively associated with social conflict involving identity militias. Additional analyses find that the effect for identity militias is consistent with a causal interpretation. Rebel violence is not significantly associated with outbreaks. The results are robust to endogeneity concerns and additional sensitivity analyses.
   Koren and Bukari use geolocated data on zoonotic diseases in Africa (1997-2019) to examine their impact on conflict. They find that zoonotic diseases are linked to a decrease in state-initiated civil wars but an increase in social conflicts involving identity militias.

AB Thermal switching materials, whose thermal conductivity can be controlled externally, show great potential in contemporary thermal management. The manipulation of thermal transport properties through magnetic fields has been accomplished in materials that exhibit a high magnetoresistance. However, it is generally understood that the lattice thermal conductivity attributed to phonons is not significantly impacted by the magnetic fields. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate the significant impact of phonon-magnon scattering on the thermal conductivity of the rare-earth metal gadolinium near room temperature, which can be controlled by a magnetic field to realize thermal switching. Using first-principles lattice dynamics and spin-lattice dynamics simulations, we attribute the observed change in phononic thermal conductivity to field-suppressed phonon-magnon scattering. This research suggests that phonon-magnon scattering in ferromagnetic materials is crucial to determine their thermal conductivity, opening the door to innovative magnetic-field-controlled thermal switching materials.

AB The formation and evolution of a heterogeneous flow and flow reversal are examined in highly elastic, gel-like wormlike micelles (WLMs) formed from an amphiphilic triblock poloxamer P234 in 2M NaCl. A combination of linear viscoelastic, steady shear, and creep rheology demonstrate that these WLMs have a yield stress and exhibit viscoelastic aging, similar to some soft glassy materials. Nonlinear shear rheology and rheoparticle tracking velocimetry reveal that these poloxamer WLMs undergo a period of strong elastic recoil and flow reversal after the onset of shear startup. As flow reversal subsides, a fluidized high shear rate region and a nearly immobile low shear rate region of fluid form, accompanied by wall slip and elastic instabilities. The features of this flow heterogeneity are reminiscent of those for aging yield stress fluids, where the heterogeneous flow forms during the initial stress overshoot and is sensitive to the inherent stress gradient of the flow geometry. Additionally, macroscopic bands that form transiently above a critical shear rate become "trapped" due to viscoelastic aging in the nearly immobile region. This early onset of the heterogeneous flow during the rapidly decreasing portion of the stress overshoot differs from that typically observed in shear banding WLMs and is proposed to be necessary for observing significant flow reversal. Exploring the early-time, transient behavior of this WLM gel with rheology similar to both WLM solutions and soft glassy materials provides new insights into spatially heterogeneous flows in both of these complex fluids.

TI A Corrosion Maintenance Model Using Continuous State Partially
   Observable Markov Decision Process for Oil and Gas Pipelines
SO ALGORITHMS
LA English
DT Article
DE maintenance; oil and gas pipeline; partially observable Markov decision

AB This paper proposes a continuous state partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) model for the corrosion maintenance of oil and gas pipelines. The maintenance operations include complex and extensive activities to detect the corrosion type, determine its severity, predict the deterioration rate, and plan future inspection (monitoring) schemes and maintenance policy. A POMDP model is formulated as a decision-making support tool to effectively handle partially observed corrosion defect levels. It formulates states as the pipeline's degradation level using a probability distribution. Inline inspection (ILI) methods estimate the latest state of the pipeline, which also defines the initial state of the optimization process. The set of actions comprises corrosion mitigation operations. The errors associated with the ILI method are used to construct the observation function for the model. The sum of inspection, maintenance operations, and failure costs for a given state and action are formulated as rewards. Numerical experiments are made based on data collected from the literature. The results showed that different policies, whether derived from solvers (theoretical) or determined from practical experience, can be compared to identify the best maintenance alternative using the model. It was also observed that the choice of the solvers is important since they affect the discounted rewards and the run time to obtain them. The model approximates the parameters and uncertainty associated with the propagation of corrosion, proficiency of inspection methods, and implementation of maintenance policies. Overall, it can be applied to improve the maintenance decision-making process for the oil and gas pipeline as it incorporates the stochastic features of the operation.

AB A guided wireless electric vehicle (EV) charging strategy was proposed to effectively mitigate the issue of misalignment, which could result in decreased charging efficiency in wireless charging systems. Typically, sensor data fusion and mapping-based techniques are employed to establish the relationship between the sensor output and coil position. However, the implementation of these techniques necessitates sensor arrays or imposes a substantial computational burden. To address these challenges, an alternative methodology arises through the estimation of coil coordinates based on magnetic field components. In this proposal, the ratio of in-plane magnetic field components (denoted as B-y/B-x) is employed for the determination of coil coordinates. The proposed method is operationalized with the integration of merely four dual-axis anisotropic magnetoresistive (AMR) sensors affixed at the receiver coil side as point field detectors. This streamlined configuration facilitates the derivation of a concise formula for the numerical positioning of the coil. Following the adjustment of the receiver coil contingent upon estimated coil coordinates, a wireless charging stage was triggered on the transmitter coil side. The trigger signal was generated by the relay's action, obviating the necessity for supplementary communication devices. A laboratory-scale wireless EV charging prototype was developed and tested. The proposed method possesses the merits of being accurate, computationally efficient, and communication-free. There were 187 samples demonstrated in the testing range of 20 x 16 cm. The positioning errors were found to be less than 1 cm which validated the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB The ability to insolubilize doped semiconducting polymer layers can help enable the fabrication of efficient multilayer solution-processed electronic and optoelectronic devices. Here, we present a promising approach to simultaneously n-dope and largely insolubilize conjugated polymer films using tetrakis[{4-(1,3-dimethyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)phenoxy}methyl]methane (tet-rakis-O-DMBI-H), which consists of four 2,3-dihydro-1H-benzoimida-zole (DMBI-H) n-dopant moieties covalently linked to one another. Doping a thiophene-fused benzodifurandione-based oligo(p-phenyl-enevinylene)-co-thiophene polymer (TBDOPV-T) with tetrakis-O-DMBI-H results in a highly n-doped film with bulk conductivity of 15 S cm-1. Optical absorption spectra provide evidence for film retention of & SIM;93% after immersion in o-dichlorobenzene for 5 min. The optical absorption signature of the charge carriers in the n-doped polymer decreases only slightly more than that of the neutral polymer under these conditions, indicating that the exposure to solvent also results in negligible dedoping of the film. Moreover, thermal treatment studies on a tetrakis-O-DMBI-H-doped TBDOPV-T film in contact with another undoped polymer film indicate immobilization of the molecular dopant in TBDOPV-T. This is attributed to the multiple electrostatic interactions between each dopant tetracation and up to four nearby anionic doped polymer segments.

AB The conditions in Mira variable atmospheres make them wonderful laboratories to study a variety of stellar physics such as molecule-grain formation, dust production, shock chemistry, stellar winds, mass loss, opacity-driven pulsation, and shocks. We were awarded an NSF grant to analyze over a decade of synoptic observations from the Palomar Testbed Interferometer (PTI) of 106 Miras to curate a Mira Reference Dataset. The Miras included in this dataset include M-types, S-types, and C-types, and span a wide range of pulsation periods. PTI measured K-band angular sizes that when combined with a distance allow us to directly determine fundamental stellar parameters such as effective temperature, radial size, and bolometric flux. Supplementing observations with interferometric measurements of the stars opens the Mira laboratory to a wealth of different experiments. We provide two case studies to serve as examples of the power of the Mira Reference Dataset. The first case study describes combining PTI measurements with Spitzer IRS spectra of M-type Miras, which allowed us to fully characterize CO2 gas in their atmospheres. The second case study examines how PTI narrow-band data can be used to study phase-dependent pulsation effects on the stellar atmosphere. We provide a list of all the Miras (with coordinates) included in the set for anyone who would like to add them to their observing programs. All the data we produce and collate for this Mira Reference Dataset will be hosted and curated on a website open to the public so that other researchers and citizen scientists can participate in expanding the utility and body of knowledge on this set of "wonderful" stars.

AB Materials in crystalline form possess translational symmetry (TS) when the unit cell is repeated in real space with long- and short-range orders. The periodic potential in the crystal regulates the electron wave function and results in unique band structures, which further define the physical properties of the materials. Amorphous materials lack TS due to the randomization of distances and arrangements between atoms, causing the electron wave function to lack a well-defined momentum. High entropy materials provide another way to break the TS by randomizing the potential strength at periodic atomic sites. The local elemental distribution has a great impact on physical properties in high entropy materials. It is critical to distinguish elements at the sub-nanometer scale to uncover the correlations between the elemental distribution and the material properties. Here, the use of synchrotron X-ray scanning tunneling microscopy (SX-STM) with sub-nm scale resolution in identifying elements on a high entropy alloy (HEA) surface is demonstrated. By examining the elementally sensitive X-ray absorption spectra with an STM tip to enhance the spatial resolution, the elemental distribution on an HEA's surface at a sub-nm scale is extracted. These results open a pathway towards quantitatively understanding high entropy materials and their material properties.
   A new methodology capable of distinguishing elements on the surface of a high entropy alloy at sub-nm scale is presented. This is achieved by combining scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and synchrotron radiation in the X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurement. The elemental fingerprints are enabled with the XAS while the spatial resolution is achieved using the STM. image

AB Neutron stars close to the Galactic center are expected to swim in a dense background of dark matter. For models in which the dark matter has efficient interactions with neutrons, they are expected to accumulate their own local cloud of dark matter, making them appealing targets for observations seeking signs of dark matter annihilation. For theories with very light mediators, the dark matter may annihilate into pairs of mediators which are sufficiently long-lived to escape the star and decay outside it into neutrinos. We examine the bounds on the parameter space of heavy (similar to TeV to similar to PeV) dark matter theories with long-lived mediators decaying into neutrinos based on observations of high energy neutrino observatories, and make projections for the future. We find that these observations provide information that is complementary to terrestrial searches, and probe otherwise inaccessible regimes of dark matter parameter space.

AB Catalytic conversion provides a path for tackling the global problem of plastic waste handling. The product distributions depend on the location of C-C scission on a catalyst, and thus on the conformation of the polymer on the catalyst surface. However, the effects of catalyst surface morphology on polymer melt adsorption are not well understood. Here, we study Pt surfaces of different terminations and polymers of varying chain sizes to probe the impact of terrace width on polyethylene (PE) conformations on the catalyst surface. We parametrize an atomistic force field using density functional theory calculations and perform replica-exchange molecular dynamics simulations on the PE-catalyst systems. We find that the surface morphology alters the conformations of PE. Stepped surfaces favor shorter adsorbed segments but more such segments adsorb per chain. They also induce more ordering in the adsorbed segments than the flat surface, which has implications for the ability of mean-field models to describe polymer adsorption on surfaces and their subsequent reactions. The smaller chains, earlier believed to be entirely adsorbed on the surface, do not do so on stepped surfaces. We discuss the ramifications of these findings for the hydrogenolysis of PE on catalyst metal nanoparticles.

AB Adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing by ADAR1 has been implicated in maintaining self-tolerance, preventing autoimmunity, and mediating antiviral immunity. Foreign viral double-stranded RNA triggers rapid interferon response and activates ADAR1 in the host immune system. Emerging data points to a role of ADAR1 A-to-I editing in the inflammatory response associated with severe COVID-19 disease. We identify A-to-I editing events within human whole transcriptome data from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, non-infected individuals, and individuals with other viral illnesses from nasopharyngeal swabs. High levels of RNA editing in host cells are associated with low SARS-CoV-2 viral load (p = 9.27 E-06), suggesting an inhibitory effect of ADAR1 on viral infection. Additionally, we find differentially expressed genes associated with RNA-modifications and interferon response. Single cell RNA-sequencing analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infected nasopharyngeal swabs reveals that cytotoxic CD8 T cells upregulate ADAR1 in COVID-19 positive samples (p = 0.0269). We further reveal ADAR1 expression increases with CD4 and CD8 T cell activation, and knockdown of ADAR1 leads to apoptosis and aberrant IL-2 secretion. Together, our data suggests A-to-I RNA editing is required to maintain healthy homeostasis of activated T cells to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Overcoming inherent challenges such as variations in pixel intensities, noisy boundaries, and overlapping edges, our devised pipeline integrates the U-Net architecture with state-of-the-art CNN models, such as EfficientNet. This fusion maintains the efficiency of U-Net while harnessing the superior capabilities of EfficientNet. Crucially, we exclusively utilize high-quality confocal images generated in-house for model training, purposefully avoiding the pitfalls associated with publicly available synthetic data of lower quality. Our training dataset encompasses over 3000 nuclei boundaries, which are meticulously annotated manually to ensure precision and accuracy in the learning process. Additionally, post-processing is implemented to refine segmentation results, providing morphological quantification for each segmented nucleus. Through comprehensive evaluation, our model achieves notable performance metrics, attaining an F1-score of 87% and an Intersection over Union (IoU) value of 80%. Furthermore, its robustness is demonstrated across diverse datasets sourced from various origins, indicative of its broad applicability in automating nucleus extraction and quantification from fluorescent images. This innovative methodology holds significant promise for advancing research efforts across multiple domains by facilitating a deeper understanding of underlying biological processes through automated analysis of fluorescent imagery.

AB Smartphones and wearable sensors offer an unprecedented ability to collect peripheral psychophysiological signals across diverse timescales, settings, populations, and modalities. However, open-source software development has yet to keep pace with rapid advancements in hardware technology and availability, creating an analytical barrier that limits the scientific usefulness of acquired data. We propose a community-driven, open-source peripheral psychophysiological signal pre-processing and analysis software framework that could advance biobehavioral health by enabling more robust, transparent, and reproducible inferences involving autonomic nervous system data.

AB During emergencies where time is of the essence, efficient management of disasters depends on swiftly recognizing relevant and urgent information from online platforms like X (Twitter), which is imperative for augmenting established response frameworks, such as the 911 emergency system. This paper introduces CURD, a Context-aware Relevance and Urgency Determination system designed to enhance the efficiency of disaster response. The system addresses two critical challenges: filtering out irrelevant data and assessing the urgency of relevant information. Our approach includes a multi-level annotation process for event type, relevancy, and an urgency annotation algorithm that significantly improves information extraction accuracy and efficiency. CURDdl, our classifier, uses a deep learning pipeline architecture with a combination of transformer models, a convolution layer, and custom attention mechanisms to classify disaster-related tweets into multiclass-event type, binary-relevance-and-urgency categories, and rank urgent ones based on significance. Experimental results show that our best baseline classifiers for all three tasks achieved >= 88% F1 and accuracy, and >= 94%. AUC. Our models also outperformed models from related works in all metrics, validating the effectiveness of CURD in prioritizing response messages that will facilitate decisionmaking and resource allocation in disaster scenarios. CURD annotated dataset and code are available on GitHub1.

TI A hidden population of active galactic nuclei can explain the

AB The first wave of observations with JWST has revealed a striking overabundance of luminous galaxies at early times (z > 10) compared to models of galaxies calibrated to pre-JWST data. Early observations have also uncovered a large population of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at z > 6. Because many of the high-z objects appear extended, the contribution of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) to the total luminosity has been assumed to be negligible. In this work, we use a semi-empirical model for assigning AGNs to galaxies to show that active galaxies can boost the stellar luminosity function (LF) enough to solve the overabundance problem while simultaneously remaining consistent with the observed morphologies of high-z sources. We construct a model for the composite AGN+galaxy LF by connecting dark matter halo masses to galaxy and SMBH masses and luminosities, accounting for dispersion in the mapping between host galaxy and SMBH mass and luminosity. By calibrating the model parameters - which characterize the M-center dot-M-* relation - to a compilation of z > 10 JWST UVLF data, we show that AGN emission can account for the excess luminosity under a variety of scenarios, including one where 10% of galaxies host BHs of comparable luminosities to their stellar components. Using a sample of simulated objects and real observations, we demonstrate that such low-luminosity AGNs can be `hidden' in their host galaxies and be missed in common morphological analyses. We find that for this explanation to be viable, our model requires a population of BHs that are overmassive (M-center dot/M-* similar to 10(-2)) with respect to their host galaxies compared to the local relation and are more consistent with the observed relation at z = 4-8. We explore the implications of this model for BH seed properties and comment on observational diagnostics necessary to further investigate this explanation.

AB A rigid tetracene dimer with a substantial interchromophoredistancehas been prepared through an application of the recently developedcatalytic arene-norbornene annulation (CANAL) reaction. An iterativecycloaddition route was found to be unsuccessful, so a shorter routewas adopted whereby fragments were coupled in the penultimate stepto form a 13:1 mixture of two diastereomers, the major of which wasisolated and crystallized. Constituent tetracene moieties are linkedwith a rigid, well-defined bridge and feature a near-co-planar mutualorientation of the acenes.

AB Stimuli-responsive hydrogels with programmable shapes produced by defined patterns of particles are of great interest for the fabrication of small-scale soft actuators and robots. Patterning the particles in the hydrogels during fabrication generally requires external magnetic or electric fields, thus limiting the material choice for the particles. Acoustically driven particle manipulation, however, solely depends on the acoustic impedance difference between the particles and the surrounding fluid, making it a more versatile method to spatially control particles. Here, an approach is reported by combining direct acoustic force to align photothermal particles and photolithography to spatially immobilize these alignments within a temperature-responsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) hydrogel to trigger shape deformation under temperature change and light exposure. The spatial distribution of particles can be tuned by the power and frequency of the acoustic waves. Specifically, changing the spacing between the particle patterns and position alters the bending curvature and direction of this composite hydrogel sheet, respectively. Moreover, the orientation (i.e., relative angle) of the particle alignments with respect to the long axis of laser-cut hydrogel strips governs the bending behaviors and the subsequent shape deformation by external stimuli. This acousto-photolithography provides a means of spatiotemporal programming of the internal heterogeneity of composite polymeric systems.

AB We present the method of direct van der Waals simulation (DVS) to study computationally flows with liquid -vapor phase transformations. Our approach is based on a discretization of the Navier-Stokes-Korteweg equa-tions, which couple flow dynamics with van der Waals' nonequilibrium thermodynamic theory of phase trans-formations, and opens an opportunity for first-principles simulation of a wide range of boiling and cavitating flows. The proposed algorithm enables unprecedented simulations of the Navier-Stokes-Korteweg equations involving cavitating flows at strongly under-critical conditions and O(105) Reynolds number. The proposed tech-nique provides a pathway for a fundamental understanding of phase-transforming flows with multiple applica-tions in science, engineering, and medicine.

AB Approximate Thompson sampling with Langevin Monte Carlo broadens its reach from Gaussian posterior sampling to encompass more general smooth posteriors. However, it still encounters scalability issues in high-dimensional problems when demanding high accuracy. To address this, we propose an approximate Thompson sampling strategy, utilizing underdamped Langevin Monte Carlo, where the latter is the goto workhorse for simulations of high-dimensional posteriors. Based on the standard smoothness and log-concavity conditions, we study the accelerated posterior concentration and sampling using a specific potential function. This design improves the sample complexity for realizing logarithmic regrets from (O) over tilde (d) to (O) over tilde(root d). The scalability and robustness of our algorithm are also empirically validated through synthetic experiments in highdimensional bandit problems.

AB Efficient crisis management relies on prompt and precise analysis of disaster data from various sources, including social media. The advantage of fine-grained, annotated, class-labeled data is the provision of a diversified range of information compared to high-level label datasets. In this study, we introduce a dataset richly annotated at a low level to more accurately classify crisis-related communication. To this end, we first present DisTGranD, an extensively annotated dataset of over 47,600 tweets related to earthquakes and hurricanes. The dataset uses the Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) standard to provide detailed classification into dual-layer annotation for events and sub-events and identify critical triggers and supporting arguments. The inter-annotator evaluation of DisTGranD demonstrated high agreement among annotators, with Fleiss Kappa scores of 0.90 and 0.93 for event and sub-event types, respectively. Moreover, a transformer-based embedded phrase extraction method showed XLNet achieving an impressive 96% intra-label similarity score for event type and 97% for sub-event type. We further proposed a novel deep learning classification model, RoBiCCus, which achieved >= 90% accuracy and F1-Score in the event and sub-event type classification tasks on our DisTGranD dataset and outperformed other models on publicly available disaster datasets. DisTGranD dataset represents a nuanced class-labeled framework for detecting and classifying disaster-related social media content, which can significantly aid decision-making in disaster response. This robust dataset enables deep- learning models to provide insightful, actionable data during crises. Our annotated dataset and code are publicly available on GitHub 1

AB Fundamental principles underlying computation in multi-scale brain networks illustrate how multiple brain areas and their coordinated activity give rise to complex cognitive functions. Whereas brain activity has been studied at the micro- to meso-scale to reveal the connections between the dynamical patterns and the behaviors, investigations of neural population dynamics are mainly limited to single-scale analysis. Our goal is to develop a cross-scale dynamical model for the collective activity of neuronal populations. Here we introduce a bio-inspired deep learning approach, termed NeuroBondGraph Network (NBGNet), to capture cross-scale dynamics that can infer and map the neural data from multiple scales. Our model not only exhibits more than an 11-fold improvement in reconstruction accuracy, but also predicts synchronous neural activity and preserves correlated low-dimensional latent dynamics. We also show that the NBGNet robustly predicts held-out data across a long time scale (2 weeks) without retraining. We further validate the effective connectivity defined from our model by demonstrating that neural connectivity during motor behaviour agrees with the established neuroanatomical hierarchy of motor control in the literature. The NBGNet approach opens the door to revealing a comprehensive understanding of brain computation, where network mechanisms of multi-scale activity are critical.

AB We present an analytical framework for evolving the dynamics of active rods under any periodic external potential, including confining channels and arrays of harmonic traps. As a proof of concept, we analyze the structure and dispersion of self-propelled rods under a soft, periodic one-dimensional (1D) confinement potential and under a two-dimensional (2D) periodic radial harmonic trap. While passive rods and polymers nematically order under 1D confinement, their diffusive transport along the director is limited by thermal diffusion. In contrast, self-propelled rods can generate large convective fluxes when combined with nematic ordering, producing a strong dispersion along the director. Combining theory and simulation, we demonstrate that nematic alignment and self-propulsion generates an exponential enhancement in active diffusivity along the director, in contrast to passive rods that experience at most a 2-fold increase.
   We present an analytical framework for evolving the dynamics of active rods under any periodic external potential; as a proof of concept, we use this to calculate rod dispersion in confining channels and alignment in arrays of harmonic traps.

AB Seismic soil-structure interaction (SSI), stratigraphic variability, and layering influence liquefaction triggering, the resulting total surface deformations, and damage to buildings and infrastructure. The existing empirical procedures for evaluating liquefaction triggering are primarily based on case history observations of surface manifestation and treat susceptible granular deposits as uniform and isolated. Meanwhile, most natural granular deposits are spatially variable due to heterogeneities in soil hydraulic conductivity, layer thickness, relative density, and continuity. In this paper, three-dimensional (3D), fully coupled, nonlinear finite-element analyses (FEA) in OpenSees, validated with centrifuge experimental results, are used to systematically evaluate the influence of layering and stratigraphic variations on the system's performance. We evaluate the response of two dissimilar, multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF), shallow-founded structures. The ejecta potential index (EPI) is used to quantify the potential for formation of soil ejecta in different configurations. EPI is shown to depend strongly on the location of the groundwater table, average thickness and continuity of the liquefiable layer, and properties of and proximity to the structure. The mechanisms of deformation captured by a continuum FEA (volumetric and deviatoric) as well as the extent of softening (quantified with ru) within the critical layer are shown as uncorrelated with EPI, which depends primarily on the nature of hydraulic gradients developed within the profile. The results point to the importance of considering stratigraphic variability and potential variations in groundwater table together with average soil properties and structural characteristics when evaluating the ejecta potential on liquefiable sites.

AB The combustion of hydrogen in low-swirl burners (LSB) is considered as an alternative means of generating power because it is characterized by low emissions and high efficiency. However, lean hydrogen premixed flames are subject to thermodiffusive instabilities induced by the large diffusivity, and hence small Lewis number, of hydrogen. The numerical modelling of these flows remains challenging because the transition of small scale instabilities into large scale turbulent structures cannot be modelled by conventional strategies. Recently, Schlup and Blanquart (2019) developed a two-equation model which captures successfully the phenomena arising from differential diffusion and curvature effects. The chemistry tabulation framework is based on the classical progress variable approach and introduces an additional transport equation to account for fluctuations in the local equivalence ratio due to these effects. In the current work, this model is extended to large eddy simulation (LES) of an LSB. The LES model is applied first to a CH 4 /air flame (cent cent = 0.59) . 59 ) to validate the overall simulation framework and then to a H 2 /air flame (cent cent = 0 . 4 ). The results obtained with this new formulation show significant improvement over the traditional one-equation formulation. The unique flow field exhibited by lean hydrogen is reproduced successfully using the two-equation model.

AB The elucidation of novel bonding situations at heavy p-block elements has greatly advanced recent efforts to access useful reactivity at earth-abundant main-group elements. Molecules with unsaturated bonds between heavier, electropositive elements and lighter, electronegative elements are often highly polarized and competent in small-molecule activations, but the reactivity of these molecules may be quenched by self-association of monomers to form oligomeric species where the polar, unsaturated groups are assembled in a head-to-tail fashion. In this Frontier, we discuss the synthetic strategies employed to isolate monomeric sigma 2,lambda 3-stibinidene chalcogenides (RSbCh) and monomeric sigma 4,lambda 5-stibine chalcogenides (R3SbCh). These classes of molecules each feature polarized antimony-chalcogenide bonds (Sb = Ch/Sb+-Ch-). We highlight how the synthesis and isolation of these molecules has led to the discovery of novel reactivity and has shed light on fundamental aspects of inorganic structure and bonding. Despite these advances, there are critical aspects of this chemistry that remain underdeveloped and we provide our perspective on yet-unrealized synthetic targets that may be achieved with the continued development of the strategies described herein.
   The synthetic strategies employed to isolate monomeric stibinidene chalcogenides (RSbCh) and monomeric stibine chalcogenides (R3SbCh) are discussed, and a perspective on the outcomes and future directions of this exciting area is provided.

AB Formulating state estimation for a large-scale, discrete-time, linear time-invariant system as a least-squares problem can be computationally challenging as the problem dimensions increase with time. Recently, randomized sampling has demonstrated promising results in approximating this problem by using fewer rows, resulting in a polynomial-sized approximate problem. However, these algorithms necessitate calculating the statistical leverage scores of the rows, which can be challenging. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to approximate leverage scores by uniformly sampling rows. We demonstrate that this method provides a sufficiently weak form of approximation for obtaining an estimate of each leverage score. Our approach delivers a reasonable approximation of the leverage scores, which is suitable for approximating and solving the least-squares estimation problem with proven theoretical guarantees.

AB The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in La3Ni2O7 offers a fresh platform for exploring unconventional pairing mechanisms. Starting with the basic argument that the electrons in d(z)(2) orbitals nearly form local moments, we examine the effect of the Hubbard interaction U on the binding strength of Cooper pairs based on a single-orbital bilayer model with intralayer hopping t(parallel to) and interlayer superexchange J(perpendicular to). By extensive density matrix renormalization group calculations, we observe a remarkable enhancement in binding energy as much as 10-20 times larger with U/t(parallel to) increasing from 0 to 12 at J(perpendicular to)/t(parallel to) similar to 1. We demonstrate that such a substantial enhancement stems from a kinetic-energy-driven mechanism. Specifically, a Z(2) Berry phase will emerge at large U due to the Hilbert space restriction (Mottness), which strongly suppresses the mobility of single particle propagation as compared to U = 0. However, the kinetic energy of the electrons (holes) can be greatly restored by forming an interlayer spin-singlet pairing, which naturally results in a superconducting state even for relatively small J(perpendicular to). An effective hard-core bosonic model is further proposed to estimate the superconducting transition temperature at the mean-field level.

AB In this paper, we extend the Generalized Finite Difference Method (GFDM) on unknown compact submanifolds of the Euclidean domain, identified by randomly sampled data that (almost surely) lie on the interior of the manifolds. Theoretically, we formalize GFDM by exploiting a representation of smooth functions on the manifolds with Taylor's expansions of polynomials defined on the tangent bundles. We illustrate the approach by approximating the Laplace-Beltrami operator, where a stable approximation is achieved by a combination of Generalized Moving Least -Squares algorithm and novel linear programming that relaxes the diagonal -dominant constraint for the estimator to allow for a feasible solution even when higher -order polynomials are employed. We establish the theoretical convergence of GFDM in solving Poisson PDEs and numerically demonstrate the accuracy on simple smooth manifolds of low and moderate high co -dimensions as well as unknown 2D surfaces. For the Dirichlet Poisson problem where no data points on the boundaries are available, we employ GFDM with the volume -constraint approach that imposes the boundary conditions on data points close to the boundary. When the location of the boundary is unknown, we introduce a novel technique to detect points close to the boundary without needing to estimate the distance of the sampled data points to the boundary. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the volume -constraint employed by imposing the boundary conditions on the data points detected by this new technique compared to imposing the boundary conditions on all points within a certain distance from the boundary, where the latter is sensitive to the choice of truncation distance and requires the knowledge of the boundary location.

AB We performed in situ X-ray diffraction and ultrasonic sound velocity measurements on hcp-Fe up to 15 GPa, 873 K in a multi-anvil apparatus. The elastic moduli and their pressure and temperature derivatives were determined by fitting the velocity and density data to the third-order finite strain equations, yielding KS0 = 169.0(57) GPa, KS0 ' = 5.4(6), (partial derivative KS/partial derivative T)P = -0.031(3) GPa/K, G0 = 104.5(27) GPa, G0 ' = 1.7(2), (partial derivative G/partial derivative T)P = -0.060(2) GPa/K. Within the experimental P-T range, we find significant temperature effect on the density-velocity (rho - VP or S) relations and caution the use of the temperature-independent Birch's law for extrapolation to core conditions. Furthermore, temperature-induced velocity decrease is more significant in VS than in VP, offering a possible explanation for the high Poisson's ratio in the core. Extrapolations based on our results together with previous experimental data suggest that VP of hcp-Fe aligns with PREM at Earth's core conditions, while Vs and density are approximately 10% and 2.7% higher than PREM, respectively.
   Iron is believed to be the predominant constituent of the Earth's core. Comparing the physical properties of Fe at high P-T conditions with the seismological observations provides a strong constraint on the composition of Earth's core and thus aids our understanding of the dynamics and evolution of the Earth. In this study, we measured the density, compressional and shear velocities of iron simultaneously at high pressure and high temperature conditions. We found that temperature plays a significant role in decreasing the velocity of iron, especially for the shear wave velocities. We modeled the velocity profiles of Earth's inner core based on elasticity data from this study and previous studies. Our results suggest that while the compressional velocity of hcp-Fe demonstrates a good match, the density is slightly heavier, and the shear velocity is faster than the seismic observations. A comprehensive explanation of the seismic observations necessitates considering other light elements in the core.
   Direct measurements of sound velocities of hcp-Fe at simultaneous high P-T Large temperature-induced shear softening in hcp-Fe help explain the high Poisson ratio in the Earth's inner core Velocity profiles of hcp-Fe at Earth's inner core are faster than PREM

AB ACIGS solar cells are exposed to targeted radiation to probe the front and back interfaces of the absorber to assess the impact of space environments on these systems. These data suggest ACIGS cells are more radiation-hard than early CIGS devices likely due to the lower defect densities and more ideal interfaces in the ACIGS system. A combination of J-V and external quantum efficiency measurements indicates some improvement in the performance of the device due to the effects of local heating in the dominant ionizing electronic energy loss regime of proton irradiation that anneal the upper CdS/ACIGS interface. However, nonionizing energy losses at the base of the solar cell also appear to inhibit minority carrier collection from the back of the cell at the ACIGS/Mo interface, which is discussed in terms of defect-mediated changes in the doping profile, the Ga/Ga+In ratio, and impurity composition after proton irradiation.
   Herein, Ag-alloyed Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (ACIGS) solar cells are assessed using targeted proton irradiation to evaluate their stability inspace. The data suggest ACIGS solar cells are more radiation-hard than early Cu(In,Ga)Se2 devices. Improvements are also observed upon proton irradiation due to local heating at the interfaces in the ACIGS cells studied.image (c) 2023 WILEY-VCH GmbH

AB Ordered intermetallic materials are promising candidates for applications in extreme environments due to the strong localized bonding schemes that stabilize the structures against degradation. Here, we investigate the propensity for deformation twinning modes in the L 2 1-ordered MnCu2Al intermetallic by inducing a state of severe plastic deformation. Post-mortem microstructural analysis reveals the presence of meso-scale deformation twins accompanied by a high degree of nano-scale crystalline heterogeneity. The orientation relationship between the parent and twin structures is consistent with activation of the (111) {112} deformation twinning mode. Ab initio generalized stacking fault energy curve calculations corresponding to (111){112} twinning shear suggest that the magnitude of the twinning partial is 4 1 (111){112} and results in the local formation of a metastable orthorhombic phase within the pseudo-twin. This work highlights the discrepancy between the deformation modes of ordered/disordered structures and promotes an increased awareness for the role that long-range chemical order plays in determining deformation modes.

AB In the Massively Parallel Computation (MPC) model, data is distributed across multiple processors, and we call an algorithm space-efficient if each machine has n(1-epsilon+o(1)) memory with a machine count of Omega(n(epsilon)).
   In this paper, we study the string edit distance problem in the MPC model, presenting both a new algorithm and lower-bound results. A space-efficient MPC algorithm computing the exact edit distance using O(n(epsilon)) communication rounds is known by updating the algorithm of Chowdhury and Ramachandran (SPAA 2008). A key contribution of our work is the introduction of the first space-efficient MPC algorithm, which uses subpolynomial number of rounds and provides an n(o(1))-approximation of edit distance, where.. denotes the length of the input strings.
   Further, we complement this algorithm with new lower-bound results. The Orthogonal Vector (O.V.) conjecture states that no truly subquadratic time algorithm exists for the Orthogonal Vector problem, and it follows directly from the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). Drawing inspiration from this, we propose the Strong O.V. Conjecture that posits that there is no space-efficient MPC algorithm capable of solving O.V. using n(epsilon-Omega(1)) communication rounds. The Strong O.V. conjecture has far-reaching consequences, yielding the first (or strengthened) lower bounds for a myriad of problems in the MPC model including graph diameter estimation, computing Frechet distance, longest common subsequence, and dynamic time warping. Via an MPC reduction from O.V. to edit distance, we give the first conditional lower bound for string edit distance in the MPC model showing that there does not exist any space-efficient, n(epsilon-Omega(1))-round MPC exact edit distance algorithm.

AB In an epidemic network, lags due to travel time between populations, latent period, and recovery period can significantly change the epidemic behavior and result in successive echoing waves of the spread between various population clusters. Moreover, external shocks to a given population can propagate to other populations within the network, potentially snowballing into waves of resurgent epidemics. The main objective of this study is to investigate the effect of time delay and small shocks/uncertainties on the linear susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) dynamics of epidemic networks. In this regard, the asymptotic stability of this class of networks is first studied, and then its performance loss due to small shocks/uncertainties is evaluated based on the notion of the \scrH 2 norm. It is shown that network performance loss is correlated with the structure of the underlying graph, intrinsic time delays, epidemic characteristics, and external shocks. This performance measure is then used to develop an optimal traffic restriction algorithm for network performance enhancement, resulting in reduced infection in the metapopulation. A novel epidemic-based centrality index is also defined to evaluate the impact of every subpopulation on network performance, and its asymptotic behavior is investigated. It is shown that for specific choices of parameters, the output of the epidemic-based centrality index converges to the results obtained by local or eigenvector centralities. Moreover, given that epidemic-based centrality depends on the epidemic properties of the disease, it may yield distinct node rankings as the disease characteristics slowly change over time or as different types of infections spread. This node interlacing phenomenon is not observed in other centralities that rely solely on network structure. This unique characteristic of epidemic-based centrality enables it to adjust to various epidemic features. The derived centrality index is then adopted to improve the network robustness against external shocks on the epidemic network. The numerical results, along with the theoretical expectations, highlight the role of time delay as well as small shocks in investigating the most effective methods of epidemic containment.

TI <i>Ab initio</i> calculation of nonequilibrium quasiparticle-phonon
   dynamics in superconductors
SO AVS QUANTUM SCIENCE

DT Article
ID GREENS-FUNCTION; TRANSPORT
AB Phonon-induced Cooper pair breaking, inciting nonequilibrium quasiparticle (QP) bursts, is known to deteriorate the performance of superconducting devices. However, a detailed understanding of QP-phonon dynamics is lacking due to the absence of a well-established theoretical framework. This paper presents a fully ab initio scheme of calculating nonequilibrium, polarization-dependent QP-phonon dynamics in superconductors. The authors find that with only an 8% deviation from the equilibrium phonon Bose-Einstein distribution, the resulting nonequilibrium QP population is 83 times larger than the equilibrium Fermi-Dirac distribution, and the longitudinal acoustic (LA) phonon polarization is most responsible for QP generation. The authors demonstrated that the qubit transition rate in Josephson junction-based transmon qubits is increased by orders of magnitude when taking these nonequilibrium distributions into account, compared to equilibrium distributions. This framework allows an in-depth exploration of nonequilibrium QP-phonon dynamics in various Josephson-junction-based superconducting devices. It paves the way for formulating advanced phonon shielding strategies to target the LA polarization, potentially leading to enhanced device performance, such as increased coherence time of transmon qubits or reduced thermal noise in cryogenics.

AB Liquid-vapor phase change in the presence of non -condensable gases is a classical problem, which continues to challenge continuum modeling. Here, we propose a new model based on the phase field method, which describes the dynamics of the non -condensable gas, phase change and flow simultaneously. The model is built by extending van der Waals and Korteweg's theory for phase -transforming mixtures. The model equations have fourth order partial differential operators which presents significant challenges to standard spatial discretization methods. In addition, the isentropic form of the model equations is not hyperbolic at the liquid-gas interface, which inhibits the direct application of most algorithms for systems of hyperbolic equations. We propose a novel numerical scheme based on Isogeometric Analysis and the Taylor-Galerkin method, and also implement a residual based discontinuity capturing scheme. We show numerical results, at micron length scales, to study the accuracy and stability of our algorithm. We study the flow of a shock wave past a liquid droplet to test our numerical algorithm when steep gradients are present in the solution. Finally, we use the model to study the problem of gas-vapor bubble collapse near a solid wall.

AB Scheduling generative-AI jobs in the edge computing environment faces multiple non-trivial challenges, including the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) dependency among tasks, the intrinsic intertwinement between task scheduling and model selection, and the dynamic unpredictable arrival of job DAGs. In this work, we capture all such challenges and formulate a non-linear integer program to optimize the long-term profit of the generative-AI service provider, i.e., service revenue of the admitted jobs minus system costs of executing the tasks contained in such job DAGs. This problem is NP-hard even in the offline setting. To solve it, we first reformulate it into an equivalent schedule selection problem using generated schedules to tackle complex constraints. Then, we design a new online scheduling method through the online primal-dual technique. Experimental results confirm that our approach can increase the total service profit by up to 41.2% compared to existing algorithms.

AB Large-scale nonlinear optimization problems arise in a variety of applications and often exhibit some structure, which can be exploited by the use of parallel decompositions to speed up the solution. We present a general problem formulation for structured optimization problems and apply the interior point method, outlining different approaches to parallelize the step computations using the Schur complement decomposition. The use of an iterative linear solver can boost performance, given an appropriate preconditioner for the Schur complement. We present an approach to use sparse factorizations from previous solver iterations as a preconditioner, and compare it to both an L-BFGS preconditioner and direct solution.

AB This study explores combustion of highly oxygenated fuel blends (glycerol/methanol, G/M) to mitigate carbon footprint using a novel fuel injector, called Swirl Burst (SB) injector. The recently developed SB injector yields fine droplets immediately rather than a breaking jet/film of conventional injectors. The advanced atomization resulted in ultra-clean combustion with high fuel flexibility even for viscous oils without fuel preheating. The present work investigates the effects of fuel composition and the atomizing air to liquid mass ratio (ALR) across the injector on the global combustion characteristics of G/M blends without fuel preheating in an uninsulated lab-scale combustor. Results show that the SB injection resulted in mainly clean lean-premixed and near complete combustion for the G/M mixes of 50/50, 60/40 and 70/30 by power with near-zero emissions of CO and NOx. Increase in ALR resulted in more radially distributed flames with slightly reduced flame lift-off height, with ultra-clean and near complete combustion for all the ALRs for the 50/50 and 70/30 blends. Clean and efficient G/M combustion without fuel preheating achieved by the fuel-flexible SB injection signifies the potential to combust crude glycerol - the largest oxygenated byproduct of biodiesel production - to enable biofuel cost effectiveness with near-zero emissions.

AB On-the-ground sample-based forest inventory methods have been the standard practice for more than a century, however, remote sensing technologies such as airborne laser scanning (ALS) are providing wall-to-wall inventories based on individual tree measurements. In this study, we assess the accuracy of individual tree height, diameter, and volume derived from field-cruising measurements and three ALS data-derived methods in a 1.1 ha stand using direct measurements acquired on felled trees and log-scale volume measurements. Results show that although height derived from indirect conventional field measurements and ALS were statistically equivalent to felled tree height measurements, ALS measured heights had lower root mean square error (RMSE) and bias. Individual tree diameters modeled using a height-to-diameter-at-breast-height model derived from local forest inventory data and the software ForestView had moderate RMSE (8.3-8.5 cm) and bias (-3.0 - -0.3 cm). The ALS-based methods underdetected trees but accounted for 78%-91% of the field reference harvested merchantable volume and 71%-99% of the merchantable volume scaled at the mill. The results also illustrate challenges of using mill-scaled volume estimates as validation data and highlight the need for more research in this area. Overall, the results provide key insights to forest managers on accuracies associated with conventional field-derived and ALS-derived individual tree inventories.Study Implications: Forest inventory data provide critical information for operational decisions and forest product supply chain planning. Traditionally, forest inventories have used field sampling of stand conditions, which is time-intensive and cost-prohibitive to conduct at large spatial scales. Remote sensing technologies such as airborne laser scanning (ALS) provide wall-to-wall inventories based on individual tree measurements. This study advances our understanding of the accuracy of conventional field-derived and ALS-derived individual tree inventories by evaluating these inventories with felled tree and log scaling data. The results provide key insights to forest managers on errors associated with conventional field and ALS-derived individual tree measurements.

AB The heart, which is the first organ to develop, is highly dependent on its form to function1,2. However, how diverse cardiac cell types spatially coordinate to create the complex morphological structures that are crucial for heart function remains unclear. Here we integrated single-cell RNA-sequencing with high-resolution multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization to resolve the identity of the cardiac cell types that develop the human heart. This approach also provided a spatial mapping of individual cells that enables illumination of their organization into cellular communities that form distinct cardiac structures. We discovered that many of these cardiac cell types further specified into subpopulations exclusive to specific communities, which support their specialization according to the cellular ecosystem and anatomical region. In particular, ventricular cardiomyocyte subpopulations displayed an unexpected complex laminar organization across the ventricular wall and formed, with other cell subpopulations, several cellular communities. Interrogating cell-cell interactions within these communities using in vivo conditional genetic mouse models and in vitro human pluripotent stem cell systems revealed multicellular signalling pathways that orchestrate the spatial organization of cardiac cell subpopulations during ventricular wall morphogenesis. These detailed findings into the cellular social interactions and specialization of cardiac cell types constructing and remodelling the human heart offer new insights into structural heart diseases and the engineering of complex multicellular tissues for human heart repair.
   Combining single-cell RNA-sequencing with high-resolution multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization reveals in detail the cellular interactions and specialization of cardiac cell types that form and remodel the human heart.

AB Sea surface temperature (SST) in the subpolar North Atlantic has significantly decreased at a rate of - 0.39 (+/-0.23) K/century during 1900-2020, which runs counter to global warming due to anthropogenic forcing. The cooling in the subpolar North Atlantic, known as the North Atlantic cold blob, could be driven by a host of mechanisms involving both the ocean and atmosphere. Here, we present evidence that changes in the atmospheric circulation over the North Atlantic, in particular a centennial trend towards a more positive phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), could have contributed to the cold blob. The positive NAO intensifies the surface wind over the subpolar North Atlantic and induces excessive heat loss from the air-sea interface. According to an idealized mixed layer heat balance model, the NAO induced heat loss alone cools the subpolar North Atlantic by 0.26 K/century, which explains 67% of the observed cold blob SST trend. The NAO-induced cooling is partially offset by the warming effect from the East Atlantic Pattern, and the net effect of changes in atmospheric circulation explains 44% of the observed cooling trend. Thus, besides ocean circulation, including the slowdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, the large-scale atmospheric circulation might have played an equally important role in prompting the century- long SST changes in the subpolar North Atlantic.

AB Subsurface oxygen in oxide-derived copper catalysts significantly influences CO2 activation. However, its effect on the molecular charging process, the key to forming the CO2 delta- intermediate, remains poorly understood. We employ many-body perturbation theory to investigate the impact of the structural factors induced by the subsurface oxygen on the charged activation of CO2. By computing the molecular single-particle state energy of the electron-accepting orbital on the Cu (111) surface, we examined how this molecular quasi-particle (QP) energy changes with the varying vicinity of adsorption and multiple-subsurface oxygen configuration. We demonstrate that subsurface oxygen impairs CO2 charging, with its presence and coverage being influential factors. However, we remark that density functional theory calculations do not predict such an excitation energy discrepancy induced by subsurface oxygen. The nonlocal potential proves to be substantial for accurate excitation energy predictions yet is not sensitive to minor atomic structural changes. More importantly, state delocalization and hybridization are critical for determining QP energy. These insights are enlightening for designing atomic architectures to optimize catalytic performance on modified surfaces.

TI New proxies for second-order cumulants of conserved charges in heavy-ion
   collisions within the EPOS4 framework
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW C
LA English
DT Article
ID QUARK-GLUON PLASMA; QUANTUM CHROMODYNAMICS; PERSPECTIVE
AB Proxies for cumulants of baryon number B, electric charge Q, and strangeness S are usually measured in heavy-ion collisions via moments of net-number distribution of given hadronic species. Since these cumulants of conserved charges are expected to be sensitive to the existence of a critical point in the phase diagram of nuclear matter, it is crucial to ensure that the proxies used as substitutes are as close to them as possible. Hence, we use the EPOS4 framework to generate Au + Au collisions at several collision energies of the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider beam energy scan. We compute second-order net cumulants of pi, K, and p, for which experimental data have been published as well as the corresponding conserved charge cumulants. We then compare them with proxies, defined in previous lattice QCD and hadron resonance gas model studies, which are shown to reproduce more accurately their associated conserved charge cumulants. We investigate the impact of hadronic rescatterings occurring in the late evolution of the system on these quantities, as well as the amount of signal actually originating from the bulk medium which endures a phase transition.

TI Overcoming low initial coulombic efficiencies of Si anodes through
   prelithiation in all-solid-state batteries
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS

ID LITHIUM-ION BATTERIES; COMPOSITE ANODES
AB All-solid-state batteries using Si as the anode have shown promising performance without continual solid-electrolyte interface (SEI) growth. However, the first cycle irreversible capacity loss yields low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of Si, limiting the energy density. To address this, we adopt a prelithiation strategy to increase ICE and conductivity of all-solid-state Si cells. A significant increase in ICE is observed for Li1Si anode paired with a lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) cathode. Additionally, a comparison with lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NCM) reveals that performance improvements with Si prelithiation is only applicable for full cells dominated by high anode irreversibility. With this prelithiation strategy, 15% improvement in capacity retention is achieved after 1000 cycles compared to a pure Si. With Li1Si, a high areal capacity of up to 10 mAh cm-2 is attained using a dry-processed LCO cathode film, suggesting that the prelithiation method may be suitable for high-loading next-generation all-solid-state batteries.
   All-solid-state batteries with silicon anodes have high capacities but low initial coulombic efficiencies (ICEs) because of first cycle irreversible capacity loss. Here, the authors report a prelithiation strategy to improve ICEs and reversibility.

AB Over 20 years ago, an adaptive, silent male morph called 'flatwing' was discovered in a population of Hawaiian crickets (Teleogryllus oceanicus). Silence protects males against lethal, eavesdropping parasitoid flies (Ormia ochracea). Since then, numerous independent, protective morphs have been discovered, including parallel 'flatwing' mutations, 'small-wing', ' curly-wing', 'rattling-wing', and 'defiledwing', all of which disrupt structures that generate sound when males rub their wings together. Some crickets also produce a protective, attenuated signal called ' purring'. This cricket-fly arms race is a microcosm of behavioral and evolutionary biology. Here we provide a user's guide to the system. Our research efforts have revealed an important role for behavioral flexibility (i.e., plasticity) in accommodating and accelerating genetic adaptation by enabling both sexes to cope with a changing social environment caused by adaptive signal loss. We describe a unique mode by which behavioral flexibility and novel adaptations are bound together in this system: as each one affects the fitness of the other in a way that facilitates rapid responses to selection, the two co- evolve over time. We advocate for viewing behavior's role in evolution as dynamic rather than static. Our research supports the idea that behavior can change dynamically depending on genetic architecture, demography, and other factors. In addition, the widespread reduction of singing through morphological rather than behavioral change in T. oceanicus pinpoints wing morphology as a hotspot of evolution, and we describe ongoing behavioral and genomic research characterizing this underappreciated mode of adaptation-adaptive breakage-which disrupts previously canalized form-function relationships.

ID CONTROLLABILITY; OBSERVABILITY; PLACEMENT
AB In this paper, we investigate the problem of time-varying sensor selection for linear time-invariant (LTI) dynamical systems. We develop a framework to design a sparse sensor schedule for a given large-scale LTI system with guaranteed performance bounds using a learning-based algorithm. We show how the observability Gramian matrix of an LTI system can be interpreted as the sum of rank-1 matrices indicating the contribution of the available sensors distributed in time. We then employ a regret minimization framework over density matrices to sparsify this sum of rank-1 matrices to approximate fully sensed LTI dynamics up to a multiplicative factor in some certain observability senses. Our main result provides a linear-sized (in dimension of system) sensor schedule that on the average activates only a constant number of sensors at each time step and significantly improves the previous linearithmic results. Our results naturally apply to the dual problem of actuator selection where a guaranteed approximation to the controllability Gramian will be provided.

ID DOMAIN ADAPTATION
AB Onboard sensors, such as cameras and thermal sensors, have emerged as effective alternatives to Global Positioning System (GPS) for geo-localization in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) navigation. Since GPS can suffer from signal loss and spoofing problems, researchers have explored camera-based techniques such as Visual Geo-localization (VG) using satellite RGB imagery. Additionally, thermal geo-localization (TG) has become crucial for long-range UAV flights in low-illumination environments. This paper proposes a novel thermal geo-localization framework using satellite RGB imagery, which includes multiple domain adaptation methods to address the limited availability of paired thermal and satellite images. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving reliable thermal geo-localization performance, even in thermal images with indistinct self-similar features. We evaluate our approach on real data collected onboard a UAV. We also release the code and Boson-nighttime, a dataset of paired satellite-thermal and unpaired satellite images for thermal geo-localization with satellite imagery. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to propose a thermal geo-localization method using satellite RGB imagery in long-range flights.

AB Selecting subsets of features that differentiate between two conditions is a key task in a broad range of scientific domains. In many applications, the features of interest form clusters with similar effects on the data at hand. To recover such clusters we develop DiSC, a data-driven approach for detecting groups of features that differentiate between conditions. For each condition, we construct a graph whose nodes correspond to the features and whose weights are functions of the similarity between them for that condition. We then apply a spectral approach to compute subsets of nodes whose connectivity pattern differs significantly between the condition-specific feature graphs. On the theoretical front, we analyze our approach with a toy example based on the stochastic block model. We evaluate DiSC on a variety of datasets, including MNIST, hyperspectral imaging, simulated scRNA-seq and task fMRI, and demonstrate that DiSC uncovers features that better differentiate between conditions compared to competing methods.

AB The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is the Milky Way ' s most massive satellite galaxy, which only recently (similar to 2 billion years ago) fell into our Galaxy. As stellar atmospheres preserve the composition of their natal cloud, the LMC ' s recent infall makes its most ancient, metal-deficient (' low-metallicity ') stars unique windows into early star formation and nucleosynthesis in a formerly distant region of the high-redshift universe. Here we present the elemental abundances of ten stars in the LMC with iron-to-hydrogen ratios ranging from similar to 1/300th to similar to 1/12,000th that of the Sun. Our most metal-deficient star is markedly more metal-deficient than any in the LMC with available detailed chemical abundance patterns and was probably enriched by a single extragalactic ' first-star ' supernova. This star lacks appreciable carbon enhancement, as does our overall sample, unlike the lowest-metallicity stars in the Milky Way. This and other abundance differences affirm that the extragalactic early LMC experienced diverging enrichment processes compared to the early Milky Way. Early element production, driven by the earliest stars, thus, appears to proceed in an environment-dependent manner.

AB Nowadays, the Global Positioning System (GPS) plays an critical role in providing navigational services for transportation and a variety of other location -dependent applications. However, the emergent threat of GPS spoofing attacks compromises the safety and reliability of these systems. In response, this study introduces a cutting -edge computer vision -based methodology, the SEquential dashcam-based vEhicle localization frameworK Plus (SEEK+), designed to counteract GPS spoofing. By analyzing dashcam footage to ascertain a vehicle's actual location, SEEK+ scrutinizes the authenticity of reported GPS data, effectively identifying spoofing incidents. The application of dashcam imagery for localization, however, presents inherent obstacles, such as adverse lighting and weather conditions, seasonal and temporal image variations, obstructions within the camera's field of view, and fluctuating vehicle velocities. To overcome these issues, SEEK+ integrates innovative strategies within its framework, demonstrating superior efficacy over existing approaches with a notable detection accuracy rate of up to 94%.

AB Learning analytics research increasingly studies classroom learning with AI-based systems through rich contextual data from outside these systems, especially student-teacher interactions. One key challenge in leveraging such data is generating meaningful insights into effective teacher practices. Quantitative ethnography bears the potential to close this gap by combining multimodal data streams into networks of co-occurring behavior that drive insight into favorable learning conditions. The present study uses transmodal ordered network analysis to understand effective teacher practices in relationship to traditional metrics of in-system learning in a mathematics classroom working with AI tutors. Incorporating teacher practices captured by position tracking and human observation codes into modeling significantly improved the inference of how efficiently students improved in the AI tutor beyond a model with tutor log data features only. Comparing teacher practices by student learning rates, we find that students with low learning rates exhibited more hint use after monitoring. However, after an extended visit, students with low learning rates showed learning behavior similar to their high learning rate peers, achieving repeated correct attempts in the tutor. Observation notes suggest conceptual and procedural support differences can help explain visit effectiveness. Taken together, offering early conceptual support to students with low learning rates could make classroom practice with AI tutors more effective. This study advances the scientific understanding of effective teacher practice in classrooms learning with AI tutors and methodologies to make such practices visible.

AB Civil war exhibits complex geospatial trends over time, which may be missed by models that rely on count-based operationalizations. Here, the spatial and temporal correlation values of monthly civil war events are transformed into their influence degree symbol, which measures geospatial concentration, spread, and intensity of civil war. We then measure variation in these degrees over time to identify relevant spatiotemporal civil war aspects. The network model is constructed using 0.5 degree grid locations as nodes, counting nearby and over time connections. We then extract the temporal community structure behind the data. We use ground-truth data to visualize how our measures correlate with observed patterns, thereby illustrating our method provides accurate depictions of geospatial civil war dynamics. We also evaluate the impact of several indicators highlighted by past research and our community-based spatiotemporal measures and comparing it to the preprocessed count indicator. Our findings indicate that the relationship between state capacity and climate stress show opposite correlations with civil war as those identified by studies that use count-based indicators. Counterintuitively, our results show that conflict intensifies and spreads in locations where the state is stronger and where climate conditions are improved.

AB Graph Transformer (GT) recently has emerged as a new paradigm of graph learning algorithms, outperforming the previously popular Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) on multiple benchmarks. Previous work (Kim et al., 2022) shows that with proper position embedding, GT can approximate MPNN arbitrarily well, implying that GT is at least as powerful as MPNN. In this paper, we study the inverse connection and show that MPNN with virtual node (VN), a commonly used heuristic with little theoretical understanding, is powerful enough to arbitrarily approximate the self-attention layer of GT. In particular, we first show that if we consider one type of linear transformer, the so-called Performer/Linear Transformer (Choromanski et al., 2020; Katharopoulos et al., 2020b), then MPNN + VN with only O(1) depth and O(1) width can approximate a self-attention layer in Performer/Linear Transformer. Next, via a connection between MPNN + VN and DeepSets, we prove the MPNN + VN with O(nd) width and O(1) depth can approximate the self-attention layer arbitrarily well, where d is the input feature dimension. Lastly, under some assumptions, we provide an explicit construction of MPNN + VN with O(1) width and O(n) depth approximating the self-attention layer in GT arbitrarily well. On the empirical side, we demonstrate that 1) MPNN + VN is a surprisingly strong baseline, outperforming GT on the recently proposed Long Range Graph Benchmark (LRGB) dataset, 2) our MPNN + VN improves over early implementation on a wide range of OGB datasets and 3) MPNN + VN outperforms Linear Transformer and MPNN on the climate modeling task.

AB The placenta is a valuable organ that can aid in understanding adverse events during pregnancy and predicting issues post-birth. Manual pathological examination and report generation, however, are laborious and resource-intensive. Limitations in diagnostic accuracy and model efficiency have impeded previous attempts to automate placenta analysis. This study presents a novel framework for the automatic analysis of placenta images that aims to improve accuracy and efficiency. Building on previous vision-language contrastive learning (VLC) methods, we propose two enhancements, namely Pathology Report Feature Recomposition and Distributional Feature Recomposition, which increase representation robustness and mitigate feature suppression. In addition, we employ efficient neural networks as image encoders to achieve model compression and inference acceleration. Experiments validate that the proposed approach outperforms prior work in both performance and efficiency by significant margins. The benefits of our method, including enhanced efficacy and deployability, may have significant implications for reproductive healthcare, particularly in rural areas or low- and middle-income countries.

AB Granular flows with solid particles play an important role in energy and catalysis applications. To predict their thermal performance, this study develops a comprehensive discrete particle tracking flow model fully coupled with conductive and radiative heat transfer. Leveraging the open -source software LIGGGHTS, our model uniquely integrates particle-particle and particle-wall thermal radiation for grey radiative surfaces. Models demonstrate the performance of: (a) plug flows of particles with a near -constant streamwise velocity and (b) gravity -driven, dense, moving beds of particles to determine wall -to -particle heat -transfer coefficients with heated, isothermal channel walls. The plug flow model is used to systematically interrogate the interdependent effects of flow -regime -dependent solid volume fractions (0.02-0.48), particle size (0.4-1 mm), operating wall temperatures (700-1300 K), and thermophysical particles properties including emissivity (0.1-1) and bulk thermal conductivity (0.16, 33 W/m/K). Key insights emerge regarding the interplay between flow physics, conduction, and radiation. The overall wall -to -particle and conductive heat -transfer coefficients increase with solid volume fraction, while radiation contribution decreases. For a fixed solid volume fraction, heat -transfer coefficients exhibit linear dependence on particle emissivity and cubic dependence on wall temperature, driven by enhanced thermal radiation. For a fixed mass flow rate of the solids, the dependence of radiative heat -transfer coefficient on particle size changes with solid volume fraction. To generalize and broaden the applicability of our results, heat -transfer coefficients are transformed into a dimensionless Nusselt number, and establish its dependence on solid volume fraction (0.02-0.55). These results reveal the high sensitivity of the overall Nusselt number to even small changes in solid volume fraction in the dense flow regime, particularly for the high -conductivity alumina particles. In contrast, the radiative Nusselt number only gradually changes and asymptotes for large solid volume fractions.

AB Despite the remarkable advancements in machine learning (ML) techniques for topology optimization, the predicted solutions often overlook the necessary structural connectivity required to meet the load-carrying demands of the resulting designs. Consequently, these predicted solutions exhibit subpar structural performance because disconnected components are unable to bear loads effectively and significantly compromise the manufacturability of the designs.In this paper, we propose an approach to enhance the topological accuracy of ML-based topology optimization methods by employing a predicted dual connectivity graph. We show that the tangency graph of the Maximal Disjoint Ball Decomposition (MDBD), which accurately captures the topology of the optimal design, can be used in conjunction with a point transformer network to improve the connectivity of the design predicted by Generative Adversarial Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks. Our experiments show that the proposed method can significantly improve the connectivity of the final predicted structures. Specifically, in our experiments the error in the number of disconnected components was reduced by a factor of 4 or more without any loss of accuracy. We demonstrate the flexibility of our approach by presenting examples including various boundary conditions (both seen and unseen), domain resolutions, and initial design domains. Importantly, our method can seamlessly integrate with other existing deep learning-based optimization algorithms, utilize training datasets with models using any valid geometric representations, and naturally extend to three-dimensional applications.

AB An optimal sequential experimental design approach is developed to computationally characterize soft material properties at the high strain rates associated with bubble cavitation. The approach involves optimal design and model inference. The optimal design strategy maximizes the expected information gain in a Bayesian statistical setting to design experiments that provide the most informative cavitation data about unknown soft material properties. We infer constitutive models by characterizing the associated viscoelastic properties from measurements via a hybrid ensemble-based 4D-Var method (En4D-Var). The inertial microcavitation-based high strain-rate rheometry (IMR) method (Estrada et al. J Mech Phys Solids 112:291-317, 2018) simulates the bubble dynamics under laser-induced cavitation. We use experimental measurements to create synthetic data representing the viscoelastic behavior of stiff and soft polyacrylamide hydrogels under realistic uncertainties. The synthetic data are seeded with larger errors than state-of-the-art measurements yet matches known material properties, reaching 1%\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$1\%$$\end{document} relative error within 10 sequential designs (experiments).

AB Data compression has become a crucial technique in addressing performance bottlenecks caused by increasing data volumes in High-Performance Computing (HPC), Big Data, and Deep Learning (DL). Despite its potential to boost system performance, recent studies have identified significant challenges with existing compression methods, mainly due to their high computational demands amidst continuously growing data sizes. Concurrently, the advent of Data Processing Units (DPUs), equipped with programmable System-on-Chip (SoC) and specialized compression accelerators, offers a promising opportunity to alter the landscape of data compression. This paper explores the complexities and potential of leveraging NVIDIA BlueField DPUs to accelerate lossy and lossless compression. Towards this, we introduce PEDAL, an innovative library that leverages the hardware capabilities of DPUs to unify and optimize data compression designs. Moreover, we seamlessly co-design PEDAL with the popular MPICH MPI library, demonstrating up to 101x speedup in compression time and 88x decrease in communication latency. Drawing on these achievements, we share our experience with various research communities about accelerating data compression on DPUs in communication-oriented HPC scenarios.

AB This paper presents a literature review on maintenance operations in the downstream petroleum industry. This process industry comprises facilities ranging from processing units to distribution networks, which makes the maintenance activities diverse. Maintenance optimization approaches from over 120 articles have been orga-nized into two broad categories. The first category implemented maintenance operations according to the crit-icality of equipment by applying methods like American Petroleum Institute, Analytical Hierarchy Process, and Failure Modes and Effect Analysis. The second category applied various optimal policies by adopting different tools such as mathematical models (probability, statistics, linear or nonlinear optimization methods, fuzzy logic), heuristic (metaheuristics) algorithms (genetic algorithm, firefly algorithm), data analytics (machine learning), and Internet of Things. The review also included maintenance implementation frameworks, planning & sched-uling methods, safety, mechanization, and evaluation procedures. It also tracks the recent trends in the main-tenance implementation approach, identifies gaps, and recommends future research directions.

AB Rapid acute heat stress assays are increasingly used to assess reef coral heat tolerance and identify resilient corals for research and restoration. However, concerns remain about (1) how representative they are of natural bleaching events, and (2) how reproducible they are in resolving differences in heat tolerance among corals. To address these gaps, we (1) compared rapid assays with an 8-day 'classic' bleaching experiment on Acropora pulchra genets (n = 20), and (2) tested and retested rapid assay responses of Acropora cervicornis (n = 85 genets) up to a year apart. In both species, rapid assays revealed a similar to 2.5 degrees C range in heat tolerance thresholds (F-v/F-m ED50s) among genets, and these thresholds were strongly predictive of individual bleaching responses in the classic bleaching experiment (R = 0.74). Retesting genets with rapid assays showed ED50 differences < 0.99 degrees C in 90% of cases (median = 0.47 degrees C), and controlling for environmental effects reduced these to < 0.54 degrees C (median = 0.23 degrees C). Even so, large differences (> 0.93 degrees C) were needed between two individual genets to reliably retest in the same rank order, though smaller margins were reproducible for groups (e.g., 0.29 degrees C for groups of 10). These results demonstrate that rapid assays may not resolve fine-scale individual heat tolerance differences, but they can easily identify top- and bottom-performing individuals, and differential tolerance between groups of corals. These findings provide critical validation and quantitative guidelines for the use of rapid assays, which may transform coral heat tolerance research and its applications to reef restoration.

AB Here, the radiation hardness of metal halide perovskite solar cells exposed to space conditions versus the effects of environmental degradation are assessed. The relative response of the constituent layers of the architecture to radiation is analyzed, revealing a general resilience of the structure when assessed across varying proton energy levels and fluences. However, despite the tolerance of the structure to irradiation, sensitivity to environmental degradation is observed during the transit of the device between the radiation and characterization facilities. Experimental evidence suggests the NiOx/perovskite interface is particularly sensitive to the effects of humidity and/or temperature exposure, while the irradiation of the devices appears to induce thermally activated annealing: improving the solar cells upon radiation exposure.

AB The weak stratospheric polar vortex (SPV) is usually linked to Northern Hemisphere cold spells. Based on the fifth generation of ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis and WACCM model experiments, we use K-means cluster analysis to extract the zonally asymmetric pattern of October-February stratospheric variability, which involves a stretched SPV and hence leads to cold surges in Northern Hemispheric mid-latitudes. There are contrasting effects and mechanisms between autumn (October-November) and late winter (February) SPV stretching events. In October, anomalies in the stratospheric circulation affect the near-surface 16-20 days after the weakening of the SPV. This contributes to a shift in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) towards its negative phase, leading to cold anomalies over northern Eurasia. Together with the weakening of planetary wave-1 during days 31-40, the second stratosphere-troposphere coupling strengthens the East Asian trough and the Siberian high, resulting in Eurasian high-latitude cooling. For November, the suppressed upward propagation of wave-1 during days 11-15 is conducive to anomalous high pressure over northern Europe and thereby European cooling through a stratospheric pathway, while for days 21-30, the weakening of propagating wave-2 over Eastern Europe intensifies the mid-latitude wave train through a tropospheric pathway, favorable for cold temperatures in mid-latitude East Asia. In contrast, the late winter SPV stretching events and the attendant Eurasian coldness during 11-25 days are likely to have been simultaneously driven by the long-lived European high anomaly, which enhanced the upward-propagating tropospheric waves into the stratosphere and thus favored SPV stretching. It indicates that the tropospheric pathway, rather than the stratospheric pathway, plays a dominant role in cold Eurasia following February SPV stretching events.

TI Theory of the ion-electron temperature relaxation rate in strongly
   magnetized plasmas
SO PHYSICS OF PLASMAS
LA English
DT Article
AB Recent works have shown that strongly magnetized plasmas characterized by having a gyrofrequency greater than the plasma frequency exhibit novel transport properties. One example is that the friction force on a test charge shifts, obtaining components perpendicular to its velocity in addition to the typical stopping power component antiparallel to its velocity. Here, we apply a recent generalization of the Boltzmann equation for strongly magnetized plasmas to calculate the ion-electron temperature relaxation rate. Strong magnetization is generally found to increase the temperature relaxation rate perpendicular to the magnetic field and to cause the temperatures parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field to not relax at equal rates. This, in turn, causes a temperature anisotropy to develop during the equilibration. Strong magnetization also breaks the symmetry of independence of the sign of the charges of the interacting particles on the collision rate, commonly known as the "Barkas effect." It is found that the combination of oppositely charged interaction and strong magnetization causes the ion-electron parallel temperature relaxation rate to be significantly suppressed, scaling inversely proportional to the magnetic field strength.

AB Online product reviews play a critical role for consumers to make a decision of product purchasing, and become an important data source for vendors to build recommendation systems. Some consumers won't even buy a product without reading online reviews first, and some vendors invite reviewers to write product reviews before a product is released to the market. However, the review quality could greatly impact the use of the reviews for supporting the purchase decision and recommendation. In order to produce enough high-quality reviews, it is a common practice that vendors provide incentives for writing product reviews. Current research is divided. Some research showed that incentive reviews could be more biased compared to organic reviews, but other scholars showed incentive reviews contain more useful information. Furthermore, other academic publications showed very different results regarding the differences between the incentivized and organic reviews. One of the reasons explaining the observation differences could be due to the quality of the reviewers and reviews. Therefore, it is necessary to control the quality of the reviewers and their reviews for a more objective comparison. In this research, we first discuss an approach for ensuring the quality of the data collection and processing to ensure the quality of the comparison study. Then, we explore the differences between incentivized reviews and organic reviews collected from a website that provides reviews for enterprise software systems. Several parameters of the reviews, such as the overall score, sentiment, and subjectivity of the reviews, were analyzed and compared. Our results could provide a reference for appropriately using reviews and managing the reviewing process.

AB The cooling effect of the ocean on the Southern California coastal zone is investigated using a high-resolution (4-km) gridded surface meteorological data set (gridMET) of daily maximum temperature (Tmax), with focus on summer mean conditions, taken as the July-August-September (JAS) average. An empirical orthogonal function analysis reveals a coastal mode of JAS temperature covariability, distinct from a more energetic inland mode, that captures Tmax averaged across the Southern California coastal plain. The coastal mode temperature correlates significantly with, and has similar amplitude to, regional sea surface temperature (SST). High (low) summer land and sea surface temperatures, as well as inversion layer temperature differences, are associated with decreases (increases) of northerly coastal wind speeds and coastal cloudiness. The number of extreme heat days on land increases as regional SST increases (4.3 days degrees C-1), with heat wave days 10 times more likely during peak warm versus cool coastal mode years. The coastal zone was notably warmer and heat wave days peaked during the well documented marine heat wave events of 2014/15 and 2018 off Southern California. The marine variability associated with the coastal mode also has strong expression off the Baja California peninsula, presumably due to strong covarying winds in that area. As in previous studies, higher ocean temperatures are attributed to weaker summer winds, with associated reductions in ocean surface heat loss, coastal upwelling, and cloudiness.

AB Like all conductive materials, electrically conductive metal-organic frameworks glean their properties from their defects. Owing to the synthesis conditions required to form the peak-performing triphenylene-based conductors, adatomic H atoms are likely the most prevalent defect and may occur in the charge state of -1, 0, and +1. However, some forms of these defects necessitate unpaired electrons, and the interplay between the ligand-centered unpaired electron and spin-polarized metals remains unknown. Here, we report the formation energies of hydrogenic defects in Cu-3(HITP)(2) (HITP equivalent to 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaiminotriphenylene), the Cu2+ analogue of Ni-3(HITP)(2), and show that they are comparable to the Ni2+ system. d(9) Cu2+ does not appreciably affect the electronic band properties of the defective framework.

AB Pioneer trees require high-light environments for successful seedling establishment. Consequently, seeds of these species often persist in the soil seed bank (SSB) for periods ranging from several weeks to decades. How they survive despite extensive pressure from seed predators and soil-borne pathogens remains an intriguing question.This study aims to test the hypotheses that decades-old seeds collected from the SSB in a lowland tropical forest remain viable by (i) escaping infection by fungi, which are major drivers of seed mortality in tropical soils, and/or (ii) maintaining high levels of seed dormancy and seed coat integrity when compared to inviable seeds.We collected seeds of Trema micrantha and Zanthoxylum ekmanii at Barro Colorado Island, Panama, from sites where adult trees previously occurred in the past 30 years. We used carbon dating to measure seed age and characterized seed coat integrity, seed dormancy and fungal communities.Viable seeds from the SSB ranged in age from 9 to 30 years for T. micrantha, and 5 to 33 years for Z. ekmanii. We found no evidence that decades-old seeds maintain high levels of seed dormancy or seed coat integrity. Fungi were rarely detected in fresh seeds (no soil contact), but phylogenetically diverse fungi were detected often in seeds from the SSB. Although fungal infections were more commonly detected in inviable seeds than in viable seeds, a lack of differences in fungal diversity and community composition between viable and inviable seeds suggested that viable seeds are not simply excluding fungal species to survive long periods in the SSB.Synthesis. Our findings reveal the importance of a previously understudied aspect of seed survival, where the impact of seed-microbial interactions may be critical to understand long-term persistence in the SSB.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.
   Los arboles pioneros requieren ambientes con mucha luz para el establecimiento exitoso de las plantulas. Por esta razon, las semillas de estas especies a menudo persisten en el banco de semillas en el suelo por periodos que van desde varias semanas hasta decadas. Como sobreviven en el suelo estas semillas a pesar de la gran presion de patogenos y depredadores sigue siendo una pregunta intrigante.Este estudio tiene como objetivo probar que semillas que sobreviven en el suelo por varias decadas en un bosque tropical de tierras bajas siguen siendo viables ya que: (i) escapan a la infeccion por hongos, que son el principal agente de mortalidad de semillas en suelos tropicales, y/o (ii) mantienen altos niveles de dormancia y dureza en la testa cuando son comparadas con semillas inviables o recientemente producidas.Colectamos semillas de Trema micrantha y Zanthoxylum ekmanii del suelo en la isla de Barro Colorado, Panama. Los lugares de colecta fueron escogidos, ya que previamente fueron ocupados por arboles adultos que murieron en un rango de tiempo que va desde 5 hasta 30 anos previos a la colecta de semillas. Usamos datacion por carbono para medir la edad de las semillas y caracterizamos la integridad de la testa, la proporcion de semillas dormantes y las comunidades de hongos que infectan las semillas en el suelo.Las semillas viables colectadas en el suelo tenian edades comprendidas entre 9 y 30 anos para T. micrantha y entre 5 y 33 anos para Z. ekmanii. No encontramos evidencia de que las semillas que llevan decadas viables en el suelo mantengan altos niveles de dormancia o integridad en la testa. Rara vez se detectaron hongos en semillas frescas (semillas que no han tenido contacto con el suelo), pero a menudo se detectaron hongos filogeneticamente diversos en semillas viables colectadas del suelo. Aunque las infecciones fungicas se detectaron con mayor frecuencia en semillas inviables que en semillas viables, la falta de diferencias en la diversidad de hongos y la composicion de la comunidad de hongos aislados de semillas viables e inviables sugiere que las semillas viables no excluyen la infeccion por hongos para sobrevivir durante largos periodos en el suelo.Sintesis. Nuestros hallazgos revelan la importancia de un aspecto previamente poco estudiado de la persistencia de semillas en el suelo, donde el impacto de las interacciones entre las semillas y los microorganismos del suelo pueden ser fundamentales para comprender la persistencia a largo plazo en el banco de semillas.

AB Melon (Cucumis melo) is an important crop grown worldwide. The diversity of aromatic volatiles melon fruits produce contributes to their diverse flavors. However, little is known about the chemical and molecular profiles essential for establishing the signature flavors in field conditions. Here we analyzed the metabolome and transcriptome of 10 melon varieties grown in the field in Weslaco, TX. Also, two cultivars (TTDV and F39) grown at seven locations in the US were studied further to understand how geographic conditions influence levels of metabolites and transcripts. The data obtained here were combined with sensory data, and the relationship between observed metabolites/transcripts and fruit quality QTL was evaluated. Overall, esters and lipid-derived metabolites varied significantly in different sample sets. TTDV variety was significantly enriched for esters, whereas honeydew varieties were for lipid-derived metabolites, separating their profiles from other varieties. Among transcripts associated with cultivar-specific metabolites, we identified several transcripts linked to QTLs responsible for the production of fruit metabolites, including benzyl alcohol O-benzoyltransferase (AAT2) and caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase 1-like. On the other hand, transcripts associated with location-specific metabolites did not produce a clear overlap with known fruit-quality QTLs, suggesting the presence of different regulatory systems for the environmental control of fruit metabolites.

ID AGENDA-SETTING FUNCTION; NEWS
AB Disinformation activities that aim to manipulate public opinion pose serious challenges to managing online platforms. One of the most widely used disinformation techniques is bot-assisted fake social engagement, which is used to falsely and quickly amplify the salience of information at scale. Based on agenda-setting theory, we hypothesize that bot-assisted fake social engagement boosts public attention in the manner intended by the manipulator. Leveraging a proven case of bot-assisted fake social engagement operation in a highly trafficked news portal, this study examines the impact of fake social engagement on the digital public's news consumption, search activities, and political sentiment. For that purpose, we used ground-truth labels of the manipulator's bot accounts, as well as real-time clickstream logs generated by ordinary public users. Results show that bot-assisted fake social engagement operations disproportionately increase the digital public's attention to not only the topical domain of the manipulator's interest (i.e., political news) but also to specific attributes of the topic (i.e., political keywords and sentiment) that align with the manipulator's intention. We discuss managerial and policy implications for increasingly cluttered online platforms.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E

DT Article
AB Multiphase field models have emerged as an important computational tool for understanding biological tissue while resolving single-cell properties. While they have successfully reproduced many experimentally observed behaviors of living tissue, the theoretical underpinnings have not been fully explored. We show that a twodimensional version of the model, which is commonly employed to study tissue monolayers, can be derived from a three-dimensional version in the presence of a substrate. We also show how viscous forces, which arise from friction between different cells, can be included in the model. Finally, we numerically simulate a tissue monolayer and find that intercellular friction tends to solidify the tissue.

AB As the data-driven decision process becomes dominating for industrial applications, fairness-aware machine learning arouses great attention in various areas. This work proposes fairness penalties learned by neural networks with a simple random sampler of sensitive attributes for non-discriminatory supervised learning. In contrast to many existing works that critically rely on the discreteness of sensitive attributes and response variables, the proposed penalty is able to handle versatile formats of the sensitive attributes, so it is more extensively applicable in practice than many existing algorithms. This penalty enables us to build a computationally efficient group-level in-processing fairness-aware training framework. Empirical evidence shows that our framework enjoys better utility and fairness measures on popular benchmark data sets than competing methods. We also theoretically characterize estimation errors and loss of utility of the proposed neural-penalized risk minimization problem.

AB The adaptive spectral Koopman (ASK) method was introduced to numerically solve autonomous dynamical systems that laid the foundation for numerous applications across different fields in science and engineering. Although ASK achieves high accuracy, it is computationally more expensive for multidimensional systems compared with conventional time integration schemes like Runge-Kutta. In this work, we combine the sparse grid and ASK to accelerate the computation for multidimensional systems. This sparse-grid-based ASK (SASK) method uses the Smolyak structure to construct multidimensional collocation points as well as associated polynomials that are used to approximate eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator of the system. In this way, the number of collocation points is reduced compared with using the tensor product rule. We demonstrate that SASK can be used to solve ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and partial differential equations (PDEs) based on their semidiscrete forms. Numerical experiments are illustrated to compare the performance of SASK and state-of-the-art ODE solvers.

AB Semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) can function as efficient gain materials with chemical versatility because of their surface ligands. Because the properties of NCs in solution are sensitive to ligand-environment interactions, local chemical changes can result in changes in the optical response. However, amplification of the optical response is technically challenging because of colloidal instability at NC concentrations needed for sufficient gain to overcome losses. This paper demonstrates liquid lasing from plasmonic lattice cavities integrated with ligand-engineered CdZnS/ZnS NCs dispersed in toluene and water. By taking advantage of calcium ion-induced aggregation of NCs in aqueous solutions, we show how lasing threshold can be used as a transduction signal for ion detection. Our work highlights how NC solutions and plasmonic lattices with open cavity architectures can serve as a biosensing platform for lab-on-chip devices.

AB In this work, a thorough assessment of the robustness of complementary channel HfO2 ferroelectric FET (FeFET) against total ionizing dose (TID) radiation is conducted, with the goal of determining its suitability for use as high-performance and energy-efficient embedded nonvolatile memory (eNVM) for space applications. We demonstrate that: i) ferroelectric HfO2 thin film is robust against X-ray and proton irradiation; ii) FeFET exhibits a polarization state dependent radiation sensitivity where the high-V-TH (HVT) state sees noticeable negative V-TH shift and low-V-TH (LVT) is immune to irradiation, irrespective of the channel type; iii) the state dependence is ascribed to the depolarization field in the HVT, which points toward the channel and facilitates the transport and trapping of radiation-generated holes close to the channel. In the future, radiation hardening techniques need to be considered.

AB Herein, we describe a general hydrodefunctionalization protocol of alcohols and amines through a common isonitrile intermediate. To cleave the relatively inert C-NC bond, we leveraged dual hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and photoredox catalysis to generate a nucleophilic boryl radical, which readily forms an imidoyl radical intermediate from the isonitrile. Rapid beta-scission then accomplishes defunctionalization. This method has been applied to the hydrodefunctionalization of both amine and alcohol-containing pharmaceuticals, natural products, and biomolecules. We extended this approach to the reduction of carbonyls and olefins to their saturated counterparts, as well as the hydrodecyanation of alkyl nitriles. Both experimental and computational studies demonstrate a facile beta-scission of the imidoyl radical, and reconcile differences in reactivity between nitriles and isonitriles within our protocol.
   We report a general hydrodefunctionalization protocol using isonitrile intermediates. Employing photoredox catalysis, a nucleophilic boryl radical mediates the scission of a relatively inert C-NC bond, accomplishing deletion of the isonitrile group. This strategy applies to the hydrodefunctionalization of both amine and alcohol-containing compounds and extends to the reduction of carbonyls, olefins, and alkyl nitriles. image

AB The alignment of striated intensity structures in thin neutral hydrogen (H i) spectroscopic channels with Galactic magnetic fields has been observed. However, the origin and nature of these striations are still debatable. Some studies suggest that the striations result solely from real cold-density filaments without considering the role of turbulent velocity fields in shaping the channel's intensity distribution. To determine the relative contribution of density and velocity in forming the striations in channel maps, we analyse synthetic observations of channel maps obtained from realistic magnetized multiphase H i simulations with thermal broadening included. We vary the thickness of the channel maps and apply the Velocity Decomposition Algorithm to separate the velocity and density contributions. In parallel, we analyse GALFA-H i observations and compare the results. Our analysis shows that the thin channels are dominated by velocity contribution, and velocity caustics mainly generate the H i striations. We show that velocity caustics can cause a correlation between unsharp-masked H i structures and far-infrared emission. We demonstrate that the linear H i fibers revealed by the Rolling Hough Transform (RHT) in thin velocity channels originate from velocity caustics. As the thickness of channel maps increases, the relative contribution of density fluctuations in channel maps increases and more RHT-detected fibers tend to be perpendicular to the magnetic field. Conversely, the alignment with the magnetic field is the most prominent in thin channels. We conclude that similar to the velocity channel gradients (VChGs) approach, RHT traces magnetic fields through the analysis of velocity caustics in thin channel maps.

TI Identification of key factors related to digital health observational
   study adherence and retention by data-driven approaches: an exploratory
   secondary analysis of two prospective longitudinal studies
SO LANCET DIGITAL HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID LIFE
AB Background Longitudinal digital health studies combine passively collected information from digital devices, such as commercial wearable devices, and actively contributed data, such as surveys, from participants. Although the use of smartphones and access to the internet supports the development of these studies, challenges exist in collecting representative data due to low adherence and retention. We aimed to identify key factors related to adherence and retention in digital health studies and develop a methodology to identify factors that are associated with and might affect study participant engagement. Methods In this exploratory secondary analysis, we used data from two separate prospective longitudinal digital health studies, conducted among adult participants (age >= 18 years) during the COVID-19 pandemic by the BIG IDEAs Laboratory (BIL) at Duke University (Durham, NC, USA; April 2, 2020 to May 25, 2021) and Evidation Health (San Mateo, CA, USA; April 4 to Aug 31, 2020). Prospective daily or weekly surveys were administered for up to 15 months in the BIL study and daily surveys were administered for 5 months in the Evidation Health study. We defined metrics related to adherence to assess how participants engage with longitudinal digital health studies and developed models to infer how demographic factors and the day of survey delivery might be associated with these metrics. We defined retention as the time until a participant drops out of the study. For the purpose of clustering analysis, we defined three metrics of survey adherence: (1) total number of surveys completed, (2) participation regularity (ie, frequency of filling out surveys consecutively), and (3) time of activity (ie, engagement pattern relative to enrolment time). We assessed these metrics and explored differences by age, sex, race, and day of survey delivery. We analysed the data by unsupervised clustering, survival analysis, and recurrent event analysis with multistate modelling, with analyses restricted to individuals who provided data on age, sex, and race. Findings In the BIL study, 5784 unique participants with the required demographic data completed 388 600 unique daily surveys (mean 67 [SD 90] surveys per participant). In the Evidation Health study, 89 479 unique participants with the required demographic data completed 2 080 992 unique daily surveys (23 [32] surveys per participant). Participants were grouped into adherence clusters based on the three metrics of adherence, and we identified statistically discernible differences in age, race, and sex between clusters. Most of the individuals aged 18-29 years were observed in the clusters with low or medium adherence, whereas the oldest age group (>= 60 years) was generally more represented in clusters with high adherence than younger age groups. For retention, survival analysis indicated that 18-29 years was the age group with the highest risk of exiting the study at any given point in time (BIL study, hazard ratio [HR] for 18-29 years vs >= 60 years, 1<middle dot>69 [95% CI 1<middle dot>53-1<middle dot>86; p<0<middle dot>0001]; Evidation Health study, HR 1<middle dot>50 [1<middle dot>47-1<middle dot>53; p<0<middle dot>0001]). Sex and race were not discernible predictors of retention in the BIL study.
   In the Evidation Health study, male participants (vs female participants; HR 0<middle dot>96 [0<middle dot>94-0<middle dot>98]; p<0<middle dot>0001) and White participants (vs Asian participants; HR 0<middle dot>96 [0<middle dot>93-0<middle dot>98; p=0<middle dot>0004) had a lower risk of study exit, and Other race participants (vs Asian participants) had a higher risk of study exit (HR 1<middle dot>10 [1<middle dot>06-1<middle dot>14; p<0<middle dot>0001]). Recurrent event analysis confirmed age as the factor most associated with adherence; for the 18-29 years age group (vs >= 60 years group), the transition intensity from an active to inactive state per day in the BIL study was 1<middle dot>661 (95% CI 1<middle dot>606-1<middle dot>718) and in the Evidation Health study was 1<middle dot>108 (1<middle dot>094-1<middle dot>121). Participation patterns were variable by race and sex between the studies. Interpretation Our analyses revealed that age was consistently associated with adherence and retention, with younger participants having lower adherence and higher dropout rates than older participants. Unsupervised clustering and survival analyses are established methods in this field, whereas the use of recurrent event analysis, was, to our knowledge, the first instance of the application of this method to remote digital health data. These methods can help to understand participant engagement in digital health studies, supporting targeted measures to improve adherence and retention.

AB While surface hopping has emerged as a powerful method for simulating non-adiabatic dynamics in large molecules, the ad hoc nature of the necessary velocity adjustments and decoherence corrections in the algorithm somewhat reduces its reliability. Here we propose a new scheme that eliminates these aspects by combining the nuclear equation from the quantum-trajectory surface-hopping approach with the electronic equation derived from the exact-factorization approach. The resulting method, denoted QTSH-XF, yields a surface-hopping method on firmer ground than previous and is shown to successfully capture dynamics in Tully models and in a linear vibronic coupling model of the photoexcited uracil cation.

AB Using phase-field simulations, we investigate the bulk coarsening dynamics of ternary polymer solutions undergoing a glass transition for two models of phase separation: diffusion only and with hydrodynamics. The glass transition is incorporated in both models by imposing mobility and viscosity contrasts between the polymer-rich and polymer-poor phases of the evolving microstructure. For microstructures composed of polymer-poor clusters in a polymer-rich matrix, the mobility and viscosity contrasts significantly hinder coarsening, effectively leading to structural arrest. For microstructures composed of polymer-rich clusters in a polymer-poor matrix, the mobility and viscosity contrasts do not impede domain growth; rather, they change the transient concentration of the polymer-rich phase, altering the shape of the discrete domains. This effect introduces several complexities to the coarsening process, including percolation inversion of the polymer-rich and polymer-poor phases-a phenomenon normally attributed to viscoelastic phase separation.

DE Social media networks; Multi-platform; Election
AB Understanding how social media users interact with each other and spread information across multiple platforms is critical for developing effective methods for promoting truthful information and disrupting misinformation, as well as accurately simulating multi-platform information diffusion. This work explores five approaches for identifying relationships between users involved in cross-platform information spread. We use a combination of user attributes and URL posting behaviors to find users who appear to purposely spread the same information over multiple platforms or transfer information to new platforms. To evaluate the outlined approaches, we apply them to a dataset of over 24M social media posts from Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, and Instagram relating to the 2020 U.S. presidential election. We then characterize and validate our results using null model analysis and the component structure of the user networks returned by each approach. We subsequently examine the political bias, fact ratings, and performance of the content posted by the identified sets of users. We find that the different approaches yield largely distinct sets of users with different biases and content preferences.

AB As the popularity of mobile devices continues to increase, Mobile Crowdsensing (MC), a scalable and efficient data collection method, has received widespread attention. Although lots of effort has been devoted to studying the task assignment or worker recruitment in MC, most of them focus on how to maximize the profit from the perspective of the platform while ignoring rational individual workers' entitlement. We creatively start from the worker's perspective to find the task selection strategy to maximize the worker's profit. In this paper, the problem of unknown task selection is modeled as a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB), on which three types of additional constraints are considered. The first constraint is the device budget. Workers choose and conduct tasks before it is exhausted. The second constraint is the personal preference regarding the traveling cost. The third constraint is the balance requirement of the MC platform, which has regulations on the tasks' execution rounds. In addition to the dilemma between exploration and exploitation in the classical MAB, we have to face the tradeoff between the reward and all the constraints above. To this end, we first adopt the epoch-style algorithm to reduce the number of switches between any two sensing tasks and further build new algorithms to deal with different constraints. The traveling cost and platform balance are involved in the task index computation as a penalty. We conduct extensive simulations based on real-world traces to verify the significant performance of our proposed algorithms.

AB The high-temperature superconducting cuprates host unidirectional spin- and charge- density-wave orders that can intertwine with superconductivity in nontrivial ways. While the charge components of these stripes have now been observed in nearly all cuprate families, their detailed evolution with doping varies across different materials and at high and low temperatures. We address this problem using nonperturbative determinant quantum Monte Carlo calculations for the three-band Hubbard model. Using an efficient implementation, we can resolve the model's fluctuating spin and charge modulations and map their evolution as a function of the charge transfer energy and doping. We find that the incommensurability of the charge modulations is decoupled from the spin modulations and decreases with hole doping, consistent with experimental measurements at high temperatures. These findings support the proposal that the high-temperature charge correlations are distinct from the intertwined stripe order observed at low-temperature and in the single-band Hubbard model.

AB It has been challenging to determine how a ligand that binds to a receptor activates downstream signaling pathways and to predict the strength of signaling. The challenge is compounded by functional selectivity, in which a single ligand binding to a single receptor can activate multiple signaling pathways at different levels. Spectroscopic studies show that in the largest class of cell surface receptors, 7 transmembrane receptors (7TMRs), activation is associated with ligand-induced shifts in the equilibria of intracellular pocket conformations in the absence of transducer proteins. We hypothesized that signaling through the mu opioid receptor, a prototypical 7TMR, is linearly proportional to the equilibrium probability of observing intracellular pocket conformations in the receptor-ligand complex. Here, we show that a machine learning model based on this hypothesis accurately calculates the efficacy of both G protein and beta-arrestin-2 signaling. Structural features that the model associates with activation are intracellular pocket expansion, toggle switch rotation, and sodium binding pocket collapse. Distinct pathways are activated by different arrangements of the ligand and sodium binding pockets and the intracellular pocket. While recent work has categorized ligands as active or inactive (or partially active) based on binding affinities to two conformations, our approach accurately computes signaling efficacy along multiple pathways.

AB The application of high-throughput sequencing to phylogenetic analyses is allowing authors to reconstruct the true evolutionary history of species. This work can illuminate specific mechanisms underlying divergence when combined with analyses of gene flow, recombination and selection. We conducted a phylogenomic analysis of Catharus, a songbird genus with considerable potential for gene flow, variation in migratory behaviour and genomic resources. We documented discordance among trees constructed for mitochondrial, autosomal and sex (Z) chromosome partitions. Two trees were recovered on the Z. Both trees differed from the autosomes, one matched the mitochondria, and the other was unique to the Z. Gene flow with one species likely generated much of this discordance; substantial admixture between ustulatus and the remaining species was documented and linked to at least two historic events. The tree unique to the Z likely reflects the true history of Catharus; local genomic analyses recovered the same tree in autosomal regions with reduced admixture and recombination. Genes previously connected to migration were enriched in these regions suggesting transitions between migratory and non-migratory states helped generate divergence. Migratory (vs. nonmigratory) Catharus formed a monophyletic clade in a subset of genomic regions. Gene flow was elevated in some of these regions suggesting adaptive introgression may have occurred, but the dominant pattern was of balancing selection maintaining ancestral polymorphisms important for olfaction and perhaps, by extension, adaptation to temperate climates. This work illuminates the evolutionary history of an important model in speciation and demonstrates how differential resistance to gene flow can affect local genomic patterns.

AB Nonlinear light-matter interactions are typically enhanced by increasing the local field and its interaction time with matter. Conventional methods to achieve these goals are based on resonances or slow-light effects. However, these methods suffer from various issues including narrow operational bandwidths, large footprints, and material absorption. An interesting alternative approach to enhance the local field is offered by nonreciprocal systems: by blocking the path of a unidirectional wave in a terminated nonreciprocal waveguiding structure, broadband electromagnetic fields can be drastically enhanced and localized near the termination. This approach was previously studied only in three-dimensional gyrotropic material platforms, where the need for external magnets and bulky materials makes it less practical. Here, instead, we employ a magnet-free mechanism to break reciprocity in 2D plasmonic materials, e.g., graphene. Specifically, we employ high-speed drifting electrons on a voltage-biased graphene sheet to lift the forward/backward degeneracy of the surface plasmon-polariton dispersion, creating modes with different propagation properties parallel and antiparallel to the current. We show that controllable, asymmetric, and intense field hot-spots are generated at the edges of a suitably terminated graphene metasurface. We then theoretically demonstrate that such asymmetric field hot-spots offer an effective solution to enhance third-order nonlinear optical effects. As an example, we predict that, using realistic values of drift velocity, high third-harmonic conversion efficiencies of up to 0.3% are achievable around the plasmon resonance frequencies.

AB Buildings produce a significant share of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, making homes and businesses a major factor in climate change. To address this critical challenge, this paper explores achieving net-zero emission through the carbon-aware optimal scheduling of the multi-energy building integrated energy systems (BIES). We integrate advanced technologies and strategies, such as the carbon capture system (CCS), power-to-gas (P2G), carbon tracking, and emission allowance trading, into the traditional BIES scheduling problem. The proposed model enables accurate accounting of carbon emissions associated with building energy systems and facilitates the implementation of low-carbon operations. Furthermore, to address the challenge of accurately assessing uncertainty sets related to forecasting errors of loads, generation, and carbon intensity, we develop a learning-based robust optimization approach for BIES that is robust in the presence of uncertainty and guarantees statistical feasibility. The proposed approach comprises a shape learning stage and a shape calibration stage to generate an optimal uncertainty set that ensures favorable results from a statistical perspective. Numerical studies conducted based on both synthetic and real-world datasets have demonstrated that the approach yields up to 8.2% cost reduction, compared with conventional methods, in assisting buildings to robustly reach net-zero emissions.

AB Power semiconductor devices are utilized as solid-state switches in power electronics systems, and their overarching design target is to minimize the conduction and switching losses. However, the unipolar figure-of-merit (FOM) commonly used for power device optimization does not directly capture the switching loss. In this Perspective paper, we explore three interdependent open questions for unipolar power devices based on a variety of wide bandgap (WBG) and ultra-wide bandgap (UWBG) materials: (1) What is the appropriate switching FOM for device benchmarking and optimization? (2) What is the optimal drift layer design for the total loss minimization? (3) How does the device power loss compare between WBG and UWBG materials? This paper starts from an overview of switching FOMs proposed in the literature. We then dive into the drift region optimization in 1D vertical devices based on a hard-switching FOM. The punch-through design is found to be optimal for minimizing the hard-switching FOM, with reduced doping concentration and thickness compared to the conventional designs optimized for static FOM. Moreover, we analyze the minimal power loss density for target voltage and frequency, which provides an essential reference for developing device- and package-level thermal management. Overall, this paper underscores the importance of considering switching performance early in power device optimization and emphasizes the inevitable higher density of power loss in WBG and UWBG devices despite their superior performance. Knowledge gaps and research opportunities in the relevant field are also discussed.

AB Context. The redshifted 21 cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) directly probes the ionization and thermal states of the intergalactic medium during that period. In particular, the distribution of the ionized regions around the radiating sources during EoR introduces scale-dependent features in the spherically averaged EoR 21 cm signal power spectrum. Aims. The goal is to study these scale-dependent features at different stages of reionization using numerical simulations and to build a source model-independent framework to probe the properties of the intergalactic medium using EoR 21 cm signal power spectrum measurements. Methods. Under the assumption of high spin temperature, we modeled the redshift evolution of the ratio of the EoR 21 cm brightness temperature power spectrum to the corresponding density power spectrum using an ansatz consisting of a set of redshift and scale-independent parameters. This set of eight parameters probes the redshift evolution of the average ionization fraction and the quantities related to the morphology of the ionized regions. Results. We tested this ansatz on different reionization scenarios generated using different simulation algorithms and found that it is able to recover the redshift evolution of the average neutral fraction within an absolute deviation less than or similar to 0.1. Conclusions. Our framework allows us to interpret 21 cm signal power spectra in terms of parameters related to the state of the IGM. This source model-independent framework is able to efficiently constrain reionization scenarios using multi-redshift power spectrum measurements with ongoing and future radio telescopes such as LOFAR, MWA, HERA, and SKA. This will add independent information regarding the EoR IGM properties.

TI Fermi surface of the magnetic kagome compound GdV 6 Sn 6 investigated
   using de Haas-van Alphen oscillations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
LA English
DT Article
ID METALS
AB The shape of the Fermi surface, and the cyclotron effective mass of the kagome magnet GdV 6 Sn 6 charge carriers are investigated using de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) oscillation measurements and electronic band structure calculations. The temperature- and angle -dependent torque magnetometry measurements revealed at least nine different frequencies ranging from - 10 T up to - 9000 T. These frequencies correspond to extremal areas of the Fermi surface ranging from - 0 . 2% up to 50% of the first Brillouin zone, qualitatively consistent with the electronic band structure calculations. The angle -dependent dHvA oscillation frequencies indicate that the smaller pockets of the Fermi surface have an almost three-dimensional character whereas the bigger pockets of the Fermi surface are mostly two dimensional. We also find evidence of the presence of light [0 . 28(1) m 0 ] as well as heavy [2 . 37(18) m 0 ] charge carriers through the analysis of the temperature dependence of dominant frequencies. The comparison of the observed frequencies with the electronic band structure calculations indicates that the heavy masses correspond to saddle-point-like features of electronic band structure at the M point. The observation of the multiple low frequencies and the calculated contributions from various bands to such low frequencies prevent the estimation of the topological nature of bands containing lighter fermions. In conclusion, our work reveals the features of a Fermi surface containing enhanced mass fermions originating from saddle points in the electronic band structure at the M point, which is inherent to kagome lattices.

AB The abundance and environmental friendliness in nature of sulfur (S) make Li-S batteries more attractive in addition to the high theoretical capacity (1675 mAh g-1) and energy density (2600 Wh kg-1) of the batteries. In this study, a bio-based S cathode with graphene (Gr) coating, capable of effectively suppressing the shuttle effect of polysulfides, is enabled via networking soy protein (SP) and polydopamine (PDA) to form a functional bio-binder (SP-PDA). Dopamine self-polymerization in SP not only generates the interpenetrated network for the bio-binder but also makes the denatured structure of SP with rich functional groups effective for trapping polysulfides. Meanwhile, the Gr coating with low impedance, and high electronic and ionic conductivity on the cathode surface further significantly reduces polysulfide dissolution. Consequently, the Li-S batteries with the bio-cathode (SP-PDA@Gr) demonstrate excellent rate performance and long cycling capacity. In specific, under the current density of 0.5 A g-1 at 70% (500 mAh g-1) capacity retention, the cycle life of the Li-S cell with SP-PDA@Gr cathode is 600 cycles, i.e.,100 times longer than that of the cell with PVDF binder. This study provides a sustainable strategy for enhancing the performance of Li-S batteries through networking natural proteins to form functional bio-binders.

AB Accurate geo-localization of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is crucial for outdoor applications including search and rescue operations, power line inspections, and environmental monitoring. The vulnerability of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) signals to interference and spoofing necessitates the development of additional robust localization methods for autonomous navigation. Visual Geo-localization (VG), leveraging onboard cameras and reference satellite maps, offers a promising solution for absolute localization. Specifically, Thermal Geo-localization (TG), which relies on image-based matching between thermal imagery with satellite databases, stands out by utilizing infrared cameras for effective nighttime localization. However, the efficiency and effectiveness of current TG approaches, are hindered by dense sampling on satellite maps and geometric noises in thermal query images. To overcome these challenges, we introduce STHN, a novel UAV thermal geo-localization approach that employs a coarse-to-fine deep homography estimation method. This method attains reliable thermal geo-localization within a 512-meter radius of the UAV's last known location even with a challenging 11% size ratio between thermal and satellite images, despite the presence of indistinct textures and self-similar patterns. We further show how our research significantly enhances UAV thermal geo-localization performance and robustness against geometric noises under low-visibility conditions in the wild.

AB The strong impact of the strain-induced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (SIDMI) on the magnetization dynamics of skyrmions in nanomagnetic structures is demonstrated. The effects of SIDMI are characterized by skyrmion equations (SEs) of motion and magnetoelastic (ME) equations. The study is performed on a model system of MgO/CoFe/Pt stacked on a piezoelectric substrate. The results demonstrate a major nonlinear amplification in both the first- and higher-harmonic magnitudes of the skyrmion breathing mode due to SIDMI. Remarkably, this enhancement can trigger a skyrmion collapse, enabling its deletion with ultraweak strain- induced excitations. The SIDMI effect is shown to be much more significant than the conventional ME effect. These findings open different avenues for the efficient manipulation of nanomagnetic structures through strain.

AB A systematic theoretical study of dopants in a half-delithiated lithium nickel oxide (Li0.5NiO2) cathode is performed to determine the preferred occupation sites, dopant ion migration, and suppression of oxygen evolution. Dopants considered include Li, B, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, Ge, As, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, In, Sn, Sb, La, Ce, Ta, and W. For the nontransition metal dopants, the energy barrier governing dopant migration is correlated with the number of valence shell electrons so that it increases from left to right across a row of the periodic table. For these dopants, the energy barrier also decreases moving down a column of the periodic table. For transition metal dopants, the energy barrier depends on the number of unpaired valence electrons of the dopant, so that the energy barrier is maximum near the middle of a transition metal row. Oxygen stability is studied by calculating the gap between O-2p and Ni-3d band centers. Most dopants that prefer occupying octahedral sites in the transition metal layer bring higher oxygen stability. In particular, oxygen stability is enhanced mostly by Mo, Sb, and W doping.

AB Acetic acid is industrially produced by methanol carbonylation using Ir- or Rh-based homogeneous catalysts and a corrosive HI promoter. Recently, a heterogeneous catalyst with atomically dispersed ReO4 sites on an inert mesoporous SBA-15 support demonstrated high acetic acid yields and stability without the need for a promoter (J. Qi, J. Finzel, H. Robatjazi, M. Xu, A. S. Hoffman, S. R. Bare, X. Pan and P. Christopher, Selective methanol carbonylation to acetic acid on heterogeneous atomically dispersed ReO4/SiO2 catalysts, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2020, 142(33), 14178-14189, https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.0c05026). In this study, we investigate the reaction mechanisms of methanol carbonylation on monopodal -ORe( 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 11111111 00000000 11111111 00000000 00000000 00000000 O)3 sites using density functional theory calculations, natural bond orbital analysis, and the energetic span model. We find that the reduction of dispersed Re(vii) oxide by CO through an indirect mechanism is essential for catalyst activation. The C-C coupling of methyl and carbonyl ligands is favorable in both Re(v) and Re(iii) complexes, with Re(iii) being superior due to transition state stabilization by a metal-localized lone electron pair. The preceding C-O bond activation is favorable only on Re(v) and leads to a thermodynamic sink, posing challenges in interpreting the high carbonylation activity in terms of monopodal ReOx site catalysis. We hypothesize that multi-nuclear sites or more exotic ligand environments drive the cooperative reaction mechanism of selective carbonylation.

AB Biobased, DNA delivery vectors have been synthesized with a core motif composed of 2,5-bishydroxymethylfuran (BHMF) readily available from an important biomass feedstock 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF). To generate the product, BHMF was first converted to 2,5-furan bishydroxymethyl diacrylate (2,5-FDA), which was later conjugated with different types of secondary amines. Rich in tertiary nitrogen, these oligomeric FDA-amino esters demonstrated stable electrostatic interactions with negatively charged plasmid DNA in an aqueous environment. We evaluated synthetic routes toward these plasmid DNA-binding amino esters (pFASTs), identified their nanoscale features, and attempted to establish their structure-property relationship in the context of the DNA delivery. Our preliminary studies show that the pFASTs formed stable complexes with the plasmid DNA. Dynamic light scattering indicated that the DNA polyplexes of pFASTs have hydrodynamic diameters within the size range of 100-150 nm with a surface charge (zeta-potential) ranging from -10 to +33 mV, depending on pFAST type. These oligomeric amino esters rich in furan motif were also found to successfully transfect the GFP-expressing plasmid DNA intracellularly. Collectively, this study establishes a new route to produce DNA transfection agents from sustainable resources that can be used for transferring genetic materials for humans, veterinary, and agrochemical purposes.
   Derived from furan diacrylate, the first examples of biobased gene transfection agents.

AB Multiphase compressible flows are often characterized by a broad range of space and time scales, entailing large grids and small time steps. Simulations of these flows on CPU-based clusters can thus take several wall-clock days. Offloading the compute kernels to GPUs appears attractive but is memory-bound for many finite-volume and-difference methods, damping speedups. Even when realized, GPU-based kernels lead to more intrusive communication and I/O times owing to lower computation costs. We present a strategy for GPU acceleration of multiphase compressible flow solvers that addresses these challenges and obtains large speedups at scale. We use OpenACC for directive-based offloading of all compute kernels while maintaining low-level control when needed. An established Fortran preprocessor and metaprogramming tool, Fypp, enables otherwise hidden compile-time optimizations. This strategy exposes compile-time optimizations and high memory reuse while retaining readable, maintainable, and compact code. Remote direct memory access realized via CUDA-aware MPI and GPUDirect reduces halo-exchange communication time. We implement this approach in the open-source solver MFC [1]. Metaprogramming results in an 8-times speedup of the most expensive kernels compared to a statically compiled program, reaching 46% of peak FLOPs on modern NVIDIA GPUs and high arithmetic intensity (about 10 FLOPs/byte). In representative simulations, a single NVIDIA A100 GPU is 7-times faster compared to an Intel Xeon Cascade Lake (6248) CPU die, or about 300-times faster compared to a single such CPU core. At the same time, near-ideal (97%) weak scaling is observed for at least 13824 GPUs on OLCF Summit. A strong scaling efficiency of 84% is retained for an 8-times increase in GPU count. Collective I/O, implemented via MPI3, helps ensure the negligible contribution of data transfers (< 1% of the wall time for a typical, large simulation). Large many-GPU simulations of compressible (solid-)liquid-gas flows demonstrate the practical utility of this strategy.

AB We present a surface-accelerated string method (SASM) to efficiently optimize low-dimensional reaction pathways from the sampling performed with expensive quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) Hamiltonians. The SASM accelerates the convergence of the path using the aggregate sampling obtained from the current and previous string iterations, whereas approaches like the string method in collective variables (SMCV) or the modified string method in collective variables (MSMCV) update the path only from the sampling obtained from the current iteration. Furthermore, the SASM decouples the number of images used to perform sampling from the number of synthetic images used to represent the path. The path is optimized on the current best estimate of the free energy surface obtained from all available sampling, and the proposed set of new simulations is not restricted to being located along the optimized path. Instead, the umbrella potential placement is chosen to extend the range of the free energy surface and improve the quality of the free energy estimates near the path. In this manner, the SASM is shown to improve the exploration for a minimum free energy pathway in regions where the free energy surface is relatively flat. Furthermore, it improves the quality of the free energy profile when the string is discretized with too few images. We compare the SASM, SMCV, and MSMCV using 3 QM/MM applications: a ribozyme methyltransferase reaction using 2 reaction coordinates, the 2 '-O-transphosphorylation reaction of Hammerhead ribozyme using 3 reaction coordinates, and a tautomeric reaction in B-DNA using 5 reaction coordinates. We show that SASM converges the paths using roughly 3 times less sampling than the SMCV and MSMCV methods. All three algorithms have been implemented in the FE-ToolKit package made freely available.

AB We present a population of 11 of the faintest (>25.5 AB mag) short gamma-ray burst (GRB) host galaxies. We model their sparse available observations using the stellar population inference code Prospector-beta and develop a novel implementation to incorporate the galaxy mass-radius relation. Assuming these hosts are randomly drawn from the galaxy population and conditioning this draw on their observed flux and size in a few photometric bands, we determine that these hosts have dwarf galaxy stellar masses of 7.0 less than or similar to log(M-*/M-circle dot)less than or similar to 9.1 . This is striking as only 14% of short GRB hosts with previous inferred stellar masses had M- * less than or similar to 109 M-circle dot. We further show these short GRBs have smaller physical and host-normalized offsets than the rest of the population, suggesting that the majority of their neutron star (NS) merger progenitors were retained within their hosts. The presumably shallow potentials of these hosts translate to small escape velocities of similar to 5.5-80 km s(-1), indicative of either low postsupernova systemic velocities or short inspiral times. While short GRBs with identified dwarf host galaxies now comprise approximate to 14% of the total Swift-detected population, a number are likely missing in the current population, as larger systemic velocities (observed from the Galactic NS population) would result in highly offset short GRBs and less secure host associations. However, the revelation of a population of short GRBs retained in low-mass host galaxies offers a natural explanation for the observed r-process enrichment via NS mergers in Local Group dwarf galaxies, and has implications for gravitational-wave follow-up strategies.

AB In this paper, we derive a new method based on the martingale theory to analyse the end-to-end (E2E) delay of multi-hop wireless links (MWL). First, the arrival-martingales and service-martingales are constructed in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) domain where fading channel characteristics are easily incorporated into the node's service. Then, a martingale parameter called the joint service descriptor is proposed to reflect the joint service capability of MWL for a specific arrival flow. Based on the above, we decouple the joint service and total delay threshold of MWL, which transforms the complex E2E delay analysis into the simple delay analysis of all single nodes. Finally, a closed-form expression for the E2E delay violation probability bounds is derived. Simulation results verify the accuracy and generality of our derived method in E2E delay analysis.

AB The introduction of degradable units into the backbone of commodity vinyl polymers represents a major opportunity to address the societal challenge of plastic waste and polymer recycling. Previously, we reported the facile copolymerization of alpha-lipoic acid derivatives containing 1,2-dithiolane rings with vinyl monomers leading to the incorporation of degradable S-S disulfide bonds along the backbone at relatively high dithiolane monomer feed ratios. To further enhance the recyclability of these systems, here we describe a facile and user-friendly strategy for backbone degradation at significantly lower dithiolane loading levels through cleavage of both S-S and S-C backbone units. Copolymers of n-butyl acrylate (nBA) or styrene (St) with small amounts of either alpha-lipoic acid (LA) or ethyl lipoate (ELp) dissolved in DMF were observed to undergo efficient degradation when heated at 100 degrees C under air. For example, at only 5 mol% ELp, a high molecular weight poly(ELp-co-nBA) (Mn = 62 kg mol-1) degraded to low molecular weight oligomers (Mn = 3.2 kg mol-1) by simple heating in DMF. In contrast, extended heating of either poly(nBA) or poly(St) homopolymers under the same conditions did not lead to any change in molecular weight or cleavage of the C-C backbone. This novel approach allows for the effective degradation of vinyl-based polymers with negligible impact on properties and performance due to the low levels of dithiolane incorporation.

AB Each view of our environment captures only a subset of our immersive surroundings. Yet, our visual experience feels seamless. A puzzle for human neuroscience is to determine what cognitive mechanisms enable us to overcome our limited field of view and efficiently anticipate new views as we sample our visual surroundings. Here, we tested whether memory-based predictions of upcoming scene views facilitate efficient perceptual judgments across head turns. We tested this hypothesis using immersive, head-mounted virtual reality (VR). After learning a set of immersive real-world environments, participants (n = 101 across 4 experiments) were briefly primed with a single view from a studied environment and then turned left or right to make a perceptual judgment about an adjacent scene view. We found that participants' perceptual judgments were faster when they were primed with images from the same (vs. neutral or different) environments. Importantly, priming required memory: it only occurred in learned (vs. novel) environments, where the link between adjacent scene views was known. Further, consistent with a role in supporting active vision, priming only occurred in the direction of planned head turns and only benefited judgments for scene views presented in their learned spatiotopic positions. Taken together, we propose that memory-based predictions facilitate rapid perception across large-scale visual actions, such as head and body movements, and may be critical for efficient behavior in complex immersive environments.

AB The photocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (pNRR) for ammonia (NH3) 3 ) production is often discussed as a sustainable alternative to the thermocatalytic Haber-Bosch process. One of the main challenges in pNRR research is the lack of reliable detection of photochemically produced NH3 3 since NH3 3 concentrations are often low and nitrogen-containing impurities may be present. Here, we identify three key sources of contamination (feed gases, catalyst precursors, and hole scavengers) and systematically quantify and reduce the contamination. We developed a custom photoreactor setup to minimize contamination and benchmarked three photo- catalysts previously reported to be active toward pNRR. Our results indicate that the pNRR rates of all three catalysts under benchmarking conditions are much lower than previously reported and in some cases have negligible activity. We suggest essential control experiments to contribute to the standardization of NH3 3 measurements in the pNRR field and to help the field elucidate the photoactivity of catalysts toward pNRR.

TI How do annotations affect Java code readability?

DE Code annotations; Program comprehension; Code readability; Software

AB ContextCode annotations have gained widespread popularity in programming languages, offering developers the ability to attach metadata to code elements to define custom behaviors. Many modern frameworks and APIs use annotations to keep integration less verbose and located nearer to the corresponding code element. Despite these advantages, practitioners' anecdotal evidence suggests that annotations might negatively affect code readability.ObjectiveTo better understand this effect, this paper systematically investigates the relationship between code annotations and code readability.MethodIn a survey with software developers (n=332), we present 15 pairs of Java code snippets with and without code annotations. These pairs were designed considering five categories of annotation used in real-world Java frameworks and APIs. Survey participants selected the code snippet they considered more readable for each pair and answered an open question about how annotations affect the code's readability.ResultsPreferences were scattered for all categories of annotation usage, revealing no consensus among participants. The answers were spread even when segregated by participants' programming or annotation-related experience. Nevertheless, some participants showed a consistent preference in favor or against annotations across all categories, which may indicate a personal preference. Our qualitative analysis of the open-ended questions revealed that participants often praise annotation impacts on design, maintainability, and productivity but expressed contrasting views on understandability and code clarity.ConclusionsSoftware developers and API designers can consider our results when deciding whether to use annotations, equipped with the insight that developers express contrasting views of the annotations' impact on code readability.

AB Radicals and other open-shell molecules play a central role in chemical transformations and redox chemistry. While radicals are often highly reactive, stable radical systems are desirable for a range of potential applications, ranging from materials chemistry and catalysis to spintronics and quantum information. Here we investigate the ultrafast properties of a stable radical system with temperature-dependent spin-tunable properties. This radical complex, Cu-(II) hexaethyl tripyrrin-1,14-dione, accommodates unpaired electrons localized on both the copper metal center and the tripyrrolic ligand. The unusual combination of two unpaired electrons and high stability in this radical molecule enable switchable temperature-dependent spin coupling. Two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy measurements of Cu-(II) hexaethyl tripyrrin-1,14-dione were collected at room temperature and at 77 K. At room temperature, the molecules are present as monomers and have short picosecond lifetimes. At 77 K, the molecules are present in a dimer form mediated by ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic coupling. This reversible spin-driven dimerization changes the optical properties of the system, generating long-lived excitonic states.

AB Regret Matching(+) (RM+) and its variants are important algorithms for solving large-scale games [35]. However, a theoretical understanding of their success in practice is still a mystery. Moreover, recent advances [34] on fast convergence in games are limited to no-regret algorithms such as online mirror descent, which satisfy stability. In this paper, we first give counterexamples showing that RM+ and its predictive version [12] can be unstable, which might cause other players to suffer large regret. We then provide two fixes: restarting and chopping off the positive orthant that RM+ operates in. Combined with RM+ with predictions, we show that restarting is sufficient to get O(T(1/)4) individual regret and that chopping off achieves O(1) social regret in normal-form games. We also apply our stabilizing techniques to clairvoyant updates in the uncoupled learning setting for RM+, introduced Extragradient RM+, and prove desirable results akin to recent works for Clairvoyant online mirror descent [31, 14]. Our experiments show the advantages of our algorithms over vanilla RM+-based algorithms in matrix and extensive-form games.

AB Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is applied in 5G and 6G to improve communication performance by reconfiguring signal propagation environments while maintaining low computational complexity and high energy efficiency. This paper proposes a novel methodology of joint active and passive beamforming optimization for wireless communications with the aid of multiple IRSs. In the considered system, the IRSs are deployed to assist the communication link from a multi-antenna access point (AP) to single-antenna users. We maximize the received signal to noise ratio (SNR) and sum rate of the multi-IRS-assisted communication system for single user and multiple users respectively, by solving a joint optimization problem of the active beamforming at the AP and the reflection beamforming at the IRSs. Specifically, we develop a mechanism of joint beamforming optimization for multi-IRS-assisted communications based on covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES), namely the BO-CMA algorithm, to jointly consider both the AP active beamforming and IRS reflection beamforming in the dynamic signal propagation environment. Furthermore, simulation results are provided to show that the BO-CMA algorithm is capable of significantly outperforming the benchmark schemes. Consequently, the solution based on the BO-CMA algorithm can dynamically rebuild the signal propagation environment, and improve the received SNR and the sum rate respectively for multi-IRS-assisted one user and multiple users communications.

AB BackgroundGut microbes are important to the health and fitness of many animals. Many factors have been shown to affect gut microbial communities including diet, lifestyle, and age. Most animals have very complex physiologies, lifestyles, and microbiomes, making it virtually impossible to disentangle what factors have the largest impact on microbiota composition. Honeybees are an excellent model to study host-microbe interactions due to their relatively simple gut microbiota, experimental tractability, and eusociality. Worker honey bees have distinct gut microbiota from their queen mothers despite being close genetic relatives and living in the same environment. Queens and workers differ in numerous ways including development, physiology, pheromone production, diet, and behavior. In the prolonged absence of a queen or Queen Mandibular Pheromones (QMP), some but not all workers will develop ovaries and become "queen-like". Using this inducible developmental change, we aimed to determine if diet and/or reproductive development impacts the gut microbiota of honey bee workers.ResultsMicrobiota-depleted newly emerged workers were inoculated with a mixture of queen and worker gut homogenates and reared under four conditions varying in diet and pheromone exposure. Three weeks post-emergence, workers were evaluated for ovary development and their gut microbiota communities were characterized. The proportion of workers with developed ovaries was increased in the absence of QMP but also when fed a queen diet (royal jelly). Overall, we found that diet, rather than reproductive development or pheromone exposure, led to more "queen-like" microbiota in workers. However, we revealed that diet alone cannot explain the microbiota composition of workers.ConclusionThe hypothesis that reproductive development explains microbiota differences between queens and workers was rejected. We found evidence that diet is one of the main drivers of differences between the gut microbial community compositions of queens and workers but cannot fully explain the distinct microbiota of queens. Thus, we predict that behavioral and other physiological differences dictate microbiota composition in workers and queens. Our findings not only contribute to our understanding of the factors affecting the honey bee microbiota, which is important for bee health, but also illustrate the versatility and benefits of utilizing honeybees as a model system to study host-microbe interactions.

TI Dust in high-redshift galaxies: reconciling UV attenuation and IR
   emission

ID ANALYTIC SOLUTIONS; TEUKOLSKY EQUATION
AB Dust is a key component of galaxies, but its properties during the earliest eras of structure formation remain elusive. Here we present a simple semi-analytic model of the dust distribution in galaxies at z greater than or similar to 5. We calibrate the free parameters of this model to estimates of the UV attenuation (using the IRX-beta relation between infrared emission and the UV spectral slope) and to ALMA measurements of dust emission. We find that the observed dust emission requires that most of the dust expected in these galaxies is retained (assuming a similar yield to lower-redshift sources), but if the dust is spherically distributed, the modest attenuation requires that it be significantly more extended than the stars. Interestingly, the retention fraction is larger for less massive galaxies in our model. However, the required radius is a significant fraction of the host's virial radius and is larger than the estimated extent of dust emission from stacked high-z galaxies. These can be reconciled if the dust is distributed anisotropically, with typical covering fractions of similar to 0.2-0.7 in bright galaxies and less than or similar to 0.1 in fainter ones.

AB Polymer electrolyte-based electric double-layer supercapacitors (EDLCs) have been increasingly studied for flexible, wearable, and multifunctional energy storage applications. Although the phenomenon that electrode materials present significantly lower EDL capacitances in polymer electrolytes than in liquid electrolytes has been widely observed, it has not been well studied and explained. Here we present the molecular dynamics simulation of a representative polymer electrolyte-based EDLC to reveal the atomic structure of such a polymer electrolyte-electrode interface for the first time. The polymer electrolyte composed of polyethylene oxide and lithium perchlorate is simulated between graphene electrodes and compared with an aqueous electrolyte-based system with the same lithium salt. We find that the polymer-based system shows unique EDL structures in the inner and outer Helmholtz layers that are not seen in the aqueous one. Statistical analyses along with ab initio calculations show that the disparities mainly come from the different interaction strengths between ions, poly-mer or water molecules, and graphene electrodes. Despite these disparities, the intrinsic interfacial capacitances calculated from various simulated charge states of different EDLCs show very close values. Combined with experimental measurements, we conclude that the reduced capacitances with polymer electrolytes reported in the literature come from the poor interface between electrode and electrolyte, which can be significantly improved through proper thermal treatments.

AB Epitaxial W-Mo multilayers are employed as a model system to demonstrate how resistivity measurements parallel to metal-metal interfaces can be used to quantify the specific interface resistance without sub-10-nm patterning that would be required for direct transport measurements across the interface. 50-nm-thick epitaxial multilayer stacks containing 2-60 individual W(001) and Mo(001) layers are deposited on MgO(001) substrates and their resistivity rho measured as a function of superlattice period Lambda at 293 and 77 K. The measured room temperature rho increases from 7.10 to 8.62 mu Omega cm with decreasing Lambda = 50-1.7 nm, which is attributed to the increasing electron-interface scattering. The semiclassical Fuchs-Sondheimer model for surface scattering dramatically overestimates the resistivity, which is attributed to coherent electron transmission across multiple interfaces. A new Boltzmann transport model treats each interface as a boundary condition where electrons either scatter diffusely or traverse without momentum loss with a probability T for the first encountered interface and with 100% transmission at subsequent interfaces until they are relaxed by a bulk scattering event. This model has a single unknown parameter T, which becomes the fitting parameter for experimental data analysis, yielding a temperature-independent T = 0.8 +/- 0.1 and a corresponding contact resistance at the W(001)-Mo(001) interface of 2.6 x 10(-16) Omega m(2).

TI Voxelated bioprinting of modular double-network bio-ink droplets
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS

DT Article
ID CELLS; ENCAPSULATION; HYDROGELS; PEG
AB Analogous of pixels to two-dimensional pictures, voxels-in the form of either small cubes or spheres-are the basic building blocks of three-dimensional objects. However, precise manipulation of viscoelastic bio-ink voxels in three-dimensional space represents a grand challenge in both soft matter science and biomanufacturing. Here, we present a voxelated bioprinting technology that enables the digital assembly of interpenetrating double-network hydrogel droplets made of polyacrylamide/alginate-based or hyaluronic acid/alginate-based polymers. The hydrogels are crosslinked via additive-free and biofriendly click reaction between a pair of stoichiometrically matched polymers carrying norbornene and tetrazine groups, respectively. We develop theoretical frameworks to describe the crosslinking kinetics and stiffness of the hydrogels, and construct a diagram-of-state to delineate their mechanical properties. Multi-channel print nozzles are developed to allow on-demand mixing of highly viscoelastic bio-inks without significantly impairing cell viability. Further, we showcase the distinctive capability of voxelated bioprinting by creating highly complex three-dimensional structures such as a hollow sphere composed of interconnected yet distinguishable hydrogel particles. Finally, we validate the cytocompatibility and in vivo stability of the printed double-network scaffolds through cell encapsulation and animal transplantation.
   Voxel bioprinting uses bio-ink droplets as building blocks to create functional tissue mimics, but manipulating small bio-ink droplets in 3D space can be challenging. Here, the authors report a bioprinting technology allowing prescribed assembly of bio-ink voxels to form robust 3D constructs.

AB Gender differences in creative thinking competency, career interest, and situated expectancy-value beliefs in STEM, have been widely studied separately. This study brings these lines of research together by examining gender differences in the association between adolescents' perceived opportunities for creative thinking, creative thinking competency belief, and career interest in STEM, as well as the mediating role of STEM situated expectancy-value beliefs. Results from structural equation models (SEMs) with 737 middle/high school students attending the Prefreshman Engineering Program (PREP) in the Southwestern United States showed that perceived opportunities for creative thinking in STEM education settings were positively associated with creative thinking competency belief and career interest in STEM, after controlling for pre-measures and background characteristics. Multigroup SEM analyses indicated that there were no significant gender differences in the relationship between perceived opportunities for creative thinking in STEM and the two examined STEM outcomes in our student sample. A set of mediation analyses demonstrated that STEM expectancy belief, intrinsic value, and utility value serve as key mediators linking perceived opportunities for creative thinking in STEM to student STEM outcomes. However, only the indirect effect of perceived opportunities for creative thinking in STEM on creative thinking competency belief through STEM expectancy belief was significant for both girls and boys. The mediating effects of STEM intrinsic value on both outcomes and the mediating effect of STEM utility value on STEM career interest were only significant for boys and not girls. Taken together, the findings of this study advance our understanding of the benefits of opportunities for creative thinking in STEM for middle/high school students and the underlying mechanisms by which creative-supporting contexts have influence on students STEM outcomes differently for girls and boys.

TI Robust Training under Label Noise by Over-parameterization

AB Recently, over-parameterized deep networks, with increasingly more network parameters than training samples, have dominated the performances of modern machine learning. However, when the training data is corrupted, it has been well-known that over-parameterized networks tend to overfit and do not generalize. In this work, we propose a principled approach for robust training of over-parameterized deep networks in classification tasks where a proportion of training labels are corrupted. The main idea is yet very simple: label noise is sparse and incoherent with the network learned from clean data, so we model the noise and learn to separate it from the data. Specifically, we model the label noise via another sparse over-parameterization term, and exploit implicit algorithmic regularizations to recover and separate the underlying corruptions. Remarkably, when trained using such a simple method in practice, we demonstrate state-of-the-art test accuracy against label noise on a variety of real datasets. Furthermore, our experimental results are corroborated by theory on simplified linear models, showing that exact separation between sparse noise and low-rank data can be achieved under incoherent conditions. The work opens many interesting directions for improving over-parameterized models by using sparse over-parameterization and implicit regularization.

TI On the Fundamental Limits of Coded Caching With Correlated Files of
   Combinatorial Overlaps
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY

DT Article
DE Coded caching; correlated files; interference alignment
ID NETWORKS; DELIVERY; TRADEOFF
AB This paper studies the fundamental limits of the shared-link coded caching problem with correlated files, where a server with a library of N files communicates with K users who can locally cache M files. Given an integer r is an element of [N], correlation is modelled as follows: each r-subset of files contains a unique common block. The tradeoff between the cache size and the average transmitted load over the uniform demand distribution is studied. First, a converse bound under the constraint of uncoded cache placement (i.e., each user directly stores a subset of the library bits) is derived. Then, a caching scheme for the case where every user demands a distinct file (possible for N >= K) is shown to be optimal under the constraint of uncoded cache placement. This caching scheme is further proved to be decodable and optimal under the constraint of uncoded cache placement when (i) KrM <= 2N or KrM >= (K - 1)N or r is an element of {1, 2, N - 1, N}, and (ii) when the number of distinct demanded files is no larger than four. Finally, a new delivery scheme based on interference alignment which jointly serves the users' demands is shown to be order optimal to within a factor of 2 under the constraint of uncoded cache placement. As an extension, the above exact and order optimal results can be extended to the worst-case load. As by-products, an extension of the proposed scheme for M = N/K is shown to reduce the load of state-of-the-art schemes for the coded caching problem where the users can request multiple files; the proposed scheme for distinct demands can be extended to the coded distributed computing problem with a central server, which achieves the optimal transmission load over the binary field.

AB Detecting the impacts of natural and anthropogenic disturbances that cause declines in organisms or changes in community composition has long been a focus of ecology. However, a tradeoff often exists between the spatial extent over which relevant data can be collected, and the resolution of those data. Recent advances in underwater photogrammetry, as well as computer vision and machine learning tools that employ artificial intelligence (AI), offer potential solutions with which to resolve this tradeoff. Here, we coupled a rigorous photogrammetric survey method with novel AI-assisted image segmentation software in order to quantify the impact of a coral bleaching event on a tropical reef, both at an ecologically meaningful spatial scale and with high spatial resolution. In addition to outlining our workflow, we highlight three key results: (1) dramatic changes in the three-dimensional surface areas of live and dead coral, as well as the ratio of live to dead colonies before and after bleaching; (2) a size-dependent pattern of mortality in bleached corals, where the largest corals were disproportionately affected, and (3) a significantly greater decline in the surface area of live coral, as revealed by our approximation of the 3D shape compared to the more standard planar area (2D) approach. The technique of photogrammetry allows us to turn 2D images into approximate 3D models in a flexible and efficient way. Increasing the resolution, accuracy, spatial extent, and efficiency with which we can quantify effects of disturbances will improve our ability to understand the ecological consequences that cascade from small to large scales, as well as allow more informed decisions to be made regarding the mitigation of undesired impacts.

AB Crosslinked polyamidoximes (PAOs) were synthesized using terephthaloyl chloride (TPC) as a crosslinking agent, which interacted with the pendant amidoxime groups on the polymer chains. The incorporation of a stiff 1,2,4-oxadiazole bridging unit was achieved by reacting TPC with PAOs in tetrahydrofuran (THF) under reflux. The linkage was verified using FTIR spectroscopy to identify the characteristic functional groups in the crosslinked polyamidoximes. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns indicated improved chain alignment due to crosslinking. Additionally, the thermal stability of crosslinked PAOs increased significantly to a range of 515-593 degrees C, compared to 426-489 degrees C for non-crosslinked PAOs. These crosslinked PAOs were tested for their effectiveness in removing metal ions through a batch process. Optimal conditions resulted in maximum adsorption efficiencies of 86% for Cd (II) and 88% for Pb (II) at pH 6, with a contact time of 3 h, a feed concentration of 40 mg/L, and 0.1 g of adsorbent. The adsorption mechanism conformed more closely to the Langmuir isotherm than the Freundlich model. In competitive adsorption, the order of metal uptake was Fe (II) > Pb (II) > Cd (II) > Cu (II). Consequently, this class of crosslinked polyamidoximes shows potential for use in water treatment applications for removing heavy metal ions.

AB In biological systems, electrons, energy, and information "flow" through the redox modality, and we ask, does biology have redox capacitor capabilities for storing electrons? We describe emerging evidence indicating that biological phenolic/catecholic materials possess such redox capacitor properties. We further describe results that show biomimetic catecholic materials are reversibly redox-active with redox potentials in the midphysiological range and can repeatedly accept electrons (from various reductants), store electrons, and donate electrons (to various oxidants). Importantly, catechol-containing films that are assembled onto electrode surfaces can enhance the flow of electrons, energy, and information. Further, catechol-containing films can serve as redox-based interactive materials capable of actuating biological responses by turning on gene expression from redox-responsive genetic circuits. Looking forward, we envision that the emerging capabilities for measuring dynamic redox processes and reversible redox states will provide new insights into redox biology and will also catalyze new technological opportunities for information processing and energy harvesting.

AB The Kitaev model on a honeycomb lattice may provide a robust topological quantum memory platform, but finding a material that realizes the unique spin-liquid phase remains a considerable challenge. We demonstrate that an effective Kitaev Hamiltonian can arise from a half-filled Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian where each site can experience a magnetic field in a different direction. As such, we provide a method for realizing the Kitaev spin liquid on a single hexagonal plaquette made up of 12 quantum dots. Despite the small system size, there are clear signatures of the Kitaev spin-liquid ground state, and there is a range of parameters where these signatures are predicted, allowing a potential platform where Kitaev spin-liquid physics can be explored experimentally in quantum dot plaquettes.

AB Exploring new strategies to design non-precious and efficient electrocatalysts can provide a solution for sluggish electrocatalytic kinetics and sustainable hydrogen energy. Transition metal selenides are potential contenders for bifunctional electrocatalysis owing to their unique layered structure, low band gap, and high intrinsic activities. However, insufficient access to active sites, lethargic water dissociation, and structural degradation of active materials during electrochemical reactions limit their activities, especially in alkaline media. In this article, we report a useful strategy to assemble vanadium diselenide (VSe2) into a 3D MXene/rGO-based sponge-like architecture (VSe2@G/MXe) using hydrothermal and freeze-drying approaches. The 3D hierarchical meso/macro-pore rich sponge-like morphology not only prevents aggregation of VSe2 nanosheets but also offers a kinetics-favorable framework and high robustness to the electrocatalyst. Synergistic coupling of VSe2 and a MXene/rGO matrix yields a heterostructure with a large specific surface area, high conductivity, and multi-dimensional anisotropic pore channels for uninterrupted mass transport and gas diffusion. Consequently, VSe2@G/MXe presented superior electrochemical activity for both the HER and OER compared to its counterparts (VSe2 and VSe2@G), in alkaline media. The overpotentials required to reach a cathodic and anodic current density of 10 mA cm-2 were 153 mV (Tafel slope = 84 mV dec-1) and 241 mV (Tafel slope = 87 mV dec-1), respectively. The Rct values at the open circuit voltage were as low as 9.1 Omega and 1.41 Omega for the HER and OER activity, respectively. Importantly, VSe2@G/MXe withstands a steady current output for a long 24 h operating time. Hence, this work presents a rational design for 3D microstructures with optimum characteristics for efficient bifunctional alkaline water-splitting.

AB The TAM family of receptor tyrosine kinases is implicated in multiple distinct oncogenic signaling pathways. However, to date, there are no FDA-approved small molecule inhibitors for the TAM kinases. Inhibitor design and screening rely on tools to study the kinase activity. Our goal was to address this gap by designing a set of synthetic peptide substrates for each of the TAM family members: Tyro3, Axl, and Mer. We used an in vitro phosphoproteomics workflow to determine the substrate profile of each TAM kinase and input the identified substrates into our data processing pipeline, KINATEST-ID, producing a position-specific scoring matrix for each target kinase and generating a list of candidate synthetic peptide substrates. We synthesized and characterized a set of those substrate candidates, systematically measuring their initial phosphorylation rate with each TAM kinase by LC-MS. We also used the multimer modeling function of AlphaFold2 (AF2) to predict peptide-kinase interactions at the active site for each of the novel candidate peptide sequences against each of the TAM family kinases and observed that, remarkably, every sequence for which it predicted a putative catalytically competent interaction was also demonstrated biochemically to be a substrate for one or more of the TAM kinases. This work shows that kinase substrate design can be achieved using a combination of preference motifs and structural modeling, and it provides the first demonstration of peptide-protein interaction modeling with AF2 for predicting the likelihood of constructive catalytic interactions.

AB The multi-armed bandit (MAB) models have always received lots of attention from multiple research communities due to their broad application domains. The optimal selection problem with unknown rewards in advance, such as ad recommendation in social networks, spectrum access in the cognitive radio field, etc., can be efficiently solved by using MAB models. In an MAB model, given N arms whose rewards are unknown in advance, the player selects exactly one arm in each round, and his goal is to maximize the cumulative rewards over a fixed horizon. Further, a more general model called combinatorial MAB (i.e., CMAB), where K arms can be played simultaneously in each round, is put forward. However, the existing CMAB models neglect the strategic behaviors of the N arms, which indicates that one arm might report false information to increase its own profits. In fact, in many applications such as user selection in crowdsensing, the arms are not the feelingless machines but the rational individuals. To this end, we combine the upper confidence bound (UCB) with auction theory to develop a new algorithm called auction-based UCB (AUCB). We divide the auction-based CMAB problem into two sub-problems: winning arm selection and payment computation problems. For AUCB, we derive an upper bound on regret and prove the truthfulness in one round, individual rationality, and computational efficiency. In addition, we consider an extended situation that some arms may be unavailable in some rounds and the arms will bid inconsistently in different rounds. We devise another algorithm called eAUCB to solve this problem. Extensive simulations are conducted to show the significant performance of the proposed algorithms.

AB Interactions of low-energy electrons with the DNA and RNA nucleobases are known to form metastable states, known as electronic resonances. In this work, we study electron attachment to solvated uracil, an RNA nucleobase, using the orbital stabilization method at the Equation of Motion-Coupled Cluster for Electron Affinities with Singles and Doubles (EOM-EA-CCSD) level of theory with the Effective Fragment Potential (EFP) solvation method. We benchmarked the approach using multireference methods, as well as by comparing EFP and full quantum calculations. The impact of solvation on the first one particle (1p) shape resonance, formed by electron attachment to the pi* LUMO orbital, as well as the first two particle one hole (2p1h) resonance, formed by electron attachment to neutral uracil's pi-pi* excited state, was investigated. We used molecular dynamics simulations for solvent configurations and applied charge stabilization technique-based biased sampling to procure configurations adequate to cover the entire range of the electron attachment energy distribution. The electron attachment energy in solution is found to be distributed over a wide range of energies, between 4.6 eV to 6.8 eV for the 2p1h resonance, and between -0.1 eV to 2 eV for the 1p resonance. The solvent effects were similar for the two resonances, indicating that the exact electron density of the state is not as important as the solvent configurations. Multireference calculations extended the findings showing that solvation effects are similar for the lowest four resonances, further indicating that the specific solute electron density is not as important, but rather the water configurations play the most important role in solvation effects. Finally, by comparing bulk solvation to clusters of uracil with a few water molecules around it, we find that the impact of microsolvation is very different from that of bulk solvation.

AB Understanding how a macromolecule's primary sequence governs its conformational landscape is crucial for elucidating its function, yet these design principles are still emerging for macromolecules with intrinsic disorder. Herein, we introduce a high-throughput workflow that implements a practical colorimetric conformational assay, introduces a semi-automated sequencing protocol using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization and tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS/MS), and develops a generalizable sequence-structure algorithm. Using a model system of 20mer peptidomimetics containing polar glycine and hydrophobic N-butylglycine residues, we identified nine classifications of conformational disorder and isolated 122 unique sequences across varied compositions and conformations. Conformational distributions of three compositionally identical library sequences were corroborated through atomistic simulations and ion mobility spectrometry coupled with liquid chromatography. A data-driven strategy was developed using existing sequence variables and data-derived "motifs"to inform a machine-learning algorithm toward conformation prediction. This multifaceted approach enhances our understanding of sequence-conformation relationships and offers a powerful tool for accelerating the discovery of materials with conformational control.

TI Investigation of Ga interstitial and vacancy diffusion in

   master diffusion equations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS

ID TOTAL-ENERGY CALCULATIONS; WAVE; POINTS
AB The low symmetry of monoclinic beta-Ga2O3 leads to elaborate intrinsic defects, such as Ga vacancies split amongst multiple lattice sites. These defects contribute to fast, anisotropic Ga diffusion, yet their complexity makes it challenging to understand dominant diffusion mechanisms. Here, we predict the 3D diffusivity tensors for Ga interstitials (Ga-i(3+)) and vacancies (V-Ga(3-)) via first principles and direct solution of the master diffusion equations. We first explore the maximum extent of configurationally complex "N-split" Ga interstitials and vacancies. With dominant low-energy defects identified, we enumerate all possible elementary hops connecting defect configurations to each other, including interstitialcy hops. Hopping barriers are obtained from nudged elastic band simulations. Finally, the comprehensive sets of (i) defect configurations and their energies and (ii) the hopping barriers that connect them are used to construct the master diffusion equations for both Ga-i(3+) and V-Ga(3-). The solution to these equations yields the Onsager transport coefficients, i.e., the components of the 3D diffusivity tensors D-Gai and D-VGa for Ga-i(3+) and V-Ga(3-), respectively. It further reveals the active diffusion paths along all crystallographic directions. We find that both Ga-i(3+) and V-Ga(3-) diffusion are fastest along the c axis, due to three-split defects that bridge neighboring unit cells along the c axis and enable diffusing species to circumvent pathways with high-energy migration barriers. Although isolated Ga-i(3+) diffuse faster than isolated V-Ga(3-), self-diffusion of Ga is predominantly mediated by V-Ga(3-) due to the higher V-Ga(3-) defect concentration under most thermodynamic environments.

AB There is growing interest in predictive coding as a model of how the brain learns through predictions and prediction errors. Predictive coding models have traditionally focused on sensory coding and perception. Here we introduce active predictive coding (APC) as a unifying model for perception, action, and cognition. The APC model addresses important open problems in cognitive science and AI, including (1) how we learn compositional representations (e.g., part-whole hierarchies for equivariant vision) and (2) how we solve large-scale planning problems, which are hard for traditional reinforcement learning, by composing complex state dynamics and abstract actions from simpler dynamics and primitive actions. By using hypernetworks, self-supervised learning, and reinforcement learning, APC learns hierarchical world models by combining task-invariant state transition networks and task-dependent policy networks at multiple abstraction levels. We illustrate the applicability of the APC model to active visual perception and hierarchical planning. Our results represent, to our knowledge, the first proof-of-concept demonstration of a unified approach to addressing the part-whole learning problem in vision, the nested reference frames learning problem in cognition, and the integrated state-action hierarchy learning problem in reinforcement learning.

TI Deciphering the Cofilin Oligomers via Intermolecular Disulfide Bond
   Formation: A Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics Approach to Understanding
   Cofilin's Regulation on Actin Filaments
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B

AB Cofilin, a key actin-binding protein, orchestrates the dynamics of the actomyosin network through its actin-severing activity and by promoting the recycling of actin monomers. Recent experiments suggest that cofilin forms functionally distinct oligomers via thiol post-translational modifications (PTMs) that promote actin nucleation and assembly. Despite these advances, the structural conformations of cofilin oligomers that modulate actin activity remain elusive because there are combinatorial ways to oxidize thiols in cysteines to form disulfide bonds rapidly. This study employs molecular dynamics simulations to investigate human cofilin 1 as a case study for exploring cofilin dimers via disulfide bond formation. Utilizing a biasing scheme in simulations, we focus on analyzing dimer conformations conducive to disulfide bond formation. Additionally, we explore potential PTMs arising from the examined conformational ensemble. Using the free energy profiling, our simulations unveil a range of probable cofilin dimer structures not represented in current Protein Data Bank entries. These candidate dimers are characterized by their distinct population distributions and relative free energies. Of particular note is a dimer featuring an interface between cysteines 139 and 147 residues, which demonstrates stable free energy characteristics and intriguingly symmetrical geometry. In contrast, the experimentally proposed dimer structure exhibits a less stable free energy profile. We also evaluate frustration quantification based on the energy landscape theory in the protein-protein interactions at the dimer interfaces. Notably, the 39-39 dimer configuration emerges as a promising candidate for forming cofilin tetramers, as substantiated by frustration analysis. Additionally, docking simulations with actin filaments further evaluate the stability of these cofilin dimer-actin complexes. Our findings thus offer a computational framework for understanding the role of thiol PTM of cofilin proteins in regulating oligomerization, and the subsequent cofilin-mediated actin dynamics in the actomyosin network.

AB Realizing direct band gap quantum dots working within the deep-ultraviolet frequency is highly desired for electro-optical and biomedical applications while remaining challenging. In this work, we combine first-principles many-body perturbation theory and effective Hamiltonian approximation to propose the realization of arrays of deep-ultraviolet excitonic quantum dots in twisted bilayer hexagonal boron nitride. The effective quantum confinement of excitons can reach similar to 400 meV within small twisting angles, which is about four times larger than those observed in twisted semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides. Especially because of enhanced electron-hole attraction, those excitons will accumulate via the so-called exciton funnel effect to the direct band gap regime, giving the possibility to better luminescence performance and manipulating coherent arrays of deep-ultraviolet quantum dots.

AB Echinometra lucunter, the rock-boring sea urchin, is a widely distributed echinoid and a model for ecological studies of reproduction, responses to climate change, and speciation. We present a near chromosome-level genome assembly of E. lucunter, including 21 scaffolds larger than 10 Mb predicted to represent each of the chromosomes of the species. The 760.4 Mb assembly includes a scaffold N50 of 30.0 Mb and BUSCO (benchmarking universal single-copy orthologue) single copy and a duplicated score of 95.8% and 1.4%, respectively. Ab-initio gene model prediction and annotation with transcriptomic data constructed 33,989 gene models composing 50.4% of the assembly, including 37,036 transcripts. Repetitive elements make up approximately 39.6% of the assembly, and unresolved gap sequences are estimated to be 0.65%. Whole genome alignment with Echinometra sp. EZ revealed high synteny and conservation between the two species, further bolstering Echinometra as an emerging genus for comparative genomics studies. This genome assembly represents a high-quality genomic resource for future evolutionary and developmental studies of this species and more broadly of echinoderms.

AB Phenotypic covariation among suites of traits may constrain or promote diversification both within and between species, yet few studies have empirically tested this relationship. In this study, we investigate whether phenotypic covariation of craniofacial traits is associated with diversification in an adaptive radiation of pupfishes found only on San Salvador Island, Bahamas (SSI). The radiation includes generalist, durophagous, and lepidophagous species. We compared phenotypic variation and covariation (i.e., the P matrix) between (1) allopatric populations of generalist pupfish from neighboring islands and estuaries in the Caribbean, (2) SSI pupfish allopatric lake populations with only generalist pupfish, and (3) SSI lake populations containing the full radiation in sympatry. Additionally, we examine patterns observed in the P matrices of two independent lab-reared F2 hybrid crosses of the two most morphologically distinct members of the radiation to make inferences about the underlying mechanisms contributing to the variation in craniofacial traits in SSI pupfishes. We found that the P matrix of SSI allopatric generalist populations exhibited higher levels of mean trait correlation, constraints, and integration with simultaneously lower levels of flexibility compared to allopatric generalist populations on other Caribbean islands and sympatric populations of all three species on SSI. We also document that while many craniofacial traits appear to result from additive genetic effects, variation in key traits such as head depth, maxilla length, and lower jaw length may be produced via non-additive genetic mechanisms. Ultimately, this study suggests that differences in phenotypic covariation significantly contribute to producing and maintaining organismal diversity.
   This study explores the relationship between diversification and trait covariation using an endemic adaptive radiation of pupfishes. We find evidence suggesting that strong covariation between traits may constrain pupfish diversification, and that nonadditive genetic variation may be responsible for variation in important craniofacial traits in the system.image

AB Exoskeleton devices can reduce metabolic cost, increase walking speed, and augment load-carrying capacity. However, little is known about the effects of powered assistance on the sensory information required to achieve these tasks. To learn how to use an assistive device, humans must integrate novel sensory information into their internal model. This process may be disrupted by challenges to the sensory systems used for posture. We investigated the exoskeleton-induced changes to balance performance and sensory integration during quiet standing. We asked 11 unimpaired adults to perform a virtual reality-based test of sensory integration in balance (VRSIB) on two days while wearing the exoskeleton either unpowered, using proportional myoelectric control, or with regular shoes. We measured postural biomechanics, muscle activity, equilibrium scores, postural control strategy, and sensory ratios. Results showed improvement in balance performance when wearing the exoskeleton on firm ground. The opposite occurred when standing on an unstable platform with eyes closed or when the visual information was non-veridical. The balance performance was equivalent when the exoskeleton was powered versus unpowered in all conditions except when both the support surface and the visual information were altered. We argue that in stable ground conditions, the passive stiffness of the device dominates the postural task. In contrast, when the ground becomes unstable the passive stiffness negatively affects balance performance. Furthermore, when the visual input to the user is non-veridical, exoskeleton assistance can magnify erroneous muscle inputs and negatively impact the user's postural control.

ID RNA-SEQ; C-MYC; EXPRESSION; GENES; VARIABLES; STATES; ROLES
AB Data integration to align cells across batches has become a cornerstone of single-cell data analysis, critically affecting downstream results. Currently, there are no guidelines for when the biological differences between samples are separable from batch effects. Here we show that current paradigms for single-cell data integration remove biologically meaningful variation and introduce distortion. We present a statistical model and computationally scalable algorithm, CellANOVA (cell state space analysis of variance), that harnesses experimental design to explicitly recover biological signals that are erased during single-cell data integration. CellANOVA uses a 'pool-of-controls' design concept, applicable across diverse settings, to separate unwanted variation from biological variation of interest and allow the recovery of subtle biological signals. We apply CellANOVA to diverse contexts and validate the recovered biological signals by orthogonal assays. In particular, we show that CellANOVA is effective in the challenging case of single-cell and single-nucleus data integration, where it recovers subtle biological signals that can be validated and replicated by external data.
   A statistical framework quantifies single-cell batch variation and recovers meaningful biological signals.

ID PREDICTING CA2+-BINDING SITES
AB Proteins' flexibility is a feature in communicating changes in cell signaling instigated by binding with secondary messengers, such as calcium ions, associated with the coordination of muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release, and gene expression. When binding with the disordered parts of a protein, calcium ions must balance their charge states with the shape of calcium-binding proteins and their versatile pool of partners depending on the circumstances they transmit. Accurately determining the ionic charges of those ions is essential for understanding their role in such processes. However, it is unclear whether the limited experimental data available can be effectively used to train models to accurately predict the charges of calcium-binding protein variants. Here, we developed a chemistry-informed, machine-learning algorithm that implements a game theoretic approach to explain the output of a machine-learning model without the prerequisite of an excessively large database for high-performance prediction of atomic charges. We used the ab initio electronic structure data representing calcium ions and the structures of the disordered segments of calcium-binding peptides with surrounding water molecules to train several explainable models. Network theory was used to extract the topological features of atomic interactions in the structurally complex data dictated by the coordination chemistry of a calcium ion, a potent indicator of its charge state in protein. Our design created a computational tool of CaXML, which provided a framework of explainable machine learning model to annotate ionic charges of calcium ions in calcium-binding proteins in response to the chemical changes in an environment. Our framework will provide new insights into protein design for engineering functionality based on the limited size of scientific data in a genome space.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B

ID ERROR-CORRECTING CODES; MANY-BODY LOCALIZATION; CRITICAL PERCOLATION;
   THERMALIZATION; ENTANGLEMENT; TRANSITION
AB We explore a class of "open" quantum circuit models with local decoherence ("noise") and local projective measurements, each respecting a global Z2 symmetry. The model supports a spin-glass phase where the Z2 symmetry is spontaneously broken [not possible in an equilibrium one-dimensional (1D) system], a paramagnetic phase characterized by a divergent susceptibility, and an intermediate "trivial" phase. All three phases are also stable to Z2-symmetric local unitary gates, and the dynamical phase transitions between the phases are in the percolation universality class. The open circuit dynamics can be purified by explicitly introducing a bath with its own "scrambling" dynamics, which does not change any of the universal physics. Within the spin-glass phase the circuit dynamics can be interpreted as a quantum repetition code, with each stabilizer of the code measured stochastically at a finite rate, and the decoherences as effective bit-flip errors. Motivated by the geometry of the spin-glass phase, we devise a decoding algorithm for recovering an arbitrary initial qubit state in the code space, assuming knowledge of the history of the measurement outcomes, and the ability of performing local Pauli measurements and gates on the final state. For a circuit with Ld qubits running for time T, the time needed to execute the decoder scales as O(LdT) (with dimensionality d). With this decoder in hand, we find that the information of the initial encoded qubit state can be retained (and then recovered) for a time logarithmic in L for a 1D circuit, and for a time at least linear in L in two dimensions below a finite-error threshold. For both the repetition and toric codes, we compare and contrast our decoding algorithm with earlier algorithms that map the error model to the random bond Ising model.

AB Well recognized mechanical flexibility of twodimensional (2D) materials is shown to bring about unexpected behaviors to the recently discovered monolayer ferroelectrics, especially those displaying normal, off-plane polarization. A "ferro-flexo" coupling term is introduced into the energy expression, to account for the connection of ferroelectricity and bending (strain gradient) of the layer, to predict and quantify its spontaneous curvature and how it affects the phase transitions. With InP as a chemically specific representative example, the first-principles calculations indeed reveal strong coupling similar to P center dot K between the ferroelectric polarization (P) and the curvature of the layer (K equivalent to 1/r), having profound consequences for both mechanics and ferroelectricity of the material. Due to flexural relaxation, the spontaneous polarization and the transition barrier rise significantly, leading to large changes in the Curie temperature, coercive field, and domain wall width and energy, based on Monte Carlo simulations. On the other hand, the polarization switching, characteristic to ferroelectrics, does induce an overall layer bending, enabling a conversion of electrical signal to movement as an actuator; its possible work-cycles and maximum work-efficiency are briefly discussed.

AB Pygoscelis penguins interact with both terrestrial and marine environments, especially during the austral summer when they raise their chicks. Accessible ice-free ground spaces serve as locations for penguins to build colonies and successfully raise chicks while the surrounding marine environment serves as the foraging grounds for adult birds. Penguins must be able to navigate through the waters around their colonies to forage for Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), their primary prey during the austral summer. Krill, whose distributions are driven partially by the surrounding physics and partially by their behaviors, must also be plentiful in the waters near the colonies to support foraging penguins. Here, we test the hypothesis that terrestrial and oceanographic variables can describe habitat suitability for Pygoscelis penguins along the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) during the austral summer and hypothesize that oceanographic and terrestrial covariates contribute differently to each species based on their life-histories. We built habitat suitability models using logistic regressions with a variety of datasets and determined important covariates using jackknife analysis. We developed a novel method to estimate the contribution of oceanographic and terrestrial covariates using the model terms. Models performed well across all species (area under the curve [AUC] >0.85) and predicted existing habitats as highly suitable for each species. The models also predicted new habitat for each species, including potential habitat for gentoo penguins in Marguerite Bay. While jackknife analysis suggests that terrestrial elevation is the single most important variable for some species, variables such as spring sea ice extent, prey persistence, and near-shore current velocities also were major contributors to the model across the Peninsula. Oceanographic covariates contributed the most (similar to 65%) to chinstrap penguin habitat suitability, and the least (20%-40%) to Adelie habitat suitability. Different oceanographic variables made up most of this oceanographic term for different species, suggesting that the species select for different oceanographic habitats near breeding colonies. Understanding the major habitat suitability drivers for Pygoscelis penguins today will help us understand how habitat suitability will change in future climate conditions.

AB Predicting how a material's microscopic structure and dynamics determine its transport properties remains a fundamental challenge. To alleviate this task's often prohibitive computational expense, we propose a Mori-based generalized quantum master equation (GQME) to predict the frequency-resolved conductivity of small-polaron forming systems described by the dispersive Holstein model. Unlike previous GQME-based approaches to transport that scale with the system size and only give access to the DC conductivity, our method requires only one calculation and yields both the DC and AC mobilities. We further show how to easily augment our GQME with numerically accessible derivatives of the current to increase computational efficiency, collectively offering computational cost reductions of up to 90%, depending on the transport regime. Finally, we leverage our exact simulations to demonstrate the limited applicability of the celebrated and widely invoked Drude-Smith model in small-polaron forming systems. We instead introduce a cumulant-based analysis of experimentally accessible frequency data to infer the microscopic Hamiltonian parameters. This approach promises to provide valuable insights into material properties and facilitate guided design by linking macroscopic terahertz measurements to the microscopic details of small polaron-forming systems.
   Our work introduces a tool to minimize the cost of conductivity predictions in small polaron-forming materials and a means to map measured conductivities to polaron energy scales, overcoming the limitations of the phenomenological Drude-Smith model.

TI Planting for perfection: How to maximize cotton fiber quality with the

AB Context: Cotton quality is as crucial as cotton quantity. Despite considerable efforts to enhance cotton yield, there has been limited focus on maximizing fiber quality. The temperature experienced from flowering to boll opening becomes the critical factor affecting fiber quality when cotton is cultivated under optimum water and nutrient conditions. This depends on the planting date for a specific location and cultivar. Therefore, fiber quality can be improved by optimizing the planting date for a specific geographic location and cultivar. Objective: The study aims to develop a methodology for optimizing planting dates to maximize fiber quality, taking into account location-specific weather and cultivar details. Methods: A methodology is developed and demonstrated for the cotton belt in the USA. The methodology accounts for temperature, planting intervals, cotton varieties (early, mid, and late-season), and four major fiber quality indicators (fiber length, strength, micronaire, and uniformity). Based on the average of the last 15 years of weather data and different cotton cultivars, spatial maps depicting the best planting dates and associated fiber quality are analyzed for 765 cotton-growing counties in the USA. The study also explores variability in the optimum planting date and fiber quality with climate change in these counties. Results: Results indicate that planting cotton at the optimum planting date can improve all fiber quality features. Fiber length can range from medium (25-29 mm) to long (30-34.5 mm), fiber strength from strong (29-30 g/tex) to very strong (>31 g/tex), micronaire from the discount range (<= 3.4 and >= 5.0) to the base range (3.5-3.6 and 4.3-4.9), and uniformity can be high (>85). Applying the methodology with consideration of future climate projections shows a 19 % decline in micronaire- the most affected trait, followed by 8.4 % and 1.6 % decreases in length and uniformity, respectively. In contrast, fiber strength is expected to increase by 5 % in the future. Conclusions: Results indicate that optimizing the planting date with the developed methodology can enhance fiber quality. Additionally, the methodology can predict variations in fiber quality due to future climatic conditions. Significance: The developed methodology can be valuable for farmers and growers seeking to enhance fiber quality. It is standard and applicable to any location and cultivar. A similar approach can be adopted for other locations and crops, such as soybeans, rice, and wheat, to optimize their quality.

ID CAUSAL INFERENCE
AB Fairness-aware machine learning has attracted a surge of attention in many domains, such as online advertising, personalized recommendation, and social media analysis in web applications. Fairness-aware machine learning aims to eliminate biases of learning models against certain subgroups described by certain protected (sensitive) attributes such as race, gender, and age. Among many existing fairness notions, counterfactual fairness is a popular notion defined from a causal perspective. It measures the fairness of a predictor by comparing the prediction of each individual in the original world and that in the counterfactual worlds in which the value of the sensitive attribute is modified. A prerequisite for existing methods to achieve counterfactual fairness is the prior human knowledge of the causal model for the data. However, in real-world scenarios, the underlying causal model is often unknown, and acquiring such human knowledge could be very difficult. In these scenarios, it is risky to directly trust the causal models obtained from information sources with unknown reliability and even causal discovery methods, as incorrect causal models can consequently bring biases to the predictor and lead to unfair predictions. In this work, we address the problem of counterfactually fair prediction from observational data without given causal models by proposing a novel framework CLAIRE. Specifically, under certain general assumptions, CLAIRE effectively mitigates the biases from the sensitive attribute with a representation learning framework based on counterfactual data augmentation and an invariant penalty. Experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate the superiority of CLAIRE in both counterfactual fairness and prediction performance.

AB Quadrotors equipped with cable-suspended loads represent a versatile, low-cost, and energy efficient solution for aerial transportation, construction, and manipulation tasks. However, their real-world deployment is hindered by several challenges. The system is difficult to control because it is nonlinear, underactuated, involves hybrid dynamics due to slack-taut cable modes, and evolves on complex configuration spaces. Additionally, it is crucial to estimate the full state and the cable's mode transitions in real-time using on-board sensors and computation. To address these challenges, we present a novel Hybrid Perception-Aware Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (HPA-MPC) control approach for quadrotors with suspended loads. Our method considers the complete hybrid system dynamics and includes a perception-aware cost to ensure the payload remains visible in the robot's camera during navigation. Furthermore, the full state and hybrid dynamics' transitions are estimated using onboard sensors. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables stable load tracking control, even during slack-taut transitions, and operates entirely onboard. The experiments also show that the perception-aware term effectively keeps the payload in the robot's camera field of view when a human operator interacts with the load.

AB The myotendinous junction (MTJ) facilitates force transmission between muscle and tendon to produce joint movement. The complex microarchitecture and regional mechanical heterogeneity of the myotendinous junction pose major challenges in creating this interface in vitro. Engineering this junction in vitro is challenging due to substantial fabrication difficulties in creating scaffolds with intricate microarchitecture and stiffness heterogeneity to mimic the native muscle-tendon interface. To address the current challenges in creating the MTJ in vitro, digital light processing (DLP)-based 3D printing was used to fabricate poly(glycerol sebacate)acrylate (PGSA)-based muscle-tendon scaffolds with physiologically informed microstructure and mechanical properties. Local mechanical properties in various regions of the scaffold were tuned by adjusting the exposure time and light intensity used during the continuous DLP-based 3D printing process to match the mechanical properties present in distinct regions of native muscle-tendon tissue using printing parameters defined by an artificial intelligence-trained algorithm. To evaluate how the presence of zonal stiffness regions can affect the phenotype of a 3D-printed MTJ in vitro model, three 3D-printed PGSA-based scaffold conditions were investigated: (1) a scaffold with muscle-informed mechanical properties in its entirety without zonal stiffness regions, (2) a scaffold with one end possessing native muscle stiffness and the other end possessing native tendon stiffness, and (3) a scaffold with three distinct regions whose stiffness values correspond to those of muscle on one end of the scaffold, MTJ in the middle junction of the scaffold, and tendon on the other end of the scaffold. The scaffold containing regional mechanical heterogeneity most similar to the native MTJ (condition 3) was found to enhance the expression of MTJ-related markers compared to those without the presence of zonal stiffness regions. Overall, the DLP-based 3D printing platform and biomaterial system developed in this study could serve as a useful tool for mimicking the complexity of the native MTJ, which possesses inherent geometric and mechanical heterogeneity.

AB Following recent investigation in the ternary system Sr-Al-Pt led to the discovery of SrAl5Pt3 which crystallizes in the orthorhombic YNi5Si3 type (Pnma) structure. Interestingly, only two more aluminum representatives, CeAl5Pt3 and EuAl5Pt3, have been reported to adopt this structure type. Therefore, we decided to investigate the existence range of compounds adopting the YNi5Si3 type structure. Besides the already known Sr, Ce and Eu members, the series could be extended to Ca, Y and La-Nd as well as Sm-Er. All compounds were synthesized from the elements and characterized by powder X-ray diffraction. While for CaAl5Pt3 and LaAl5Pt3 also the respective M2Al16Pt9 members were observed, the other compounds could be obtained either as X-ray pure materials or with small amounts of Al3Pt2 as a side phase. The structure of ErAl5Pt3 could be refined from single crystal data, verifying that also the small rare-earth elements adopt the YNi5Si3 type structure. Selected members of the series were furthermore characterized by magnetization and susceptibility measurements. Since YAl5Pt3 could be obtained as a phase pure material and exhibits no paramagnetic behaviour it was investigated by Al-27 MAS NMR investigations. Also, XPS measurements were conducted on this compound to gain an insight into the charge distribution. Finally, quantum-chemical calculations supported the NMR measurements and gave an insight into the chemical bonding and the charge distribution.

AB Accessible and easy-to-use standardized bioinformatics workflows are necessary to advance microbiome research from observational studies to large-scale, data-driven approaches. Standardized multi-omics data enables comparative studies, data reuse, and applications of machine learning to model biological processes. To advance broad accessibility of standardized multi-omics bioinformatics workflows, the National Microbiome Data Collaborative (NMDC) has developed the Empowering the Development of Genomics Expertise (NMDC EDGE) resource, a user-friendly, open-source web application (https://nmdc-edge.org). Here, we describe the design and main functionality of the NMDC EDGE resource for processing metagenome, metatranscriptome, natural organic matter, and metaproteome data. The architecture relies on three main layers (web application, orchestration, and execution) to ensure flexibility and expansion to future workflows. The orchestration and execution layers leverage best practices in software containers and accommodate high-performance computing and cloud computing services. Further, we have adopted a robust user research process to collect feedback for continuous improvement of the resource. NMDC EDGE provides an accessible interface for researchers to process multi-omics microbiome data using production-quality workflows to facilitate improved data standardization and interoperability.

AB G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) make up the largest superfamily of human membrane proteins and represent primary targets of similar to 1/3 of currently marketed drugs. Allosteric modulators have emerged as more selective drug candidates compared with orthosteric agonists and antagonists. However, many X-ray and cryo-EM structures of GPCRs resolved so far exhibit negligible differences upon the binding of positive and negative allosteric modulators (PAMs and NAMs). The mechanism of dynamic allosteric modulation in GPCRs remains unclear. In this work, we have systematically mapped dynamic changes in free energy landscapes of GPCRs upon binding of allosteric modulators using the Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (GaMD), deep learning (DL), and free energy prOfiling Workflow (GLOW). GaMD simulations were performed for a total of 66 mu s on 44 GPCR systems in the presence and absence of the modulator. DL and free energy calculations revealed significantly reduced dynamic fluctuations and conformational space of GPCRs upon modulator binding. While the modulator-free GPCRs often sampled multiple low-energy conformational states, the NAMs and PAMs confined the inactive and active agonist-G-protein-bound GPCRs, respectively, to mostly only one specific conformation for signaling. Such cooperative effects were significantly reduced for binding of the selective modulators to "non-cognate" receptor subtypes. Therefore, GPCR allostery exhibits a dynamic "conformational selection" mechanism. In the absence of available modulator-bound structures as for most current GPCRs, it is critical to use a structural ensemble of representative GPCR conformations rather than a single structure for compound docking ("ensemble docking"), which will potentially improve structure-based design of novel allosteric drugs of GPCRs.

AB Science communication (scicomm) shapes our world by helping people use science to make societal and personal decisions. Supporting and doing ethical scicomm requires valuing diverse perspectives and the people who do scicomm. Unfortunately, institutional hurdles ingrained in academia impede and undermine ethical scicomm. The injustices impeding scicomm stem from the prestige paradigm of academia (articulated in the present article), which reinforces hierarchical relationships in an exclusionary and exploitative system. To move academia forward, we name and review these injustices through the lens of five realms of scicomm (scientific communication, teaching scicomm, academics engaging in scicomm, scicomm research, and scicomm careers beyond academia). We then provide a novel framework, helping readers identify axes of influence and how they can leverage their intersectional, academic capital to take concrete action to remove the hurdles impeding ethical scicomm in academia.

AB Structural supercapacitors that simultaneously bear mechanical loads and store electrical energy have exciting potential for enhancing the efficiency of various mobile systems. However, a significant hurdle in developing practical structural supercapacitors is the inherent trade-off between their mechanical properties and electrochemical capabilities, particularly within their electrolytes. This study demonstrates a tough polymer electrolyte with enhanced multifunctionality made through the controlled hydration of a solid polymer electrolyte with poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and lithium salts. Characterization via differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirms the consistent amorphous solid solution phase in varying salt concentrations, whether dried or hydrated. Electrochemical tests and tensile tests are performed to evaluate the ionic conductivity and mechanical properties of these electrolytes. The results indicate that the strategic incorporation of water in the polymer electrolyte significantly enhances the ionic conductivity while preserving its mechanical properties. A specific composition demonstrated a remarkable increase in ionic conductivity (3.11 mu S cm-1) coupled with superior toughness (15.4 MJ m-3), significantly surpassing the base polymer. These findings open new horizons for integrating electrochemical functionality into structural polymers without compromising their mechanical properties. Additionally, the paper reports the successful fabrication and testing of structural supercapacitor prototypes combining carbon fibers with fabricated electrolytes, showcasing their potential for diverse applications.
   This study showcases a tough polymer electrolyte made from poly(lactic acid) and lithium salts, with enhanced multifunctionality for structural energy storage applications through controlled hydration. It retains an amorphous solid solution across varying salt concentrations and strategically incorporates water to significantly boost ionic conductivity while preserving mechanical properties.

ID HALIDE PEROVSKITES; EFFICIENCY
AB Among promising applications of metal-halide perovskite, the most research progress is made for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Data from myriads of research work enables leveraging machine learning (ML) to significantly expedite material and device optimization as well as potentially design novel configurations. This paper represents one of the first efforts in providing open-source ML tools developed utilizing the Perovskite Database Project (PDP), the most comprehensive open-source PSC database to date with over 43 000 entries from published literature. Three ML model architectures with short-circuit current density (Jsc) as a target are trained exploiting the PDP. Using the XGBoost architecture, a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 3.58 mAcm2$\frac{mA}{cm<^>2}$, R2 of 0.35 and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 9.49% are achieved. This performance is comparable to results reported in literature, and through further investigation can likely be improved. To overcome challenges with manual database creation, an open-source data cleaning pipeline is created for PDP data. Through the creation of these tools, which have been published on GitHub, this research aims to make ML available to aid the design for PSC while showing the already promising performance achieved. The tools can be adapted for other applications, such as perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs), if a sufficient database is available.

TI Interferometric geometric phases of PT-symmetric quantum mechanics
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
LA English
DT Article
ID STATES; PHYSICS
AB We present a generalization of the geometric phase to pure and thermal states in PT -symmetric quantum mechanics (PTQM) based on the approach of the interferometric geometric phase (IGP). The formalism first introduces the parallel -transport conditions of quantum states and reveals two geometric phases, 0 1 and 0 2 , for pure states in PTQM according to the states under parallel -transport. Due to the non -Hermitian Hamiltonian in PTQM, 0 1 is complex and 0 2 is its real part. The imaginary part of 0 1 plays an important role when we generalize the IGP to thermal states in PTQM. The generalized IGP modifies the thermal distribution of a thermal state, thereby introducing effective temperatures. At certain critical points, the generalized IGP may exhibit discrete jumps at finite temperatures, signaling a geometric phase transition. We illustrate this phenomenon in PTQM through two examples and compare their differences.

TI Penetration of Cell Surface Glycocalyx by Enveloped Viruses Is Aided by
   Weak Multivalent Adhesive Interaction
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B

DT Article

AB Viral infection usually begins with adhesion between the viral particle and viral receptors displayed on the cell membrane. The exterior surface of the cell membrane is typically coated with a brush-like layer of molecules, the glycocalyx, that the viruses need to penetrate. Although there is extensive literature on the biomechanics of virus-cell adhesion, much of it is based on continuum-level models that do not address the question of how virus/cell-membrane adhesion occurs through the glycocalyx. In this work, we present a simulation study of the penetration mechanism. Using a coarse-grained molecular model, we study the force-driven and diffusive penetration of a brush-like glycocalyx by viral particles. For force-driven penetration, we find that viral particles smaller than the spacing of molecules in the brush reach the membrane surface readily. For a given maximum force, viral particles larger than the minimum spacing of brush molecules arrest at some distance from the membrane, governed by the balance of elastic and applied forces. For the diffusive case, we find that weak but multivalent attraction between the glycocalyx molecules and the virus effectively leads to its engulfment by the glycocalyx. Our finding provides potential guidance for developing glycocalyx-targeting drugs and therapies by understanding how virus-cell adhesion works.

TI Flexibility in PAM recognition expands DNA targeting in xCas9

AB xCas9 is an evolved variant of the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing system, engineered to improve specificity and reduce undesired off-target effects. How xCas9 expands the DNA targeting capability of Cas9 by recognising a series of alternative protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequences while ignoring others is unknown. Here, we elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying xCas9's expanded PAM recognition and provide critical insights for expanding DNA targeting. We demonstrate that while wild-type Cas9 enforces stringent guanine selection through the rigidity of its interacting arginine dyad, xCas9 introduces flexibility in R1335, enabling selective recognition of specific PAM sequences. This increased flexibility confers a pronounced entropic preference, which also improves recognition of the canonical TGG PAM. Furthermore, xCas9 enhances DNA binding to alternative PAM sequences during the early evolution cycles, while favouring binding to the canonical PAM in the final evolution cycle. This dual functionality highlights how xCas9 broadens PAM recognition and underscores the importance of fine-tuning the flexibility of the PAM-interacting cleft as a key strategy for expanding the DNA targeting potential of CRISPR-Cas systems. These findings deepen our understanding of DNA recognition in xCas9 and may apply to other CRISPR-Cas systems with similar PAM recognition requirements.

AB Proteinuria, the presence of high molecular weight proteins in the urine, is a primary indicator of chronic kidney disease. Proteinuria results from increased molecular permeability of the glomerular filtration barrier combined with saturation or defects in tubular protein reabsorption. Any solute that passes into the glomerular filtrate traverses the glomerular endothelium, the glomerular basement membrane, and the podocyte slit diaphragm. Damage to any layer of the filter has reciprocal effects on other layers to increase glomerular permeability. The GBM is thought to act as a compressible ultrafilter that has increased molecular selectivity with increased pressure due to compression that reduced the porosity of the GBM with increased pressure. In multiple forms of chronic kidney disease, crosslinking enzymes are upregulated and may act to increase GBM stiffness. Here we show that enzymatically crosslinking porcine GBM with transglutaminase increases the stiffness of the GBM and mitigates pressure -dependent reductions in molecular sieving coefficient. This was modeled mathematically using a modified membrane transport model accounting for GBM compression. Changes in the mechanical properties of the GBM may contribute to proteinuria through pressure -dependent effects on GBM porosity.

AB In this paper, we develop a formal assured simplification method to accelerate the safety verification process of a neural network model that approximates a nonlinear dynamical system. Firstly, an assured compression error is proposed to describe the maximum output difference introduced by neural network compression. A reachability-based computational process is then developed to estimate the assured compression error. The assured compression error is used to accelerate the reachability analysis and safety verification of neural network dynamical system models, which can significantly reduce the computational time for safety verification. Finally, the proposed approach is applied to a case study of a magnetic levitation system to demonstrate its correctness and effectiveness.

We then selected the composition that forms thin plates with well-defined shapes, Er(NO3)Phen(2), and explored the effects of various conditions on crystal formation and growth, including temperature regime, light illumination, and substrates where the crystals are formed and grown. The composition and local environment strongly affect the size and shape of microcrystals and substrate coverage. The use of gold substrates significantly enhances the crystal growing process. Elevated temperatures negatively affect the crystal growth.

AB Adversarial contrastive learning (ACL) does not require expensive data annotations but outputs a robust representation that withstands adversarial attacks and also generalizes to a wide range of downstream tasks. However, ACL needs tremendous running time to generate the adversarial variants of all training data, which limits its scalability to large datasets. To speed up ACL, this paper proposes a robustness-aware coreset selection (RCS) method. RCS does not require label information and searches for an informative subset that minimizes a representational divergence, which is the distance of the representation between natural data and their virtual adversarial variants. The vanilla solution of RCS via traversing all possible subsets is computationally prohibitive. Therefore, we theoretically transform RCS into a surrogate problem of submodular maximization, of which the greedy search is an efficient solution with an optimality guarantee for the original problem. Empirically, our comprehensive results corroborate that RCS can speed up ACL by a large margin without significantly hurting the robustness transferability. Notably, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to conduct ACL efficiently on the large-scale ImageNet-1K dataset to obtain an effective robust representation via RCS.

TI Supernova shocks cannot explain the inflated state of hypervelocity

AB Recent observations have found a growing number of hypervelocity stars with speeds of approximate to 1500 - 2500 km s(-1) that could have only been produced through thermonuclear supernovae in white dwarf binaries. Most of the observed hypervelocity runaways in this class display a surprising inflated structure: their current radii are roughly an order of magnitude greater than they would have been as white dwarfs filling their Roche lobe. While many simulations exist studying the dynamical phase leading to supernova detonation in these systems, no detailed calculations of the long-term structure of the runaways have yet been performed. We used an existing AREPO hydrodynamical simulation of a supernova in a white dwarf binary as a starting point for the evolution of these stars with the one-dimensional stellar evolution code MESA. We show that the supernova shock is not energetic enough to inflate the white dwarf over timescales longer than a few thousand years, significantly shorter than the 10(5 - 6) year lifetimes inferred for observed hypervelocity runaways. Although they experience a shock from a supernova less than approximate to 0.02 R-circle dot away, our models do not experience significant interior heating, and all contract back to radii of around 0.01 R-circle dot within about 10(4) years. Explaining the observed inflated states requires either an additional source of significant heating or some other physics that is not yet accounted for in the subsequent evolution.

AB Opportunistic pathogens are environmental microbes that are generally harmless and only occasionally cause disease. Unlike obligate pathogens, the growth and survival of opportunistic pathogens do not rely on host infection or transmission. Their versatile lifestyles make it challenging to decipher how and why virulence has evolved in opportunistic pathogens. The coincidental evolution hypothesis postulates that virulence results from exaptation or pleiotropy, i.e. traits evolved for adaptation to living in one environment that have a different function in another. In particular, adaptation to avoid or survive protist predation has been suggested to contribute to the evolution of bacterial virulence (the training ground hypothesis). Here, we used experimental evolution to determine how the selective pressure imposed by a protist predator impacts the virulence and fitness of a ubiquitous environmental opportunistic bacterial pathogen that has acquired multidrug resistance: Serratia marcescens. To this aim, we evolved S. marcescens in the presence or absence of generalist protist predator, Tetrahymena thermophila. After 60 d of evolution, we evaluated genotypic and phenotypic changes by comparing evolved S. marcescens with the ancestral strain. Whole-genome shotgun sequencing of the entire evolved populations and individual isolates revealed numerous cases of parallel evolution, many more than statistically expected by chance, in genes associated with virulence. Our phenotypic assays suggested that evolution in the presence of a predator maintained virulence, whereas evolution in the absence of a predator resulted in attenuated virulence. We also found a significant correlation between virulence, biofilm formation, growth, and grazing resistance. Overall, our results provide evidence that bacterial virulence and virulence-related traits are maintained by selective pressures imposed by protist predation.

AB Perovskite-based oxides are used in electrochemical CO2 and H2O reduction in electrochemical cells due to their compositional versatility, redox properties, and stability. However, limited knowledge exists on the mechanisms driving these processes. Toward this understanding, herein we probe the core level binding energy shifts of water-derived adspecies (H, O, OH, H2O) as well as the adsorption of CO2 on LaCoO3 and LaNiO3 and correlate the simulated peaks with experimental temperature-programmed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (TPXPS) results. We find that the strong adsorption of such chemical species can affect the antiferromagnetic ordering of LaNiO3. The adsorption of such adspecies is further quantified through Bader and differential charge analyses. We find that the higher O 1s core level binding energy peak for both LaCoO3 and LaNiO3 corresponds to adsorption of water-related species and CO2, while the lower energy peak is due to lattice oxygen. We further correlate these density functional theory-based core level O 1s binding energies with the TPXPS measurements to quantify the decrease of the O 1s contribution due to desorption of adsorbates and the apparent increase of the lattice oxygen (both bulk and surface) with temperature. Finally, we quantify the influence of adsorbates on the La 4d, Co 2p, and the Ni 3p core level binding energy shifts. This work demonstrates how theoretically generated XPS data can be utilized to predict species-specific binding energy shifts to assist in deconvolution of the experimental results.

AB Chlorinated organic compounds are ubiquitous chemical intermediates, final products, and waste streams found in multiple industries. These compounds must often be dechlorinated prior to disposal to avoid negative consequences for environmental and human health. In this work, we employ kinetic experiments and density functional theory (DFT) to examine Pd-catalyzed chlorobenzene hydrogenolysis, which is highly selective for the formation of benzene (>95 %). Kinetic data (353 K, 10-101 kPa H-2, 0.2-1.1 kPa C6H2Cl, 0.5-1 kPa HCl) on 5 wt% Pd/C catalysts revealed rates that are first-order, half-order, and inverse first-order with respect to PhCl, H-2, and HCl, respectively. These kinetic trends are consistent with PhCl dechlorination as the kinetically relevant step occurring at a single site on surfaces saturated by Cl adatoms (Cl*) in equilibrium with H-2 and HCl, consistent with previous reports in the literature. However, the nature of this C-Cl bond activation has not been well-described in the prior literature, because forming adsorbed Ph* and Cl* typically requires two sites, yet the kinetic trends suggest that only a single site is needed. Here, we resolve this inconsistency using theory, which shows that Cl* saturates Pd surfaces at a Cl*:Pd-surf ratio of ca. 0.3-0.4. This low saturation coverage enables Ph* (and other species) to bind interstitially among the Cl* adatoms without requiring Cl* desorption. Theory furthermore confirms that the reaction occurs through a rate-determining PhCl dechlorination, without any C-H activation of the phenyl ring. This non-competitive binding of Ph* among Cl* adatoms can be described as a two-site mechanism that agrees with the kinetic, isotopic, and theoretical data from this and prior work.

AB Understanding how and when key novel adaptations evolved is a central goal of evolutionary biology. Within the immigrans-tripunctata radiation of Drosophila, many mushroom-feeding species are tolerant of host toxins, such as cyclopeptides, that are lethal to nearly all other eukaryotes. In this study, we used phylogenetic and functional approaches to investigate the evolution of cyclopeptide tolerance in the immigrans-tripunctata radiation of Drosophila. First, we inferred the evolutionary relationships among 48 species in this radiation using 978 single copy orthologs. Our results resolved previous incongruities within species groups across the phylogeny. Second, we expanded on previous studies of toxin tolerance by assaying 16 of these species for tolerance to alpha-amanitin and found that six of them could develop on diet with toxin. Finally, we asked how alpha-amanitin tolerance might have evolved across the immigrans-tripunctata radiation, and inferred that toxin tolerance was ancestral in mushroom-feeding Drosophila and subsequently lost multiple times. Our findings expand our understanding of toxin tolerance across the immigrans-tripunctata radiation and emphasize the uniqueness of toxin tolerance in this adaptive radiation and the complexity of biochemical adaptations.

ID FUNDAMENTAL LIMITS; CAPACITY
AB Cache-aided Multiuser Private Information Retrieval (MuPIR) is an approach to achieve efficient file retrieval while ensuring multiuser demand privacy against curious servers in multiuser cache-aided PIR systems. More specifically, the demands of the users should be protected from any individual server (i.e., server privacy) during the two-phase retrieval procedure which consists of a cache placement phase and a private delivery phase. One limitation of the MuPIR model is that the users' demands are exposed to each other which is highly undesirable in modern-day distributed retrieval systems where user-to-user privacy has also become an important consideration. Motivated by this, we propose cache-aided MuPIR with user privacy (MuPIR-U), a new problem formulation that simultaneously enforces server privacy and user-to-user privacy. Besides server privacy, it is also required that each user should be prevented from learning other users' demands. We present an optimal scheme for the case of two files and an arbitrary number of users and servers which leverages private cache to achieve demand privacy among users. Interestingly, it is shown that the inclusion of user-to-user privacy incurs no extra download cost in the large memory regime when comparing to MuPIR.

AB Damage and disruption from flooding have rapidly escalated over recent decades. Knowing who and what is at risk, how these risks are changing, and what is driving these changes is of immense importance to flood management and policy. Accurate predictions of flood risk are also critical to public safety. However, many high-profile research studies reporting risks at national and global scales rely upon a significant oversimplification of how floods behave-as a level pool-an approach known as bathtub modeling that is avoided in flood management practice due to known biases (e.g., >200% error in flood area) compared to physics-based modeling. With publicity by news media, findings that would likely not be trusted by flood management professionals are thus widely communicated to policy makers and the public, scientific credibility is put at risk, and maladaptation becomes more likely. Here, we call upon researchers to abandon the practice of bathtub modeling in flood risk studies, and for those involved in the peer-review process to ensure the conclusions of impact analyses are consistent with the limitations of the assumed flood physics. We document biases and uncertainties from bathtub modeling in both coastal and inland geographies, and we present examples of physics-based modeling approaches suited to large-scale applications. Reducing biases and uncertainties in flood hazard estimates will sharpen scientific understanding of changing risks, better serve the needs of policy makers, enable news media to more objectively report present and future risks to the public, and better inform adaptation planning.

TI A data-driven approach to analyze bubble deformation in turbulence
SO PHYSICS OF FLUIDS
LA English
DT Article
ID LEVEL SET FORMULATION
AB Bubble deformation and breakup from turbulence is present in many engineering applications and in nature, yet the physical mechanisms still remain poorly understood. Depending on the local turbulence intensity or Weber number, a bubble may either deform without breakup, suffer a violent breakup, or exhibit a resonant behavior, where the turbulent eddies excite the bubble's natural frequencies. Recent studies have used spherical harmonic decomposition to analyze bubble interaction with turbulence, quantifying the deformation energy of each eigenmode. However, this approach is only applicable for small levels of deformation (linear regime), while the bubble shape remains close to a sphere. In the present work, we present a novel data-driven approach combining large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping and proper orthogonal decomposition, which is more robust for large deformations. The method is tested on a set of validation cases and applied to turbulent bubble deformation cases obtained from direct numerical simulations data.

ID FRAMEWORK; MEDICINE
AB Adversarial contrastive learning (ACL) is a technique that enhances standard contrastive learning (SCL) by incorporating adversarial data to learn a robust representation that can withstand adversarial attacks and common corruptions without requiring costly annotations. To improve transferability, the existing work introduced the standard invariant regularization (SIR) to impose style-independence property to SCL, which can exempt the impact of nuisance style factors in the standard representation. However, it is unclear how the style-independence property benefits ACL-learned robust representations. In this paper, we leverage the technique of causal reasoning to interpret the ACL and propose adversarial invariant regularization (AIR) to enforce independence from style factors. We regulate the ACL using both SIR and AIR to output the robust representation. Theoretically, we show that AIR implicitly encourages the representational distance between different views of natural data and their adversarial variants to be independent of style factors. Empirically, our experimental results show that invariant regularization significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art ACL methods in terms of both standard generalization and robustness on downstream tasks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply causal reasoning to interpret ACL and develop AIR for enhancing ACL-learned robust representations.

AB Advancement of sulfur (S) cathode of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries is hindered by issues such as insulating nature of sulfur, sluggish redox kinetics, polysulfide dissolution and shuttling. To address these issues, we initiate a study on applying an important amino acid of protein, arginine (Arg), as a functional additive into S cathode. Based on our simulation study, the positively charged Arg facilitates strong interactions with polysulfides. The experimental results indicate that the interaction enable capability of trapping polysulfides within the S cathode, responsible for reducing shuttle effects. Furthermore, the positively charged Arg also promotes efficient ion diffusion and polysulfides conversion. The new findings include that, with addition of only 1 wt % Arg, the resultant cathode demonstrates effectively enhanced electrolyte wettability, polysulfide adsorption and redox kinetics, leading to enhanced rate performance and long-term cycling stability. This study highlights the great potential of amino acids being able to act as effective functional bio-additives in S cathode, paving a new way to high-performance and sustainable energy storage solutions.

AB The rapid reduction in the cost of renewable energy has motivated the transition from carbon-intensive chemical manufacturing to renewable, electrified, and decarbonized technologies. Although electrified chemical manufacturing technologies differ greatly, the feasibility of each electrified approach is largely related to the energy efficiency and capital cost of the system. Here, we examine the feasibility of ammonia production systems driven by wind and photovoltaic energy. We identify the optimal regions where wind and photovoltaic electricity production may be able to meet the local demand for ammonia-based fertilizers and set technology targets for electrified ammonia production. To compete with the methane-fed Haber-Bosch process, electrified ammonia production must reach energy efficiencies of above 20% for high natural gas prices and 70% for low natural gas prices. To account for growing concerns regarding access to water, geospatial optimization considers water stress caused by new ammonia facilities, and recommendations ensure that the identified regions do not experience an increase in water stress. Reducing water stress by 99% increases costs by only 1.4%. Furthermore, a movement toward a more decentralized ammonia supply chain driven by wind and photovoltaic electricity can reduce the transportation distance for ammonia by up to 76% while increasing production costs by 18%.

AB Intense lasers enable generating high-energy particle beams in university-scale laboratories. With the direct laser acceleration (DLA) method, the leading part of the laser pulse ionizes the target material and forms a positively charged ion plasma channel into which electrons are injected and accelerated. The high energy conversion efficiency of DLA makes it ideal for generating large numbers of photonuclear reactions. In this work, we reveal that, for efficient DLA to prevail, a target material of sufficiently high atomic number is required to maintain the injection of ionization electrons at the peak intensity of the pulse when the DLA channel is already formed. We demonstrate experimentally and numerically that, when the atomic number is too low, the target is depleted of its ionization electrons prematurely. Applying this understanding to multi-petawatt laser experiments is expected to result in increased neutron yields, a perquisite for a wide range of research and applications.

AB Data-driven modeling is useful for reconstructing nonlinear dynamical systems when the underlying process is unknown or too expensive to compute. Having reliable uncertainty assessment of the forecast enables tools to be deployed to predict new scenarios unobserved before. In this work, we first extend parallel partial Gaussian processes for predicting the vector-valued transition function that links the observations between the current and next time points, and quantify the uncertainty of predictions by posterior sampling. Second, we show the equivalence between the dynamic mode decomposition and the maximum likelihood estimator of the linear mapping matrix in the linear state space model. The connection provides a probabilistic generative model of dynamic mode decomposition and thus, uncertainty of predictions can be obtained. Furthermore, we draw close connections between different data-driven models for approximating nonlinear dynamics, through a unified view of generative models. We study two numerical examples, where the inputs of the dynamics are assumed to be known in the first example and the inputs are unknown in the second example. The examples indicate that uncertainty of forecast can be properly quantified, whereas model or input misspecification can degrade the accuracy of uncertainty quantification.

AB Leopard seals have traditionally been considered Antarctic predators with a Southern Ocean distribution. Historically, sightings north of the Antarctic Polar Front were considered extralimital. However, recent studies suggest a significant presence of leopard seals in subantarctic regions. Here, we assess the spatial occurrence, residency status, and temporal trends of leopard seals in Chile using historical records, stranding reports, standardized monitoring data, photo-identification (photo ID) catalogs, and sightings from four research expeditions. We also characterize glaciers where sightings are concentrated, identifying glaciological and geomorphic attributes that prolong iceberg residency time, which is linked to high leopard seal concentrations. Based on these attributes, we evaluated other potential suitable glacial habitats in Patagonia. We obtained 438 sighting records of leopard seals from 1927 to 2023. Over the last 15 years, we documented a 4-18% annual increase in stranding events reported to national authorities. Most sightings (75%) were concentrated in two hotspots: National Park San Rafael Lagoon, located in Northern Patagonia, and Parry Fjord in Tierra del Fuego. Using photo ID catalogs, we identified 19 resident leopard seals, including 16 multi-year residents observed between 2010-2023 (10 in San Rafael, 6 in Tierra del Fuego) and 3 potential residents (observed multiple months in the same year in Tierra del Fuego). San Rafael monitoring data showed no inter-annual trend, but seasonal trends were observed. We also provide evidence of breeding in Chile, with records of at least 14 pups born and at least two females giving birth in multiple years. Our habitat characterization suggests that calving flux, fjord sinuosity, and fjord width variation are crucial for prolonging iceberg residency in hotspot areas. Based on these attributes, we identified 13 additional fjords in Patagonia as "very likely" suitable for leopard seals. Our study confirms that Patagonia is part of the species' breeding distribution, shifting the paradigm that leopard seals are merely visitors north of the Antarctic Polar Front. Given the limited number of suitable glaciers in Chile and the potential impacts of climate change, our assessment highlights glacial retreat as a major threat for the ecosystem of this pagophilic marine apex predator in South America.

AB The BEST Collaboration equation of state combining lattice data with the 3D Ising critical point encounters limitations due to the truncated Taylor expansion up to mu(B)/T similar to 2.5. This truncation consequently restricts its applicability at high densities. Through a resummation scheme, the lattice results have been extended to mu(B)/T = 3.5. In this article, we amalgamate these ideas with the 3DIsing model, yielding a family of equations of state valid up to mu(B) = 700MeV with the correct critical behavior. Our equations of state feature tunable parameters, providing a stable and causal framework-a crucial tool for hydrodynamics simulations.

AB Climate change poses significant challenges to agricultural management, particularly in adapting to extreme weather conditions that impact agricultural production. Existing works with traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods often falter under such extreme conditions. To address this challenge, our study introduces a novel approach by integrating Continual Learning (CL) with RL to form Continual Reinforcement Learning (CRL), enhancing the adaptability of agricultural management strategies. Leveraging the Gym-DSSAT simulation environment, our research enables RL agents to learn optimal fertilization strategies based on variable weather conditions. By incorporating CL algorithms, such as Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), with established RL techniques like Deep Q-Networks (DQN), we developed a framework in which agents can learn and retain knowledge across diverse weather scenarios. The CRL approach was tested under climate variability to assess the robustness and adaptability of the induced policies, particularly under extreme weather events like severe droughts. Our results showed that continually learned policies exhibited superior adaptability and performance compared to optimal policies learned through the conventional RL methods, especially in challenging conditions of reduced rainfall and increased temperatures. This pioneering work, which combines CL with RL to generate adaptive policies for agricultural management, is expected to make significant advancements in precision agriculture in the era of climate change.

AB The modified quasichemical model in the quadruplet approximation (MQMQA) considers the first-and the second-nearest-neighbor coordination and interactions, particularly useful in describing short-range ordering (SRO) in complex liquids such as molten salts, slag in metal processing, and electrolytic solutions. The present work implements the MQMQA into the Python based open-source software PyCalphad for thermodynamic calculations. This endeavor facilitates the development of MQMQA-based thermodynamic database with uncertainty quantification (UQ) and propagation (UP) using the open-source software ESPEI. A new database structure based on Extensible Markup Language (XML) is proposed for ESPEI evaluation of MQMQA model parameters. Using the KF-NiF2, KCl-NaCl-MgCl2, and CaCl2-CaF2- LiCl-LiF salt systems as examples, we demonstrate the successful implementation of MQMQA in PyCalphad through thermodynamic calculations of Gibbs energy, equilibrium quadruplet fractions, and phase diagram, as well as database development with UQ and UP using ESPEI. Furthermore, as an application of the present implementation, both the LiF-TbF3 and LiF-HoF3 systems have been modeled by MQMQA for the first time, which are in good agreement with experiments. The present implementation hence offers an open-source capability for performing CALPHAD modeling for complex liquids with SRO using MQMQA plus a new XML database structure.

AB The ages of the oldest stars shed light on the birth, chemical enrichment, and chemical evolution of the universe. Nucleocosmochronometry provides an avenue to determining the ages of these stars independent from stellar-evolution models. The uranium abundance, which can be determined for metal-poor r-process enhanced (RPE) stars, has been known to constitute one of the most robust chronometers known. So far, U abundance determination has used a single U ii line at lambda 3859 angstrom. Consequently, U abundance has been reliably determined for only five RPE stars. Here, we present the first homogeneous U abundance analysis of four RPE stars using two novel U ii lines at lambda 4050 angstrom and lambda 4090 angstrom, in addition to the canonical lambda 3859 angstrom line. We find that the U ii lines at lambda 4050 angstrom and lambda 4090 angstrom are reliable and render U abundances in agreement with the lambda 3859 U abundance, for all of the stars. We, thus, determine revised U abundances for RPE stars, 2MASS J09544277+5246414, RAVE J203843.2-002333, HE 1523-0901, and CS 31082-001, using multiple U ii lines. We also provide nucleocosmochronometric ages of these stars based on the newly derived U, Th, and Eu abundances. The results of this study open up a new avenue to reliably and homogeneously determine U abundance for a significantly larger number of RPE stars. This will, in turn, enable robust constraints on the nucleocosmochronometric ages of RPE stars, which can be applied to understand the chemical enrichment and evolution in the early universe, especially of r-process elements.

AB Designing innovative microstructures and implementing efficient multicomponent strategies are still challenging to achieve high-performance and chemo-mechanically stable electrode materials. Herein, a hierarchical three-dimensional (3D) graphene oxide (GO) assisted Ti3C2Tx MXene aerogel foam (MXene-GAF) impregnated with battery-type bimetallic nickel vanadium selenide (NiVSe) has been prepared through a hydrothermal method followed by freeze-drying (denoted as NiVSe-MXene-GAF). 3D-oriented cellular pore networks benefit the energy storage process through the effective lodging of NiVSe particles, improving the access of the electrolyte to the active sites, and alleviating volume changes during redox reactions. The 3D MXene-GAF conductive matrix and heterostructured interface of MXene-rGO and NiVSe facilitated the rapid transport of electrical charges and ions during the charge-discharge process. As a result of the synergism of these effects, NiVSe-MXene-GAF exhibited remarkable electrochemical performance with a specific capacity of 305.8 mA h g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) and 99.2% initial coulombic efficiency. The NiVSe-MXene-GAF electrode delivered a specific capacity of 235.1 mA h g(-1) even at a high current density of 12 A g(-1) with a 76.8% rate performance. The impedance measurements indicated a low bulk solution resistance (Rs = 0.71 Omega) for NiVSe-MXene-GAF. Furthermore, the structural robustness of NiVSe-MXene-GAF guaranteed long-term stability with a 91.7% capacity retention for successive 7000 cycles. Thus, developing NiVSe-MXene-GAF provides a progressive strategy for fabricating high-performance 3D heterostructured electrode materials for energy storage applications.

AB The high-pressure Pbnm-perovskite polymorph of MgSiO3, i.e., bridgmanite (Bm), plays a crucial role in the Earth's lower mantle. It is likely responsible for similar to 75 vol. % of this region and its properties dominate the properties of this region, especially its elastic properties that are challenging to measure at ambient conditions. This study combines deep-learning potential (DP) with density-functional theory (DFT) to investigate the structural and elastic properties of Bm under lower-mantle conditions. To simulate this system, we developed a series of potentials capable of faithfully reproducing DFT calculations using different functionals, i.e., local density approximation (LDA), Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof parametrization (PBE), revised PBE for solids (PBEsol), and strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) meta-generalized-gradient approximation functionals. Our predictions with DP-SCAN exhibit a remarkable agreement with experimental measurements of high-temperature equations of states and elastic properties and highlight its superior performance, closely followed by DP-LDA in accurately predicting. This hybrid computational approach offers a solution to the accuracy-efficiency dilemma in obtaining precise elastic properties at high pressure and temperature conditions for minerals like Bm, opening a way to study the Earth material's thermodynamic properties and related phenomena.

AB Molecular simulations are commonly used to understand the mechanism of membrane permeation of small molecules, particularly for biomedical and pharmaceutical applications. However, despite significant advances in computing power and algorithms, calculating an accurate permeation free energy profile remains elusive for many drug molecules because it can require identifying the rate-limiting degrees of freedom (i.e., appropriate reaction coordinates). To resolve this issue, researchers have developed machine learning approaches to identify slow system dynamics. In this work, we apply time-lagged independent component analysis (tICA), an unsupervised dimensionality reduction algorithm, to molecular dynamics simulations with well-tempered metadynamics to find the slowest collective degrees of freedom of the permeation process of trimethoprim through a multicomponent membrane. We show that tICA-metadynamics yields translational and orientational collective variables (CVs) that increase convergence efficiency similar to 1.5 times. However, crossing the periodic boundary is shown to introduce artifacts in the translational CV that can be corrected by taking absolute values of molecular features. Additionally, we find that the convergence of the tICA CVs is reached with approximately five membrane crossings and that data reweighting is required to avoid deviations in the translational CV.

AB This study explores the iodine and nickel-doped cobalt hydroxide (I & Ni-co-doped-Co(OH)2) as a potential material for energy storage and conversion applications owing to its excellent electrochemical characteristics. According to our analysis, it was revealed that this material exhibits pseudocapacitive-like behavior, as evident from distinct redox peaks observed in cyclic voltammetry, which confirms its ability to store charges. The diffusion coefficient analysis reveals that this material possesses conductivity and rapid diffusion kinetics, making it particularly advantageous compared to materials synthesized in previous studies. Charge-discharge measurements were performed to analyze the charge storage capacity and stability of this material after 3000 consecutive cycles, showing its excellent stability with minimum loss of capacitance. Furthermore, its anodic and cathodic linear sweep voltammetry curves were measured to evaluate its oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reaction performance. The results showed that the material exhibited an excellent water splitting performance, which suggests its potential practical application for hydrogen production. This increased activity was attributed to the doping of alpha-Co(OH)2, which improved its structural stability, electrical conductivity, and charge transfer efficiency. Thus, I & Ni-co-doped-Co(OH)2 possesses enhanced properties that make it an excellent material for both energy storage and hydrogen generation applications.

AB A straightforward and general strategy for the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of beta(3)-tryptophans by carboxylic-acid-directed intermolecular C-H amination has been developed. The iron-catalyzed C-H amination of 3-indolepropionic acids with BocNHOMs (Boc, tert-butyloxycarbonyl; OMs, methylsulfonate) in the presence of the base piperidine provides N-Boc-protected beta(3)-tryptophans in a single step with high enantiomeric excess (ee) of up to >99%. Mechanistic experiments and density functional theory calculations support a mechanism through carboxylate-directed iron-mediated C(sp(3))-H nitrene insertion. The method incorporates two key sustainability criteria: the use of iron as an abundant, non-toxic, and environmentally benign metal, along with the achievement of streamlined enantioselective C-H functionalization.

AB A novel protocol utilizing a phase-field model was used to process the reconstruction of a polycrystalline microstructure from synchrotron-based high-energy X-ray diffraction microscopy. This approach is an intuitive and standardized alternative to typical image processing routines. It preserves high-confidence regions by deploying a completeness-based mobility parameter in the phase-field model. Phase-field governing equations result in a space-filling grain map that adheres to the physics of the microstructure, i.e., it penalizes high-energy grain shapes and configurations and promotes grain boundary (GB) smoothing. We quantify GB smoothing by measuring, in 2D, the circularity of interior grains and the tortuosity of individual GBs. Results are also presented in 3D. This post-processing protocol can be applied to any X-ray diffraction microscopy reconstruction that consists of a spatial map of grains and corresponding confidence values. Furthermore, it can be adapted to accommodate other types of microstructures, including those that are polyphase.

AB Phyllobilins, derived from the breakdown of chlorophyll in plants, are acyclic tetrapyrroles that bear the signature ring E of the parent macrocycle. Few synthetic studies have concerned members of this emergent class of natural products, which now number >70. A prior synthesis of southern rim structures relied on Knoevenagel and Nazarov reactions to construct a dipyrromethane bearing the annulated ring E. Here, the synthesis has been extended to linear tetrapyrroles containing ring E as well as an appended dicyanovinyl unit. The latter serves as an optical marker with clearly observable absorption near 400 nm, rendering all compounds yellow, orange or red, thereby facilitating isolation and reaction monitoring. Knoevenagel condensation was carried out with a DC half (gem-dimethyl-substituted dihydrodipyrrin-1-carboxaldehyde bearing a 9-carboethoxy group) and an AB half (dipyrromethane equipped with a beta-ketoester at the 8-position and the dicyanovinyl group at the 1-position). The resulting propenone is blocked by the ester and dicyanovinyl groups from reactions at the respective pyrrolic termini. Subsequent Yb(OTf)(3)-catalyzed Nazarov reaction accompanied by unexpected prototropic rearrangement afforded the isolated phyllobilin (8) wherein conjugation shifted from the DC dihydrodipyrrin moiety to the CB southern rim, thereby resembling the conjugation of a native phyllolumibilin. The expected direct products of Nazarov cyclization, the cis and trans products (pre-8-cis, pre-8-trans) due to the configuration of substituents in ring E, were not observed. Calculations by density functional theory showed the stability order as 8 > pre-8-trans > pre-8-cis. Access to phyllobilin analogues may open opportunities for fundamental studies pertaining to the native constituents, which are germane to plant sciences, nutrition, and ecology.

AB Identifying optimal reaction coordinates for complex conformational changes and protein folding remains an outstanding challenge. This study combines collective variable (CV) discovery based on chemical intuition and machine learning with enhanced sampling to converge the folding free energy landscape of lasso peptides, a unique class of natural products with knot-like tertiary structures. This knotted scaffold imparts remarkable stability, making lasso peptides resistant to proteolytic degradation, thermal denaturation, and extreme pH conditions. Although their direct synthesis would enable therapeutic design, it has not yet been possible due to the improbable occurrence of spontaneous lasso folding. Thus, simulations characterizing the folding propensity are needed to identify strategies for increasing access to the lasso architecture by stabilizing the pre-lasso ensemble before isopeptide bond formation. Herein, harmonic linear discriminant analysis (HLDA) is combined with metadynamics-enhanced sampling to discover CVs capable of distinguishing the pre-lasso fold and converging the folding propensity. Intuitive CVs are compared to iterative rounds of HLDA to identify CVs that not only accomplish these goals for one lasso peptide but also seem to be transferable to others, establishing a protocol for the identification of folding reaction coordinates for lasso peptides.

AB An important question that is being increasingly studied across subdisciplines of Heliophysics is "how do mesoscale phenomena contribute to the global response of the system?" This review paper focuses on this question within two specific but interlinked regions in Near-Earth space: the magnetotail's transition region to the inner magnetosphere and the ionosphere. There is a concerted effort within the Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM) community to understand the degree to which mesoscale transport in the magnetotail contributes to the global dynamics of magnetic flux transport and dipolarization, particle transport and injections contributing to the storm-time ring current development, and the substorm current wedge. Because the magnetosphere-ionosphere is a tightly coupled system, it is also important to understand how mesoscale transport in the magnetotail impacts auroral precipitation and the global ionospheric system response. Groups within the Coupling, Energetics and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions Program (CEDAR) community have also been studying how the ionosphere-thermosphere responds to these mesoscale drivers. These specific open questions are part of a larger need to better characterize and quantify mesoscale "messengers" or "conduits" of information-magnetic flux, particle flux, current, and energy-which are key to understanding the global system. After reviewing recent progress and open questions, we suggest datasets that, if developed in the future, will help answer these questions.

AB We report the synthesis of catechol-functionalized symmetric triblock polymers comprising densely functionalized catechol endblocks using anionic ring-opening polymerization (AROP) and thiol-ene click chemistry. The simplicity and modularity of our approach rely on a two-step synthesis that eliminates the need for catechol protection and enables the functionalization of precisely synthesized precursor polymers with catechol-containing thiols. Partial oxidation of the catechols on the triblock polymers to quinones enabled rapid gelation (within seconds) while retaining strong adhesive attributes.

   Nonparametric dimension reduction
ID BART
AB In the emerging field of materials informatics, a fundamental task is to identify physicochemically meaningful descriptors, or materials genes, which are engineered from primary features and a set of elementary algebraic operators through compositions. Standard practice directly analyzes the high-dimensional candidate predictor space in a linear model; statistical analyses are then substantially hampered by the daunting challenge posed by the astronomically large number of correlated predictors with limited sample size. We formulate this problem as variable selection with operator-induced structure (OIS) and propose a new method to achieve unconventional dimension reduction by using the geometry embedded in OIS. Although the model remains linear, we iterate nonparametric variable selection for effective dimension reduction. This enables variable selection based on ab initio primary features, leading to a method that is orders of magnitude faster than existing methods, with improved accuracy. To select the nonparametric module, we discuss a desired performance criterion that is uniquely induced by variable selection with OIS; in particular, we propose to employ a Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART)-based variable selection method. Numerical studies show superiority of the proposed method, which continues to exhibit robust performance when the input dimension is out of reach of existing methods. Our analysis of single-atom catalysis identifies physical descriptors that explain the binding energy of metal-support pairs with high explanatory power, leading to interpretable insights to guide the prevention of a notorious problem called sintering and aid catalysis design. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.

AB Using numerical relativity simulations with a subgrid dynamo prescription to generate strong initial magnetic fields, we investigate the possibility of launching a jet-like outflow from the hypermassive neutron star (HMNS) during the early stages of the merger, prior to the remnant's collapse to a black hole. We demonstrate that buoyant instabilities in the strongly magnetized HMNS can lead to a periodic emission of powerful electromagnetic flares shortly after the merger. These are followed by a collimated mildly relativistic outflow. Both types of outflows feature quasiperiodic kilohertz substructure. These early-time outflows may power precursors to short-duration gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) or in some cases the entire sGRB. While the overall temporal power spectrum we find broadly agrees with the one recently reported for quasiperiodic oscillations in the sGRB GRB910711, our simulations suggest that the periodic electromagnetic substructure is dominated by magnetohydrodynamic shearing processes rather than correlating with the corresponding postmerger gravitational-wave signal.

AB The segregation energy of oxygen interstitial solutes to grain boundaries (GBs) in hexagonal close-packed (HCP) titanium is investigated through atomistic simulations based on a machine-learning interatomic potential (MLIP). The Ti-O MLIP is developed for titanium with interstitial oxygen solutes up to a concentration of 20 at.%. It is based on the formalism of the atomic cluster expansion (ACE), trained on an extensive dataset of density functional theory calculations exploring over 200,000 atomic environments for Ti and O interstitials. The ACE MLIP is used to compute oxygen GB segregation energies in 4685 different symmetric tilt GBs with [0001], [1100] and [1210] tilt axes. The segregation energies span a range of -0.2 eV to 2.0 eV, and over 90% of the 4685 GBs display one or more sites with negative (attractive) segregation energies. The lowest-energy sites are found to be those with coordination numbers and Voronoi indices most similar to that of the equilibrium octahedral site in the bulk HCP Ti structure. We further explore the efficacy of crystal-graph convolutional neural network ML models for predicting segregation energies based solely on information about the local atomic environment.

AB We theoretically consider bilayers of two-dimensional (2D) electron gases as in semiconductor quantum wells, and investigate possible spontaneous symmetry breaking transitions at low carrier densities driven by interlayer Coulomb interactions. We use a self -consistent technique implementing mean -field truncations of the interacting four-fermion terms, and find a U(1) layer symmetry breaking transition at low carrier densities where the individual layer identities are lost leading to an effective pseudospin XY ferromagnet in the 2D plane. Our results validate earlier theoretical studies using simpler restricted Hartree-Fock techniques, and establish the pseudospin XY ferromagnet as a possible low -density symmetry broken phase of 2D bilayers.

AB Expansionmicroscopy (ExM) is a rapidly emerging super-resolutionmicroscopy technique that involves isotropic expansion of biologicalsamples to improve spatial resolution. However, fluorescence signaldilution due to volumetric expansion is a hindrance to the widespreadapplication of ExM. Here, we introduce plasmon-enhanced expansionmicroscopy (p-ExM) by harnessing an ultrabright fluorescent nanoconstruct,called plasmonic-fluor (PF), as a nanolabel. The unique structureof PFs renders nearly 15000-fold brighter fluorescence signal intensityand higher fluorescence retention following the ExM protocol (nearly76%) compared to their conventional counterparts (<16% for IR-650).Individual PFs can be easily imaged using conventional fluorescencemicroscopes, making them excellent "digital" labelsfor ExM. We demonstrate that p-ExM enables improved tracing and decryptingof neural networks labeled with PFs, as evidenced by improved quantificationof morphological markers (nearly a 2.5-fold increase in number ofneurite terminal points). Overall, p-ExM complements the existingExM techniques for probing structure-function relationshipsof various biological systems.

AB Au nanoclusters often demonstrate useful optical properties such as visible/near-infrared photoluminescence, in addition to remarkable thermodynamic stability owing to their superatomic behavior. The smallest of the 8e- superatomic Au nanoclusters, Au11, has limited applications due to its lack of luminescence and relatively low stability. In this work, we investigate the introduction of a single Pt dopant to the center of a halide- and triphenylphosphine-ligated Au11 nanocluster, affording a cluster with a proposed molecular formula PtAu10(PPh3)7Br3. Electrochemical and spectroscopic analysis reveal an expansion of the HOMO-LUMO gap due to the Pt dopant, as well as relatively strong near-infrared (NIR) photoluminescence which is atypical for an M11 cluster (lambda max = 700 nm, Phi = 1.88 %). The Pt dopant additionally boosted photostability; more than tenfold. Lastly, we demonstrate the application of the PtAu10 cluster's NIR photoluminescence in the detection of the nitroaromatic compound 2,4-dinitrotoluene, with a limit-of-detection of 9.52 mu M (1.74 ppm). The notable ability of a single central Pt dopant to unlock photoluminescence in a non-luminescent nanocluster highlights the advantages of heterometal doping in the tuning of both the optical and thermodynamic properties of Au nanoclusters.

AB Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for analyzing materials. In this study, we employ GCNNs to examine structural characteristics of CuZr metallic glasses (MGs) and identify their states. We use molecular dynamics to simulate the quenching process of CuZr, using cooling rates ranging from 109 to 1015 K/s to produce six unique glassy states. For each state, we create a dataset comprising 1,800 distinct samples. We evaluate the effectiveness of various GCNNs, including Graph Attention Neural Network (GANN), Graph Sample and AggreGatE (GraphSAGE), Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN), and Relational Graph Convolutional Neural Network (RGCN). GANN and GraphSAGE demonstrate comparable performance, achieving an overall accuracy of 81 % in classifying the MG states. These results underscore the potential of GCNNs to detect subtle structural variances in disordered materials and point to broader application of deep learning in the analysis of MGs and other amorphous substances.

AB Peptides capable of forming homotetrameric coiled-coil bundles are utilized as monomeric building blocks ("bundlemers") to synthesize protein-like hybrid polymers consisting of covalently linked coiled-coil microdomains with regularly spaced ethylene glycol repeats via step-growth polymerization employing the highly efficient, bioorthogonal tetrazine (Tz) ligation with trans-cyclooctene (TCO). Polymerization of Tz and TCO-functionalized peptides in aqueous media under strict stoichiometry at Tz or TCO concentrations of 0.1 to 4.5 mM leads to the establishment of exceptionally long, semiflexible polymer chains with a Kuhn length of 6-7 nm and an apparent molecular weight up to 3 MDa. Bioorthogonal polymerization at bundlemer concentrations above 5 mM gives rise to physical gels through interchain entanglements. Hydrogels prepared at 10 mM exhibit an average elastic modulus of 400 Pa and a strain to failure of 300%. Copolymerization of coiled-coil peptides with distinct composition and thermal stability results in hydrogels that are thermally tunable. A solid-to-fluid transition occurs when one of the coiled-coil repeats melts. Upon cooling, solid-like properties are partially recovered through the intermolecular association of the helical peptides. Overall, tetrazine ligation has enabled the covalent polymerization of self-assembled coiled-coil motifs for the establishment of protein-like linear polymers with unprecedented molecular weight.

AB Boron is commonly added to superalloys in small amounts to enhance creep resistance, but can lead to cracking at high concentrations, especially during the additive manufacturing process. Two variants of CoNi-based GammaPrint (R)-700 (R)-700 superalloy with different B contents (0.08 at% vs 0.16 at%) were printed via laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) with the same printing parameters, with only the high B alloy exhibiting solidification cracking. Atom probe tomography (APT) revealed stronger segregation behaviors in the high B alloy compared to the low B alloy at both the inter-dendritic regions and grain boundaries (GBs). The segregation behavior at interdendritic regions was well captured with Scheil simulation and can correlate with the existing cracking susceptibility index (CSI) on cracking tendencies, although high angle GBs are where cracking occurs according to electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) measurements. Additionally, the extent of GB segregation was compared between the high B and low B alloy. Higher B additions led to significantly more GB B segregation in the high B alloy compared to the low B alloy. For the high B alloy, the cracked region of one GB exhibited higher levels of B compared to the uncracked region of the same GB. However, much higher B contents were also found in two other uncracked GBs in the high B alloy, which demonstrates that higher GB B concentrations are not fully responsible for the cracking. A much larger variance in GB B segregation content was found in the high B alloy compared to the low B alloy. These phenomena were explained with a solidification model with the GB segregation content expressed explicitly by a modified Langmuir-McLean equation. This model linked the GB segregation content with solidification undercooling, which can be used as quantitative cracking criteria for future builds.

ID EDUCATION
AB The career paths of PhD scientists often deviate from their doctoral theses. As a result, the need to integrate student-centered career and professional development training is important to meet the needs of doctoral students. Qualifying exams (QEs) represent a significant milestone in progression toward graduation within most PhD Programs in the United States. These exams are commonly administered 2-3 years into a PhD program following the completion of coursework, with the primary objective of evaluating whether the candidate possesses the necessary knowledge and skills to progress with their dissertation research. To enhance the value of QEs and intentionally align them with the diverse career trajectories of our students, we explored the inclusion of student-centered assessments in a track with a Pharmaceutical Sciences PhD program. In this PhD program, one component of QEs is a series of monthly, written cumulative exams focused on recent scientific literature in the faculty and students' discipline. To create a student-centered QE, the student and a faculty member collaborated to develop personalized assessments focused on career exploration and in alignment with individual student's career goals. All students enrolled in the PhD track (n = 8) were invited to participate in a survey about their experience with the redesigned QE. A combination of Likert scale and short answer questions were collected; quantitative items were analyzed with descriptive statistics and qualitative items with thematic coding. A subset of survey participants (n = 5) participated in a focus group regarding their experience with both the Traditional Model QE and the redesigned Pilot Model QE. Two faculty interviews were conducted regarding the design, content, procedures, and evaluation of student QEs. The study design and analysis were grounded in the cognitive apprenticeship framework, with a focus on how the QEs were situated within the four domains of this framework: content, methods, sequencing, and sociology. Results revealed that this student-centered QE approach was perceived to be more aligned with student career aspirations and to have a high interest level and value for students without placing a substantial additional burden on participants. This suggests that it is a feasible mechanism for integrating student-centered assessment into QEs.

TI Local geometry and quantum geometric tensor of mixed states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
LA English
DT Article
ID COMPUTATION; DISTANCE; VORTICES
AB The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) is a fundamental concept for characterizing the local geometry of quantum states. After casting the geometry of pure quantum states and extracting the QGT, we generalize the geometry to mixed quantum states via the density matrix and its purification. The gauge-invariant QGT of mixed states is derived, whose real and imaginary parts are the Bures metric and the Uhlmann form, respectively. In contrast to the imaginary part of the pure-state QGT that is proportional to the Berry curvature, the Uhlmann form vanishes identically for ordinary physical processes. Moreover, there exists a Pythagorean-like equation that links different local distances and reflect the underlying fibration. The Bures metric of mixed states is shown to reduce to the corresponding Fubini-Study metric of the ground states as temperature approaches zero, establishing a correspondence despite the different underlying fibrations. We also present two examples with contrasting local geometries and discuss experimental implications.

ID FORCE-FIELD; SIMULATION; GUI; PERSPECTIVE; INTERFACE; WATER
AB We present a general scheme for converting coarse-grained models into Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) models. We build the corresponding DPD models by analogy with the de novo DPD coarse-graining scheme suggested by Groot and Warren (J. Chem. Phys., 1997). Electrostatic interactions between charged DPD particles are represented though the addition of a long-range Slater Coulomb potential as suggested by Gonzalez-Melchor et al. (J. Chem. Phys., 2006). The construction is illustrated by converting MARTINI models for various proteins into a DPD representation, but it not restricted to the usual potential form in the MARTINI model-viz., Lennard-Jones potentials. We further extended the DPD scheme away from the typical use of homogeneous particle sizes, therefore faithfully representing the variations in the particle sizes seen in the underlying MARTINI model. The accuracy of the resulting construction of our generalized DPD models with respect to several structural observables has been benchmarked favorably against all-atom and MARTINI models for a selected set of peptides and proteins, and variations in the scales of the coarse-graining of the water solvent.

AB A suite of internally functionalized Fe4L6 cage complexes has been synthesized with lipophilic end groups to allow dissolution in varied solvent mixtures, and the scope of their molecular recognition of a series of neutral, nonpolar guests has been analyzed. The lipophilic end groups confer cage solubility in solvents with a wide range of polarities, from hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) to tetrahydrofuran, and the hosts show micromolar affinities for neutral guests, despite having no flat panels enclosing the cavity. These hosts allow interrogation of the effects of an internal functional group on guest binding properties, as well as solvent-based driving forces for recognition. Introducing polar effects to the interior of the cavity enhances guest binding affinity in nonpolar solvents; adding space-filling aliphatic groups reduces affinity in all cases. While high dielectric solvents such as acetonitrile strongly favor guest binding, "low dielectric, high polarity" solvents such as HFIP strongly occupy the cavity and prevent guest recognition. Analysis of the cage optical transitions shows that the guests interact with the central ligand cores and reside in close proximity to the internal functions. These results have implications for supramolecular catalysis: balancing directed host:guest interactions (e.g., H-bonds) with entropic effects from solvent displacement is essential for reactions in these (and related) biomimetic hosts.

AB In polymer physics, the concept of entanglement refers to the topological constraints between long polymer chains that are closely packed together. Both theory and experimentation suggest that entanglement has a significant influence on the mechanical properties of polymers. This indicates its promise for materials design across various applications. However, understanding the relationship between entanglement and mechanical properties is complex, especially due to challenges related to length scale constraints and the difficulties of direct experimental observation. This research delves into how the polymer network structure changes when deformed. We specifically examine the relationship between entanglement, crosslinked networks, and their roles in stretching both entangled and unentangled polymer systems. For unentangled polymers, our findings underscore the pivotal role of crosslinking bond strength in determining the system's overall strength and resistance to deformation. As for entangled polymers, entanglement plays a pivotal role in load bearing during the initial stretching stage, preserving the integrity of the polymer network. As the stretching continues and entanglement diminishes, the responsibility for bearing the load increasingly shifts to the crosslinking network, signifying a critical change in the system's behavior. We noted a linear correlation between the increase in entanglement and the rise in tensile stress during the initial stretching stage. Conversely, the destruction of the network correlates with a decrease in tensile stress in the later stage. The findings provide vital insights into the complex dynamics between entanglement and crosslinking in the stretching processes of polymer networks, offering valuable guidance for future manipulation and design of polymer materials to achieve desired mechanical properties.

AB Future wearable electronics and smart textiles face a major challenge in the development of energy storage devices that are high-performing while still being flexible, lightweight, and safe. Fiber supercapacitors are one of the most promising energy storage technologies for such applications due to their excellent electrochemical characteristics and mechanical flexibility. Over the past decade, researchers have put in tremendous effort and made significant progress on fiber supercapacitors. It is now the time to assess the outcomes to ensure that this kind of energy storage device will be practical for future wearable electronics and smart textiles. While the materials, fabrication methods, and energy storage performance of fiber supercapacitors have been summarized and evaluated in many previous publications, this review paper focuses on two practical questions: Are the reported devices providing sufficient energy and power densities to wearable electronics? Are the reported devices flexible and durable enough to be integrated into smart textiles? To answer the first question, we not only review the electrochemical performance of the reported fiber supercapacitors but also compare them to the power needs of a variety of commercial electronics. To answer the second question, we review the general approaches to assess the flexibility of wearable textiles and suggest standard methods to evaluate the mechanical flexibility and stability of fiber supercapacitors for future studies. Lastly, this article summarizes the challenges for the practical application of fiber supercapacitors and proposes possible solutions.

AB Engineering design entails making value-laden judgments against ill-defined, ambiguous, and/or competing sociotechnical criteria. In this article, we argue that such conditions make engineering designers particularly susceptible to the potentially deleterious effects of mis/disinformation in the processes and practices of engineering design, their engagement with people and communities, and in the production and evaluations of the artifacts they produce. We begin by critiquing dominant approaches to engineering design education, specifically, engineering education's social-technical dualism and the ubiquitous ideology of depoliticization, which has exacerbated the effects of mis/disinformation in engineering design. We follow by outlining a framework for developing students' capacity for mitigating its effects in the specific context of engineering design thinking and making value-laden engineering judgments and decision-making. We envision three areas of opportunity for engineering design education to teach students strategies for navigating these challenges when engaging with (a) the processes and practices of engineering, which reflect the unique types of information students engage with across the design process, (b) people and their communities, including the strategic and careful performance of activities for gathering information, while mitigating the harms to misinformation and disinformation and maximizing the benefits of community involvement, and (c) the social and technical criteria of engineering design outcomes in the form of artifacts (e.g., products, processes).

AB Traumatic brain injury remains a significant global health concern, requiring advanced understanding and mitigation strategies. In current brain concussion research, there is a significant knowledge gap: the critical role of transient cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow in the porous subarachnoid space (SAS) has long been overlooked. To address this limitation, we are developing a simplified mathematical model to investigate the CSF pressurization in the porous arachnoid trabeculae and the resulting motion of brain matter when the head is exposed to a translational impact. The model simplifies the head into an inner solid object (brain) and an outer rigid shell (skull) with a thin, porous fluid gap (SAS). The CSF flow in the impact side (coup region) and the opposite side (contrecoup region) is modeled as porous squeezing and expanding flows, respectively. The flow through the side regions, which connect these regions, is governed by Darcy's law. We found that the porous arachnoid trabeculae network significantly dampens brain motion and reduces pressure variations within the SAS compared to a SAS without the porous arachnoid trabeculae (AT). This effect is particularly pronounced under high-frequency, periodic acceleration impacts, thereby lowering the risk of injury. The dampening effect can be attributed to the low permeability of the AT, which increases resistance to fluid movement and stabilizes the fluid and pressure responses within the SAS, thereby reducing extreme pressure fluctuations and brain displacement under impact. This work provides a foundational understanding of CSF flow dynamics, paving the way for innovative approaches to brain injury prevention and management.

AB This study investigates the influence of tannic acid (TA), a natural plant-based biomolecule, on the hydration of tricalcium aluminate (C3A)-gypsum 3 A)-gypsum systems, aiming to elucidate its potential as a novel concrete strength enhancer. To this end, detailed investigations were conducted into the hydration and nano-mechanical properties of C3A-gypsum 3 A-gypsum system regarding the content of sulfate. In the absence of gypsum, the addition of TA accelerates the hydration of C3A, 3 A, leading to a 30.6 % increase in accumulated heat until 10 h. This acceleration is attributed to TA's intercalation with metastable hydration products, impeding their transformation into final hydrates (C3AH6). 3 AH 6 ). Characterization using XRD, TGA, and FTIR techniques confirms the presence of hexagonal hydrates as the main hydration products in C3A-TA 3 A-TA pastes, while the main hydration products in C3A-DI 3 A-DI pastes was cubic one. In scenarios involving gypsum, TA markedly retards the hydration of C3A-gypsum 3 A-gypsum mixtures, with SEM analysis indicating the promotion of AFt formation at low sulfate content while inhibiting its transformation to AFm. Furthermore, comprehensive nanoindentation results demonstrate that TA consistently enhances the micromechanical properties of C3A-gypsum 3 A-gypsum hydrates, irrespective of gypsum content. This study provides valuable insights into the mechanisms through which TA influences the hydration of C3A-gypsum 3 A-gypsum systems, offering promising avenues for enhancing the performance of concrete materials.

AB In recent years, batch and semi-batch reverse osmosis (RO) processes have received wide attention because of their internal staging feature. However their performance is severely compromised by salt retention induced by incomplete flushing, which leads to elevated salt concentration, uplifted peak pressure, and extra power consumption. Herein we adopt transient three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics to systematically analyze the effect of the V-shape feed spacer geometries on hydrodynamics and mass transfer characteristics. After a sensitivity analysis of all geometric parameters, a heuristic optimization framework is proposed for inverse design of the feed spacer. Using the optimized feed spacer, flushing efficacies after one displacement volume are 0.936, 0.962, 0.969 and 0.974 respectively for one, three, five and seven membrane elements connected in series (whereas 0.884, 0.926, 0.942 and 0.952 for commercial spacers), which help to mitigate membrane scaling and fouling. Moreover, the optimized spacer has a pressure drop per meter 73 % lower than that of the commercial spacer. If used in conjunction with high permeability membranes, batch RO and semi-batch RO could save 29.9 % and 24.1 % specific energy consumption relative to conventional one-stage seawater RO.

AB Attaining a complete thermodynamic and kinetic characterization for processes involving multiple interconnected rare-event transitions remains a central challenge in molecular biophysics. This challenge is amplified when the process must be understood under a range of reaction conditions. Herein, we present a novel condition-responsive kinetic modeling framework that can combine the strengths of bottom-up rate quantification from multiscale simulations with top-down solution refinement using both equilibrium and nonequilibrium experimental data. Although this framework can be applied to any process, we demonstrate its use for electrochemically driven transport through channels and transporters via the development of electrochemically responsive rates. Using the Cl-/H+ antiporter ClC-ec1 as a model system, we show how optimal and predictive kinetic solutions can be obtained when the solution space is grounded by thermodynamic constraints, seeded through multiscale rate quantification, and further refined with experimental data, such as electrophysiology assays. Turning to the Shaker K+ channel, we demonstrate that optimal solutions and biophysical insights can also be obtained with sufficient experimental data. This multi-pathway method also proves capable of identifying single-pathway dominant channel mechanisms but reveals that competing and off-pathway flux is still essential to replicate experimental findings and to describe concentration-dependent channel rectification.

AB The ability to observe intact proteins by native mass spectrometry allows measurements of size, oligomeric state, numbers and types of ligands and post translational modifications bound, among many other characteristics. These studies have the potential to, and in some cases are, advancing our understanding of the role of structure in protein biology and biochemistry. However, there are some long-unresolved questions about to what extent solution-like structures persist without solvent in the vacuum of the mass spectrometer. Strong evidence from multiple sources over the years has demonstrated that well-folded proteins maintain native-like states if care is taken during sample preparation, ionization, and transmission through the gas phase. For partially unfolded states, dynamic and disordered proteins, and other important landmarks along the protein folding/unfolding pathway, caution has been urged in the interpretation of the results of native ion mobility/mass spectrometric data. New gas-phase tools allow us to provide insight into these questions with in situ, in vacuo labeling reactions delivered through ion/ion chemistry. This Young Scientist Perspective demonstrates the robustness of these tools in describing native-like structure as well as possible deviations from native-like structure during native ion mobility/mass spectrometry. This Perspective illustrates some of the changes in structure produced by the removal of solvent and details some of the challenges and potential of the field.

AB A lack of suitable high-potential catholytes hinders the development of aqueous redox flow batteries (RFBs) for large-scale energy storage. Hydrolysis of the charged (oxidized) catholyte typically occurs when its redox potential approaches that of water, with a negative impact on battery performance. Here, we elucidate and address such behavior for a representative iron-based organometallic complex, showing that the associated voltage and capacity losses can be curtailed by several simple means. We discovered that addition of activated carbon cloth (ACC) to the reservoir of low-cost, high-potential [Fe(bpy)(3)](2+/3+) catholyte-limited aqueous redox flow batteries extends their lifetime and boosts discharge voltage & horbar;two typically orthogonal performance metrics. Similar effects are observed when the catholyte's graphite felt electrode is electrochemically oxidized (overcharged) and by modifying the catholyte solution's pH, which was monitored in situ for all flow batteries. Modulation of solution pH alters hydrolytic speciation of the charged catholyte from the typical dimeric species mu-O-[Fe-III(bpy)(2)(H2O)](2)(4+), converting it to a higher-potential mu-dihydroxo form, mu-[Fe-III(bpy)(2)(H2O)(OH)](2)(4+), at lower pH. The existence of free bpyH(2)(2+) at low pH is found to strongly correlate with battery degradation. Near-neutral-pH RFBs employing a viologen anolyte, (SPr)(2)V, in excess with the [Fe(bpy)(3)](2+/3+) catholyte containing ACC exhibited high-voltage discharge for up to 600 cycles (41 days) with no discernible capacity fade. Correlating pH and voltage data offers powerful fundamental insight into organometallic (electro)chemistry with potential utility beyond battery applications. The findings, with implications toward a host of other "near-neutral" active species, illuminate the critical and underappreciated role of electrolyte pH on intracycle and long-term aqueous flow battery performance.

AB Planetary boundary layer (PBL) schemes parameterize unresolved turbulent mixing within the PBL and free troposphere (FT). Previous studies reported that precipitation simulation over the Amazon in South America is quite sensitive to PBL schemes and the exact relationship between the turbulent mixing and precipitation processes is, however, not disentangled. In this study, regional climate simulations over the Amazon in January-February 2019 are examined at process level to understand the precipitation sensitivity to PBL scheme. The focus is on two PBL schemes, the Yonsei University (YSU) scheme, and the asymmetric convective model v2 (ACM2) scheme, which show the largest difference in the simulated precipitation. During daytime, while the FT clouds simulated by YSU dissipate, clouds simulated by ACM2 maintain because of enhanced moisture supply due to the enhanced vertical moisture relay transport process: (a) vertical mixing within PBL transports surface moisture to the PBL top, and (b) FT mixing feeds the moisture into the FT cloud deck. Due to the thick cloud deck over Amazon simulated by ACM2, surface radiative heating is reduced and consequently the convective available potential energy is reduced. As a result, precipitation is weaker from ACM2. Two key parameters dictating the vertical mixing are identified, p, an exponent determining boundary layer mixing and ?, a scale dictating FT mixing. Sensitivity simulations with altered p, ?, and other treatments within YSU and ACM2 confirm the precipitation sensitivity. The FT mixing in the presence of clouds appears most critical to explain the sensitivity between YSU and ACM2.

AB Two Co-II -based complexes, {[Co(dps)(2)(N-3)(2) ] <middle dot>H2O}(n) ( 1 ) and [Co(dps)(2) (N-3)(2)]n ( 2 ), show a 1D chain and a 3D network, respectively. The central CoII ions in the complexes have the same coordination environment with the [Co(dps)(4)(N-3)(2) ] unit. Although the differences in crystal parameters are nearly negligible, their magnetic properties are very different. AC susceptibility data show that 1 behaves as a typical field-induced single-ion magnet (SIM) with the out-of-phase (chi(M)") signals, while 2 shows ac signals of chi(M)" without peaks even under applied dc filed within our measurement window. Far-IR magneto-spectra (FIRMS) show strong spin-phonon couplings at 0 T in 2 , likely making the magnetic relaxation in 2 fast, while the couplings are negligible in 1. Small spin-phonon coupling in 1 likely leads to slower magnetic relaxation, making 1 a SIM. The difference in the properties is due to the structural rigidity of 2 in its 3D network, leading to stronger spin-phonon coupling. Combined high-field EPR (HF-EPR) and FIRMS studies give spin-Hamiltonian parameters, including D = 64.0(9) cm(-1) , | E | = 15.7(2) cm(-1) for 1 and D = 80.0(2) cm(-1) , | E | = 19.0(1) cm-1 for 2 .

AB The pressure-recovery (P-Y) diagram used in reverse osmosis (RO) literature to compare energy consumptions in different RO configurations has a flaw of not holding the design flux constant. In this work, the P-Y diagrams are constructed with the aid of transport models. It is shown that the area underneath the P-Y curve represents the specific energy consumption (SEC) imposed by design flux and thermodynamics, which may be reduced by improving spatial uniformity in flux. The trend generally observes the equipartition of entropy production theorem. For seawater RO (SWRO) in which pressure drop relative to feed osmotic pressure is small and operation is near the thermodynamic limit, staged designs with interstage booster pumps enable a more uniform flux, thus reducing the SEC. However, for low-salinity brackish water RO (BWRO), improving flux uniformity may lead to a higher SEC as the increased friction loss often outweighs the reduced energy requirement imposed by system flux.

AB Our understanding of early-type galaxies (ETGs) has grown in the past decade with the advance of full-spectrum fitting techniques used to infer the properties of the stellar populations that make up the galaxy. We present ages, central velocity dispersions, and abundance ratios relative to Fe of C, N, O, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Sr, Ba, and Eu, derived using full-spectrum fitting techniques for three ETGs, NGC 2865, NGC 3818, and NGC 4915. Each of these three galaxies were selected because they have optical, disturbed structures (fine structure) that are linked to major merger events that occurred 1, 7, and 6 Gyr ago, respectively. Two of the ETGs, NGC 3818 and NGC 4915, show chemical signatures similar to ETGs without fine structure, which is consistent with a gas-poor merger of elliptical galaxies in which substantial star formation is not expected. For NGC 2865, we find a statistically higher abundance of Ca (an alpha element) and Cr and Mn (Fe-peak elements). We show that for NGC 2865, a simple gas-rich merger scenario fails to explain the larger abundance ratios compared to ETGs without fine structure. These three ETGs with fine structure exhibit a range of abundances, suggesting ETGs with fine structure can form via multiple pathways and types of galaxy mergers.

AB During the HIV-1 assembly process, the Gag polyprotein multimerizes at the producer cell plasma membrane, resulting in the formation of spherical immature virus particles. Gag-genomic RNA (gRNA) interactions play a crucial role in the multimerization process, which is yet to be fully understood. We performed large-scale all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of membrane-bound full-length Gag dimer, hexamer, and 18-mer. The inter-domain dynamic correlation of Gag, quantified by the heterogeneous elastic network model applied to the simulated trajectories, is observed to be altered by implicit gRNA binding, as well as the multimerization state of the Gag. The lateral dynamics of our simulated membrane-bound Gag proteins, with and without gRNA binding, agree with prior experimental data and help to validate our simulation models and methods. The gRNA binding is observed to affect mainly the SP1 domain of the 18-mer and the matrix-capsid linker domain of the hexamer. In the absence of gRNA binding, the independent dynamical motion of the nucleocapsid domain results in a collapsed state of the dimeric Gag. Unlike stable SP1 helices in the six-helix bundle, without IP6 binding, the SP1 domain undergoes a spontaneous helix-to-coil transition in the dimeric Gag. Together, our findings reveal conformational switches of Gag at different stages of the multimerization process and predict that the gRNA binding reinforces an efficient binding surface of Gag for multimerization, and also regulates the dynamic organization of the local membrane region itself.

TI Proton removal from 73,75Br to 72,74Se at intermediate energies
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW C

DT Article
ID NUCLEAR-DATA SHEETS; SHAPE COEXISTENCE; SPECTROSCOPY; TRANSITION; STATES
AB We report experimental data for excited states of 72,74Se obtained from proton removal from 73,75Br secondary beams on a proton target. The experiments were performed with the Ursinus-NSCL liquid hydrogen target and the combined GRETINA+S800 setup at the Coupled Cyclotron Facility of the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at Michigan State University. Within uncertainties, the inclusive cross sections for proton removal from 73,75Br on a proton target are identical suggesting that the same single -particle orbitals contribute to the proton -removal reaction. In addition, details of the partial cross section fragmentation are discussed. The data might suggest that l = 1, 2, 3, and 4 angular momentum transfers are important to understand the population of excited states of 72,74Se in proton removal. Available data for excited states of 74Ge populated through the 75As(d, 3He)74Ge proton -removal reaction in normal kinematics suggest indeed that the fp and sd shell as well as the 1g9/2 orbital contribute. A comparison to data available for odd -A nuclei supports that the bulk of the spectroscopic strengths could be found at lower energies in the even -even Se isotopes than in, for instance, the even -even Ge isotopes. In addition, the population of high -J states seems to indicate that multistep processes contribute to proton -removal reactions at intermediate energies in these collective nuclei.

TI Numerical investigation of quasistatic magnetoconvection with an imposed

ID RAYLEIGH-BENARD CONVECTION; LIQUID-METAL LAYERS; HEAT-TRANSFER;
   TURBULENCE
AB Quasistatic Rayleigh-Benard convection with an imposed horizontal magnetic field is investigated numerically for Chandrasekhar numbers up to Q = 10(6) with stress-free boundary conditions. Both Q and the Rayleigh number (Ra) are varied to identify the various dynamical regimes that are present in this system. We find three primary regimes: (i) a two-dimensional (2D) regime in which the axes of the convection rolls are oriented parallel to the imposed magnetic field; (ii) an anisotropic three-dimensional (3D) regime; and (iii) a mean flow regime characterized by a large scale horizontal flow directed transverse to the imposed magnetic field. The transition to 3D dynamics is preceded by a series of 2D transitions in which the number of convection rolls decreases as Ra is increased. For sufficiently large Q, there is an eventual transition to two rolls just prior to the 2D-3D transition. The 2D-3D transition occurs when inertial forces become comparable to the Lorentz force, i.e., when .root Q/Re = O(1); 2D, magnetically constrained states persist when .root Q/Re greater than or similar to O(1). Within the 2D regime, we find heat and momentum transport scalings that are consistent with the hydrodynamic asymptotic predictions of Chini and Cox [Phys. Fluids 21, 083603 (2009)]: the Nusselt number (Nu) and Reynolds number (Re) scale as Nu - Ra-1/3 and Re - Ra-2/3, respectively. For Q = 10(6), we find that the scaling behavior of Nu and Re breaks down at large values of Ra due to a sequence of bifurcations and the eventual manifestation of mean flows.

AB Sequencing of human genome samples has unearthed genetic variants for which functional testing is necessary to validate their clinical significance. We used the Drosophila system to analyze a variant of unknown significance in the human congenital heart disease gene NKX2.5 (also known as NKX2-5). We generated an R321N allele of the NKX2.5 ortholog tinman (tin) to model a human K158N variant and tested its function in vitro and in vivo. The R321N Tin isoform bound poorly to DNA in vitro and was deficient in activating a Tin-dependent enhancer in tissue culture. Mutant Tin also showed a significantly reduced interaction with a Drosophila T-box cardiac factor named Dorsocross1. We generated a tinR321N allele using CRISPR/Cas9, for which homozygotes were viable and had normal heart specification, but showed defects in the differentiation of the adult heart that were exacerbated by further loss of tin function. We propose that the human K158N variant is pathogenic through causing a deficiency in DNA binding and a reduced ability to interact with a cardiac co-factor, and that cardiac defects might arise later in development or adult life.

ID ONTOLOGY; SEQUENCE
AB Motivation: Accurate protein function prediction is crucial for understanding biological processes and advancing biomedical research. However, the rapid growth of protein sequences far outpaces the experimental characterization of their functions, necessitating the development of automated computational methods. Results: We present InterLabelGO+, a hybrid approach that integrates a deep learning-based method with an alignment-based method for improved protein function prediction. InterLabelGO+ incorporates a novel loss function that addresses label dependency and imbalance and further enhances performance through dynamic weighting of the alignment-based component. A preliminary version of InterLabelGO+ achieved a strong performance in the CAFA5 challenge, ranking sixth out of 1625 participating teams. Comprehensive evaluations on large-scale protein function prediction tasks demonstrate InterLabelGO+'s ability to accurately predict Gene Ontology terms across various functional categories and evaluation metrics.

AB Commercial titanium dioxide is successfully plasma-treated under ambient conditions for different periods, leading to reduced crystallite size and the creation of oxygen vacancies. Density functional theory-based calculations reveal the emergence of additional localized states close to the conduction band, primarily associated with under-coordinated titanium atoms in non-stoichiometric titanium-oxide systems. The plasma-treated samples exhibit improved photocatalytic performance in the degradation of methylene blue compared to untreated samples. Moreover, the 4-hour plasma-treated photocatalyst demonstrates commendable stability and reusability. This work highlights the potential of cost-effective plasma treatment as a simple modification technique to significantly enhance the photocatalytic capabilities of titanium-oxide materials.
   Air-plasma treatment induces oxygen vacancies in the titanium dioxide matrix. This leads to the creation of shallow trap states in the band gap that delays or hinders electron-hole recombination, hence improving photocatalysis. image

AB Arctic sea-ice extent has reduced by over 40% during late summer since 1979, and the day-to-day changes in sea ice extent have shifted to more negative values. Drivers of Arctic weather that cause large short-term changes are rarely predicted more than a week in advance. Here we investigate variability in changes in sea ice extent for periods of less than 18 days and their association to Arctic cyclones and tropopause polar vortices. We find that these very rapid sea ice loss events are substantial year-round and have increased over the last 30 years in June-August due to thinning sea ice that is more susceptible to forcings from ocean waves and low-level atmospheric wind. These events occur in regions of enhanced near-surface level pressure gradients between synoptic-scale high and low pressure systems over regions of relatively thin sea ice, and are preceded by tropopause polar vortices.

AB As the year-to-year gains in speeds of classical computers continue to taper off, computational chemists are increasingly examining quantum computing as a possible route to achieve greater computational performance. Quantum computers, built upon the properties of superposition, interference, and entanglement of quantum bits, offer, in principle, the possibility to outperform classical computers for solving many important classes of problems. In the field of chemistry, quantum algorithm development offers promising propositions for solving classically intractable problems in areas such as electronic structure, chemical quantum dynamics, spectroscopy, and cheminformatics. However, physical implementations of quantum computers are still in their infancy and have yet to outperform classical computers for useful computations. Still, quantum software development for chemistry is a highly active area of research. In this perspective, we summarize recent progress in the areas of quantum computing algorithms, hardware, and software, and we describe the challenges that remain for useful implementations of quantum computing for chemical applications.

AB We have developed a United framework that integrates three self-supervised learning (SSL) ingredients (discriminative, restorative, and adversarial learning), enabling collaborative learning among the three learning ingredients and yielding three transferable components: a discriminative encoder, a restorative decoder, and an adversary encoder. To leverage this collaboration, we redesigned nine prominent self-supervised methods, including Rotation, Jigsaw, Rubik's Cube, Deep Clustering, TransVW, MoCo, BYOL, PCRL, and Swin UNETR, and augmented each with its missing components in a United framework for 3D medical imaging. However, such a United framework increases model complexity, making 3D pretraining difficult. To overcome this difficulty, we propose stepwise incremental pretraining, a strategy that unifies the pretraining, in which a discriminative encoder is first trained via discriminative learning, the pretrained discriminative encoder is then attached to a restorative decoder, forming a skip-connected encoder-decoder, for further joint discriminative and restorative learning. Last, the pretrained encoder-decoder is associated with an adversarial encoder for final full discriminative, restorative, and adversarial learning. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the stepwise incremental pretraining stabilizes United models pretraining, resulting in significant performance gains and annotation cost reduction via transfer learning in six target tasks, ranging from classification to segmentation, across diseases, organs, datasets, and modalities. This performance improvement is attributed to the synergy of the three SSL ingredients in our United framework unleashed through stepwise incremental pretraining. Our codes and pretrained models are available at GitHub.com/JLiangLab/StepwisePretraining.

AB Multidimensional power devices can achieve performance beyond conventional limits by deploying charge-balanced p-n junctions. A key obstacle to developing such devices in many wide-bandgap (WBG) and ultra-wide bandgap (UWBG) semiconductors is the difficulty of native p-type doping. Here the WBG nickel oxide (NiO) as an alternative p-type material is investigated. The acceptor concentration (N-A) in NiO is modulated by oxygen partial pressure during magnetron sputtering and characterized using a p-n(+) heterojunction diode fabricated on gallium oxide (Ga2O3) substrate. Capacitance and breakdown measurements reveal a tunable N-A from < 10(18) cm(-3) to 2x10(18) cm(-3) with the practical breakdown field (E-B) of 3.8 to 6.3 MV cm(-1). This N-A range allows for charge balance to n-type region with reasonable process latitude, and E-B is high enough to pair with many WBG and UWBG semiconductors. The extracted N-A is then used to design a multidimensional Ga2O3 diode with NiO field-modulation structure. The diodes fabricated with two different N-A both achieve 8000 V breakdown voltage and 4.7 MV cm(-1) average electric field. This field is over three times higher than the best report in prior multi-kilovolt lateral devices. These results show the promise of p-type NiO for pushing the performance limits of power devices.

AB Developing sustainable urban systems is a fundamental societal challenge for the 21st century, and central Texas faces particularly synergistic challenges of a rapidly growing urban population and a projected increasingly drought-prone climate. To assess the history of urbanization impacts on watersheds here, we analyzed 51 cores from bald cypress trees in paired urban and rural watersheds in Austin, Texas. We find a significant contrast between rural and urbanized watersheds. In the rural watershed, tree-ring-width growth histories ("chronologies") from 1844-2018 significantly and positively correlate (p < 0.01) with (1) one another, and (2) regional instrumental and proxy records of drought. In the urbanized watershed, by contrast, chronologies weakly correlate with one another, with instrumental records of drought, and with the rural chronologies and regional records. Relatively weak drought limitations to urban tree growth are consistent with the significant present-day transfer of municipal water from urban infrastructure by leakage and irrigation to the natural hydrologic system. We infer a significant, long-term contribution from infrastructure to baseflow in urbanized watersheds. In contrast to the common negative impacts of 'urban stream syndrome', such sustained baseflow in watersheds with impaired or failing infrastructure may be an unintended positive consequence for stream ecosystems, as a mitigation against projected extended 21st-century droughts. Additionally, riparian trees may serve as a proxy for past impacts of urbanization on natural streams, which may inform sustainable urban development.

AB Producing green hydrogen via water electrolysis using renewable energy sources holds promise for a sustainable future. However, current challenges arise from the energy-intensive oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the potential risks associated with the mixing of H-2 and O-2. To address these challenges, there has been significant emphasis on replacing the OER with more thermodynamically favorable aldehyde oxidation for the production of carboxylic acids. In this work, we combined a novel two-dimensional (2D) early transition metal carbide (MXene) supported cobalt catalyst (Co/Mo2TiC2-700) for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and a NiFe/Ni foam fabricated by an electrodeposition method for the furfural oxidation reaction (FOR) to design a paired flow electrolyzer. In H-type half-cell tests, the NiFe/Ni foam anode catalyst exhibited a faradaic efficiency (FE) of 47% towards 2-furoic acid (2-FA) and a conversion of 95% with 50 mM furfural at 65 mA cm(-2). This FE rose to 97% at a conversion of 67% when the furfural concentration was increased to 150 mM. The optimized Co/Mo2TiC2-700 cathode catalyst exhibited outstanding HER performances of 100% FE towards H-2, and low overpotentials of 244 mV and 321 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) and 400 mA cm(-2), respectively. A two-electrode flow cell with 2 x 2 cm(2) electrodes was then assembled for simultaneous electrochemical furfural oxidation and hydrogen evolution. Remarkably, Co/Mo2TiC2-700 outperformed a commercial Pt/C electrode with the same loading of 0.5 mg-metal per cm(2) by reducing the cell voltage by 150 mV at a high current density of 300 mA cm(-2), while maintaining the FE-to-H-2 conversion at >90%. The overall FE increased from 120% to 151% at a high current density of 200 mA cm(-2), and the cell voltage dropped to 2.688 V for the electrolyzer with the Co/Mo2TiC2-700 catalyst, compared to 3.185 V when using Pt/C at the cathode.

AB Evidence of chirality was observed at the Fe metal center in Fe(III) spin crossover coordination salts [Fe(qsal)2][Ni(dmit)2] and [Fe(qsal)2](TCNQ)2 from x-ray absorption (XAS) spectroscopy at the Fe 2p3/2 core threshold. Based on the circularly polarized XAS data, the x-ray natural circular dichroism for [Fe(qsal)2][Ni(dmit)2] and [Fe(qsal)2](TCNQ)2 is far stronger than seen for [Fe(qsal)2]Cl suggesting this natural circular dichroism signature is a ligand effect rather than a result of just a loss of octahedral symmetry on the Fe core. The larger the chiral effects in the Fe 2p core to bound XAS, the greater the perturbation of the Fe 2p3/2 to 2p1/2 spin-orbit splitting seen in the XAS spectra.

AB Diaryl thieno-[3,4-b]thiophenes (TT) are photoswitchable compounds that operate through reversible photoinduced cyclization/cycloreversion and have been designed specifically for integration within pi-conjugated polymers to switchably manipulate polymer electronic properties. Here we report on how cross conjugating the central TT moiety impacts photocyclization dynamics as interrogated using transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) for a series of switches built with electron-rich substituents that have various electronic interaction strengths with the TT core. For cross-conjugated structures exhibiting a propensity to switch in steady-state photoconversion experiments, ultrafast TAS reveals signatures of rapid dynamics (occurring within <1-10 ps) similar to those observed for unsubstituted switches and that are consistent with photocyclization. In contrast, TAS reveals comparatively slower spectral dynamics (similar to 100 ps) that are not consistent with cyclization for switches that are cross-conjugated with substituents that have greater electronic interaction with the TT core and that exhibit no propensity to photoswitch in photoconversion experiments. Microsecond TAS confirms that photoinduced cyclization occurs for the former and that a metastable triplet state localized on the conjugated backbone is generated with the latter. We find that the balance of these two deactivation pathways is sensitive to the interaction strength of the conjugated substituents with the core, with select structures exhibiting signatures of both. These findings are consistent with prior work demonstrating that the LUMO character is delocalized over the switch backbone when there are strong interactions with cross-conjugating groups and reveal that the competition between deactivation pathways can be controlled structurally by weakening pi conjugation across the backbone.

AB Global food systems must be a part of strategies for greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation, optimal water use, and nitrogen pollution reduction. Insights from research in these areas can inform policies to build sustainable food systems yet limited work has been done to build understanding around whether or not sustainability efforts compete with supply chain resilience. This study explores the interplay between food supply resilience and environmental impacts in US cities, within the context of global food systems' contributions to GHG emissions, water use, and nitrogen pollution. Utilizing county-level agricultural data, we assess the water use, GHG emissions, and nitrogen losses of urban food systems across the US, and juxtapose these against food supply resilience, represented by supply chain diversity. Our results highlight that supply chain resilience and sustainability can simultaneously exist and are not necessarily in competition with each other. We also found a significant per capita footprint in the environmental domains across Southern cities, specifically those along the Gulf Coast and southern Great Plains. Food supply chain resilience scores ranged from 0.18 to 0.69, with lower scores in the southwest and Great Plains, while northeastern and Midwestern regions demonstrated higher resilience. We found several cities with high supply chain resilience and moderate or low environmental impacts as well as areas with high impacts and low resilience. This study provides insights into potential trade-offs and opportunities for creating sustainable urban food systems in the US, underscoring the need for strategies that consider both resilience and environmental implications.

AB The intercalated disk is a cardiac specific structure composed of three main protein complexes-adherens junctions, desmosomes, and gap junctions-that work in concert to provide mechanical stability and electrical synchronization to the heart. Each substructure is regulated through a variety of mechanisms including proteolysis. Calpain proteases, a class of cysteine proteases dependent on calcium for activation, have recently emerged as important regulators of individual intercalated disk components. In this review, we will examine how calcium homeostasis regulates normal calpain function. We will also explore how calpains modulate gap junctions, desmosomes, and adherens junctions activity by targeting specific proteins, and describe the molecular mechanisms of how calpain dysregulation leads to structural and signaling defects within the heart. We will then examine how changes in calpain activity affects cardiomyocytes, and how such changes underlie various heart diseases.

AB Self-sorting is commonly observed in complex reaction systems, which has been utilized to guide the formation of single major by-design molecules. However, most studies have been focused on non-covalent systems, and using self-sorting to achieve covalently bonded architectures is still relatively less explored. Herein, we first demonstrated the dynamic nature of spiroborate linkage and systematically studied the self-sorting behavior observed in the transformation between spiroborate-linked well-defined polymeric and molecular architectures, which is enabled by spiroborate bond exchange. The scrambling between a macrocycle and a 1D helical covalent polymer led to the formation of a molecular cage, whose structures are all unambiguously elucidated by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The results indicate that the molecular cage is the thermodynamically favored product in this multi-component reaction system. This work represents the first example of a 1D polymeric architecture transforming into a shape-persistent molecular cage, driven by dynamic covalent self-sorting. This study will further guide the design of spiroborate-based materials and open the possibilities for the development of novel complex yet responsive dynamic covalent molecular or polymeric systems.

AB Photogrammetry is an emerging tool that allows scientists to measure important habitat characteristics of coral reefs at multiple spatial scales. However, the ecological benefits of using photogrammetry to measure reef habitat have rarely been assessed through direct comparison to traditional methods, especially in settings where manual measurements are more feasible and affordable. Here, we applied multiple methods to measure coral colonies (Pocillopora spp.) and asked whether photogrammetric or manual observations better describe short-term colony growth and links between colony size and the biodiversity of coral-dwelling fishes and invertebrates. Using photogrammetry, we measured patterns in changes in coral volume that were otherwise obscured by high variation from manual measurements. Additionally, we found that photogrammetry-based estimates of colony skeletal volume best predicted the abundance and richness of animals living within the coral. This study highlights that photogrammetry can improve descriptions of coral colony size, growth, and associated biodiversity compared to manual measurements.

ID RESIDENTIAL SEGREGATION; UNITED-STATES; CITIES
AB The three decades from 1940 through 1970 mark a turn ing point in the spa tial scale of Black-White res i den tial seg re ga tion in the United States com pared with earlier years. We decompose metropolitan segregation into three components: seg re ga tion within the city, within the sub urbs, and between the city and its sub urbs. We then show that extreme levels of seg re ga tion were well established in most cit ies by 1940, and they changed only mod estly by 1970. In this period, changes in seg re ga tion were greater at the met ro pol i tan scale, driven by racially selec tive pop u la tion growth in the sub urbs. We also exam ine major sources of ris ing seg re ga tion, includ ing region, met ro pol i tan total, and Black pop u la tion sizes, and indi ca tors of redlining in the cen tral cit ies based on risk maps pre pared by the Home Owners Loan Corporation (HOLC) in the late 1930s. In addi tion to over all regional dif fer ences, seg re ga tion between the city and sub urbs and within sub ur bia increased more in met ro pol i tan areas with larger Black pop u la tions, but this rela tion ship was found only in the North. In con trast to some recent the o riz ing, there is no asso ci a tion between prep a ra tion of an HOLC risk map or the share of city neigh bor hoods that were redlined and sub se quent change in any component of segregation.

TI The Capacity Region of Information Theoretic Secure Aggregation With

AB This paper considers the secure aggregation problem for federated learning under an information theoretic cryptographic formulation, where distributed training nodes (referred to as users) train models based on their own local data and a curious-but-honest server aggregates the trained models without retrieving other information about users' local data. Secure aggregation generally contains two phases, namely key sharing phase and model aggregation phase. Due to the common effect of user dropouts in federated learning, the model aggregation phase should contain two rounds, where in the first round the users transmit masked models and, in the second round, according to the identity of surviving users after the first round, these surviving users transmit some further messages to help the server decrypt the sum of users' trained models. The objective of the considered information theoretic formulation is to characterize the capacity region of the communication rates from the users to the server in the two rounds of the model aggregation phase, assuming that key sharing has already been performed offline in prior. In this context, Zhao and Sun completely characterized the capacity region under the assumption that the keys can be arbitrary random variables. More recently, an additional constraint, known as "uncoded groupwise keys," has been introduced. This constraint entails the presence of multiple independent keys within the system, with each key being shared by precisely S users, where S is a defined system parameter. The capacity region for the information theoretic secure aggregation problem with uncoded groupwise keys was established in our recent work subject to the condition S>K-U , where K is the number of total users and U is the designed minimum number of surviving users (which is another system parameter). In this paper we fully characterize the capacity region for this problem by matching a new converse bound and an achievable scheme. Experimental results over the Tencent Cloud show the improvement on the model aggregation time compared to the original secure aggregation scheme.

AB Emerging intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) significantly improve system performance, while also pose a huge risk for physical layer security. A disco IRS (DIRS), i.e., an illegitimate IRS with random time-varying reflection properties, can be employed by an attacker to actively age the channels of legitimate users (LUs). Such active channel aging (ACA) generated by the DIRS-based fully-passive jammer (FPJ) can be applied to jam multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) systems without relying on either jamming power or LU channel state information (CSI). To address the significant threats posed by the DIRS-based FPJ, an anti-jamming strategy is proposed that requires only the statistical characteristics of DIRS-jammed channels instead of their CSI. Statistical characteristics of DIRS-jammed channels are first derived, and then the anti-jamming precoder is given based on the derived statistical characteristics. Numerical results are also presented to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed anti-jamming precoder against the DIRS-based FPJ.

AB In order to quantify pelagic-benthic coupling on high-latitude shelves, it is imperative to identify the different physical mechanisms by which phytoplankton are exported to the sediments. In June-July 2023, a field program documented the evolution of an under-ice phytoplankton bloom on the northeast Chukchi shelf. Here, we use in situ data from the cruise, a simple numerical model, historical water column data, and ocean reanalysis fields to characterize the physical setting and describe the dynamically driven vertical export of chlorophyll associated with the bloom. A water mass front separating cold, high-nutrient winter water in the north and warmer summer waters to the south-roughly coincident with the ice edge-supported a baroclinic jet which is part of the Central Channel flow branch that veers eastward toward Barrow Canyon. A plume of high chlorophyll fluorescence extending from the near-surface bloom in the winter water downwards along the front was measured throughout the cruise. Using a passive tracer to represent phytoplankton in the model, it was demonstrated that the plume is the result of subduction due to baroclinic instability of the frontal jet. This process, in concert with the gravitational sinking, pumps the chlorophyll downwards an order of magnitude faster than gravitational sinking alone. Particle tracking using the ocean reanalysis fields reveals that a substantial portion of the chlorophyll away from the front is advected off of the northeast Chukchi shelf before reaching the bottom. This highlights the importance of the frontal subduction process for delivering carbon to the sea floor.

AB In Eastern boundary upwelling systems, such as the California Current System (CCS), seasonal upwelling brings low oxygen and low pH waters to the continental shelf, causing ocean acidification and hypoxia (OAH). The location, frequency, and intensity of OAH events is influenced by a combination of large-scale climatic trends, seasonal changes, small-scale circulation, and local human activities. Here, we use results from two 20-year long submesoscale-resolving simulations of the Northern and Southern U.S. West Coast (USWC) for the 1997-2017 period, to describe the characteristics and drivers of OAH events. These simulations reveal the emergence of hotspots in which seasonal declines in oxygen and pH are accompanied by localized short-term extremes in OAH. While OAH hotspots show substantial seasonal variability, significant intra-seasonal fluctuations occur, reflecting the interaction between low- and high-frequency forcings that shape OAH events. The mechanisms behind the seasonal decreases in pH and oxygen vary along the USWC. While remineralization remains the dominant force causing these declines throughout the coast, physical transport partially offsets these effects in Southern and Central California, but contributes to seasonal oxygen loss and acidification on the Northern Coast. Critically, the seasonal decline is not sufficient to predict the occurrence and duration of OAH extremes. Locally enhanced biogeochemical rates, including shallow benthic remineralization and rapid wind-driven transport, shape the spatial and temporal patterns of coastal OAH.

AB The confluence of recent discoveries of the roles of biomolecular liquids in living systems and modern abilities to precisely synthesize and modify nucleic acids (NAs) has led to a surge of interest in liquid phases of NAs. These phases can be formed primarily from NAs, as driven by base-pairing interactions, or from the electrostatic combination (coacervation) of negatively charged NAs and positively charged molecules. Generally, the use of sequence-engineered NAs provides the means to tune microsopic particle properties, and thus imbue specific, customizable behaviors into the resulting liquids. In this way, researchers have used NA liquids to tackle fundamental problems in the physics of finite valence soft materials, and to create liquids with novel structured and/or multi-functional properties. Here, we review this growing field, discussing the theoretical background of NA liquid phase separation, quantitative understanding of liquid material properties, and the broad and growing array of functional demonstrations in these materials. We close with a few comments discussing remaining open questions and challenges in the field.

AB Five structures of Ge2H2 and Ge2H2+ are investigated in this study. Optimized geometries at the CCSD(T)/cc-pwCVQZ-PP level of theory were obtained. Focal point analyses were performed on these optimized geometries to determine relative energies using the CCSD(T) method with polarized basis sets up to quintuple-zeta. Energy corrections include full T and pertubative (Q) coupled-cluster effects plus anharmonic corrections to the zero-point vibrational energy. Relative ordering in energy from lowest to highest of the five Ge2H2+ structures is butterfly, germylidene, monobridged, trans, then linear. In neutral Ge2H2, the monobridged structure lies lower in energy than the germylidene structure. Fundamental vibrational frequencies and IR intensities were computed for the minima at the CCSD(T)/cc-pwCVTZ-PP level of theory to compare with experimental research. Partial atomic charges and natural bonding orbital analyses indicated that the positive charge of Ge2H2+ is contained in the region of the Ge-Ge bond.

ID RANDOM SUBSPACE METHOD; STATISTICAL-MECHANICS
AB Feature bagging is a well-established ensembling method which aims to reduce prediction variance by combining predictions of many estimators trained on subsets or projections of features. Here, we develop a theory of feature-bagging in noisy least-squares ridge ensembles and simplify the resulting learning curves in the special case of equicorrelated data. Using analytical learning curves, we demonstrate that subsampling shifts the double-descent peak of a linear predictor. This leads us to introduce heterogeneous feature ensembling, with estimators built on varying numbers of feature dimensions, as a computationally efficient method to mitigate double-descent. Then, we compare the performance of a feature-subsampling ensemble to a single linear predictor, describing a trade-off between noise amplification due to subsampling and noise reduction due to ensembling. Our qualitative insights carry over to linear classifiers applied to image classification tasks with realistic datasets constructed using a state-of-the-art deep learning feature map.

AB The excess of passivity (EoP) of the human biomechanics plays an imperative role in absorbing the interaction energy during physical human-(tele)robot interaction and can be exploited by controllers used for stabilization of human-centered (tele)robotic systems. However, the first generation of nonlinear EoP-based stabilizers loaded the force reflection channel resulting in degradation of the force profile. This will challenge applications that are heavily dependent on the quality of force reflection, such as telerobotic rehabilitation. This article explores the possibility of developing a nonlinear stabilizer that modifies the reflected velocity to the follower-side operator based on the corresponding EoP map. As an applied benefit in the context of telerehabilitation, the proposed stabilizer does not require information about the EoP of all patients; instead, it would require that for the individual therapist who works with the group of patients. The article provides the mathematical derivation and stability proof of the nonlinear design of the stabilizer named "power-based velocity-domain variable structure passivity signature control (PV-VSPSC)." The proposed nonlinear stabilizer is evaluated through systematic experiments and systematic grid simulation studies in this paper.

AB Among the many natural biomaterials for which information on atomic-level structure and reorientational motion can offer essential clues to function, insoluble multi-component composites with limited degrees of order are among the most challenging to study. Despite its limited sensitivity, solid-state NMR (ssNMR) is often the technique of choice to ferret out these details in carbon- and nitrogen-rich materials: this spectroscopic approach can probe many biomaterials in their native or near-native states, either with or without the introduction of stable NMR-active isotopes, or with the assistance of dynamic nuclear polarization technology. During a span of close to four decades, such research targets and ssNMR approaches have been exemplified by insects, a diverse and evolutionarily agile group of organisms with global impacts that include ecology, agriculture, and human disease. In this short review, we present case studies on insect cuticles that range from protective exoskeletons and egg capsules to the wing structures that enable flight and showcase nature's awe-inspiring beauty, highlighting the use of ssNMR spectroscopy to profile chemical composition, elucidate macromolecular architecture, and monitor metabolic development in these fascinating biological assemblies.

SO CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS

AB Polyborosiloxanes are used in a variety of fields due to their unique dynamic properties. Traditionally, cross-linked polyborosiloxanes are prepared by incorporating boric acid into siloxane prepolymers, a process that is time-consuming, energy intensive, and challenging due to reagent immiscibility. Here, we report a versatile synthetic method to rapidly cure polyborosiloxane networks via hydrosilylation of chain end or backbone functionalized polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) derivatives with an inexpensive trivinylboronate. Networks synthesized from these readily available building blocks cure in similar to 2 min at convenient temperatures (e.g., 90 degrees C) and exhibit enhanced viscoelastic behavior when compared to traditional polyborosiloxane networks fabricated via the conventional condensation route. By virtue of using efficient hydrosilylation chemistry, another key advantage of this synthetic platform is the ability to synthesize dynamic polyborosiloxanes with different network connectivity by simply using silicones with Si-H moieties placed at the chain ends (end-group) or distributed throughout the repeat-unit structure (pendant-group). The availability of other alkenes amenable to hydrosilylation provides an additional formulation handle to synthesize mixed dynamic-static networks with tunable control over stress relaxation and solvent resistance. In summary, the synthetic approach disclosed herein is a simple and accessible platform for preparing dynamic polyborosiloxanes with tunable material properties.

AB As populations and temperatures of urban areas swell, more people face extreme heat and are at increasing risk of adverse health outcomes. Radiation accounts for much of human heat exposure but is rarely used as heat metric due to a lack of cost-effective and accurate sensors. To this end, we fuse the concepts of a three-globe radiometer-anemometer with a cylindrical human body shape representation, which is more realistic than a spherical representation. Using cost-effective and readily available materials, we fabricated two combinations of three cylinders with varying surface properties. These simple devices measure the convection coefficient and the shortwave and longwave radiative fluxes. We tested the devices in a wind tunnel and at fourteen outdoor sites during July 2023's record-setting heat wave in Tempe, Arizona. The average difference between pedestrian-level mean radiant temperature (MRT) measured using research-grade 3-way net radiometers and the three-cylinder setup was 0.4 +/-\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\pm$$\end{document} 3.0 degrees C (+/-\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\pm$$\end{document} 1 SD). At most, we observed a 10 degrees C MRT difference on a white roof site with extreme MRT values (70 degrees C to 80 degrees C), which will be addressed through discussed design changes to the system. The measured heat transfer coefficient can be used to calculate wind speed below 2 m center dot s-1; thus, the three cylinders combined also serve as a low-speed anemometer. The novel setup could be used in affordable biometeorological stations and deployed across urban landscapes to build human-relevant heat sensing networks.

AB Graphene can support surface plasmons with higher confinement, lower propagation loss, and substantially more tunable response compared to usual metal-based plasmonic structures. Interestingly, plasmons in graphene can strongly couple with nanostructures and gratings placed in its vicinity to form new hybrid systems that can provide a platform to investigate more complicated plasmonic phenomena. In this Perspective, an analysis on the excitation of highly confined graphene plasmons and their strong coupling with metallic or dielectric gratings is performed. We emphasize the flexibility in the efficient control of light-matter interaction by these new hybrid systems, benefiting from the interplay between graphene plasmons and other external resonant modes. The hybrid graphene-plasmon grating systems offer unique tunable plasmonic resonances with enhanced field distributions. They exhibit a novel route to realize practical emerging applications, including nonreciprocal devices, plasmonic switches, perfect absorbers, nonlinear structures, photodetectors, and optical sensors.

   deviation; learning theory
AB Precise asymptotics have revealed many surprises in high-dimensional regression. These advances, however, have not extended to perhaps the simplest estimator: direct Nadaraya-Watson (NW) kernel smoothing. Here, we describe how one can use ideas from the analysis of the random energy model (REM) in statistical physics to compute sharp asymptotics for the NW estimator when the sample size is exponential in the dimension. As a simple starting point for investigation, we focus on the case in which one aims to estimate a single-index target function using a radial basis function kernel on the sphere. Our main result is a pointwise asymptotic for the NW predictor, showing that it re-scales the argument of the true link function. Our work provides a first step towards a detailed understanding of kernel smoothing in high dimensions.

   NMR
AB Disordered rocksalt oxide (DRX) cathodes are promising candidates for next-generation Co- and Ni-free Li-ion batteries. While fluorine substitution for oxygen has been explored as an avenue to enhance their performance, the amount of fluorine incorporated into the DRX structure is particularly challenging to quantify and impedes our ability to relate fluorination to electrochemical performance. Herein, an experimental-computational method combining Li-7 and F-19 solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, and ab initio cluster expansion Monte Carlo simulations, is developed to determine the composition of DRX oxyfluorides. Using this method, the synthesis of Mn- and Ti-containing DRX via standard high temperature sintering and microwave heating is optimized. Further, the upper fluorination limit attainable using each of these two synthesis routes is established for various Mn-rich DRX compounds. A comparison of their electrochemical performance reveals that the capacity and capacity retention mostly depend on the Mn content, while fluorination plays a secondary role.

AB We have sequenced, assembled, and analyzed the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes and transcriptomes of Potamopyrgus estuarinus and Potamopyrgus kaitunuparaoa, two prosobranch snail species native to New Zealand that together span the continuum from estuary to freshwater. These two species are the closest known relatives of the freshwater species Potamopyrgus antipodarum-a model for studying the evolution of sex, host-parasite coevolution, and biological invasiveness-and thus provide key evolutionary context for understanding its unusual biology. The P. estuarinus and P. kaitunuparaoa genomes are very similar in size and overall gene content. Comparative analyses of genome content indicate that these two species harbor a near-identical set of genes involved in meiosis and sperm functions, including seven genes with meiosis-specific functions. These results are consistent with obligate sexual reproduction in these two species and provide a framework for future analyses of P. antipodarum-a species comprising both obligately sexual and obligately asexual lineages, each separately derived from a sexual ancestor. Genome-wide multigene phylogenetic analyses indicate that P. kaitunuparaoa is likely the closest relative to P. antipodarum. We nevertheless show that there has been considerable introgression between P. estuarinus and P. kaitunuparaoa. That introgression does not extend to the mitochondrial genome, which appears to serve as a barrier to hybridization between P. estuarinus and P. kaitunuparaoa. Nuclear-encoded genes whose products function in joint mitochondrial-nuclear enzyme complexes exhibit similar patterns of nonintrogression, indicating that incompatibilities between the mitochondrial and the nuclear genome may have prevented more extensive gene flow between these two species.

AB The increasing need for sharing workspace and interactive physical tasks between robots and humans has raised concerns regarding the safety of such operations. In this regard, controllable clutches have shown great potential for addressing important safety concerns at the hardware level by separating the high-impedance actuator from the end-effector by providing the power transfer from electromagnetic source to the human. However, the existing clutches suffer from high power consumption and large weight, which make them undesirable from the design point of view. In this article, for the first time, the design and development of a novel, lightweight, and low-power torque-adjustable rotary clutch using electroadhesive materials are presented. The performance of three different pairs of clutch plates is investigated in the context of the smoothness and quality of output torque. The performance degradation issue due to the polarization of the insulator is addressed through the utilization of an alternating current waveform activation signal. Moreover, the effect of the activation frequency on the output torque and power consumption of the clutch is investigated. Finally, a time-dependent model for the output torque of the clutch is presented, and the performance of the clutch was evaluated through experiments, including physical human-robot interaction. The proposed clutch offers a torque-to-power consumption ratio that is six times better than commercial magnetic particle clutches. The proposed clutch presents great potential for developing safe, lightweight, and low-power physical human-robot interaction systems, such as exoskeletons and robotic walkers.

TI Induction of Controllable Vortical Flow in a Dual-Stenosis Aorta Model:
   A Replication of Disordered Eddies Flow in Aneurysms

LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Vortical flow; Disturbed flow; Aneurysm; Wall shear stress;
   Computational hemodynamics
AB This paper presents a two-stenosis aorta model mimicking vortical flow in vascular aneurysms. More specifically, we propose to virtually induce two adjacent stenoses in the abdominal aorta to develop various vortical flow zones post stenoses. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were conducted for the virtual two-stenosis model based on physiological and anatomical data (i.e., diameters, flow rate waveforms) from adult rabbits. The virtual model includes adult rabbits' infra-renal portion of the aorta and iliac arteries. 3D CFD simulations in five different dual-stenosis configurations were performed using a commercial CFD package (FLUENT). In-house software assessed the evolution of flow vortices. Notably, spatial-temporally averaged wall shear stress (STA-WSS) and oscillatory shear index (OSI), the total volume of vortex flow, the number of vortices, and the phase-to-phase overlap of vortex flow within each region were evaluated. In all models, we found consistent patterns of the vortex flow parameters, indicating that the adjacent stenoses induced three different hemodynamic zones, namely, stable vortical flow (after the first stenosis), transient vortical flow (after the second stenosis), and unstable vortical flow (further distal to the second stenosis). Also, different degrees of flow disturbance can be achieved in these three zones. It is significant to note that, although the 'dual-stenosis' geometry is completely hypothetical, it allows us to create various vortical flows in consecutive vessel segments for the first time. As a result, if implemented as a pre-clinical model, the proposed two-stenosis model offers an attractive, tunable environment to investigate the interplays between subject-specific hemodynamics and vascular remodeling. This aspect remains in our future directions.

TI Enabling Selective Mechanochemical Scission of Network Crosslinks by

AB The tearing of a polymer network arises from mechanochemically coupled bond-breaking events in the backbone of a polymer chain. An emerging research area is the identification of molecular strategies for network toughening, such as the strategic placement of mechanochemically reactive groups (e.g., scissile mechanophores) in the crosslinks of a network instead of in the load-bearing primary strands. These mechanically labile crosslinkers have typically relied on release of ring strain or weak covalent bonds for selective covalent bond scission. Here, we report a novel chemical design for accelerated mechanochemical bond scission based on replacing a single carbon atom in a crosslinker with a silicon atom. This single-atom replacement affords up to a two-fold increase in the tearing energy. We suggest a mechanism, validated by computational modeling, for accelerated mechanochemical Si-C bond scission based on minimizing the energy required to distort the starting material toward the transition-state geometry. We demonstrated the seamless incorporation of these scissile carbosilanes to toughen 3D-printed networks, which demonstrates their suitability for additive manufacturing processes.

TI Q-RBSA: high-resolution 3D EBSD map generation using an efficient
   quaternion transformer network
SO NPJ COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS
LA English
DT Article
AB Gathering 3D material microstructural information is time-consuming, expensive, and energy-intensive. Acquisition of 3D data has been accelerated by developments in serial sectioning instrument capabilities; however, for crystallographic information, the electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) imaging modality remains rate limiting. We propose a physics-based efficient deep learning framework to reduce the time and cost of collecting 3D EBSD maps. Our framework uses a quaternion residual block self-attention network (QRBSA) to generate high-resolution 3D EBSD maps from sparsely sectioned EBSD maps. In QRBSA, quaternion-valued convolution effectively learns local relations in orientation space, while self-attention in the quaternion domain captures long-range correlations. We apply our framework to 3D data collected from commercially relevant titanium alloys, showing both qualitatively and quantitatively that our method can predict missing samples (EBSD information between sparsely sectioned mapping points) as compared to high-resolution ground truth 3D EBSD maps.

AB In this study, NiSe2 nanocubes, ZnO rods, and their composites were prepared by simple chemical methods to investigate their photocatalytic response and antibacterial activity. The optimal concentration of NiSe2 nanocubes was explored for enhanced photocatalytic performance by varying its percentage in the NiSe2-ZnO composites. The findings suggested that the optical response of ZnO was significantly improved and shifted towards visible region by incorporating NiSe2 as a co-catalyst. The photocatalytic properties of NiSe2, ZnO, and NiSe2-ZnO composites were assessed under visible light by using methylene blue (MB) as a model pollutant. The results showed that the optimized composite containing 75% NiSe2 with ZnO exhibited outstanding photocatalytic efficiency of 97%. The degradation of MB dye by NiSe2, ZnO, and their composites followed the pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics (Langmuir-Hinshelwood model). Furthermore, the prepared NiSe2-ZnO composite displayed exceptional reusability and stability over a number of cycles, demonstrating its practical applicability. This research presents unique findings, showcasing the comparative antibacterial performance of NiSe2, ZnO, and NiSe2-ZnO nanocomposites against Bacillus cereus (B. cereus). Of all the prepared photocatalysts, the 75% NiSe2-ZnO nanocomposite revealed the best performance, exhibiting an inhibition zone of 28 mm.

AB In the uplink machine-type communication (MTC) system, a combination of grant-free transmission and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) emerges to reduce the control overhead and transmission latency. In the grant-free scenario, the base station needs to identify the active devices and estimate the channel state information before the data detection. However, due to the lack of a scheduling process, the user activity detection (UAD) and channel estimation (CE) are both challenging, especially when short non-orthogonal preambles are adopted. In this paper, by exploiting the framework of the compressive sensing-based algorithm, we propose a novel deep learning architecture, namely UAD and CE Neural Network (UAD-CE-NN), to effectively solve the joint UAD and CE problem for grant-free NOMA. In the proposed scheme, the user activity and channel state information hidden in the received data signals are also exploited to aid the preamble for higher detection accuracy. Specifically, UAD-CE-NN is composed of two stages: we first build a preamble detection neural network for a tentative UAD-CE; a data detection neural network is then deployed to exploit the data signals. Compared with the conventional schemes, the proposed scheme obtains much higher accuracy for both the UAD and CE, especially when short preamble sequences are employed.

AB Few-shot node classification is tasked to provide accurate predictions for nodes from novel classes with only few representative labeled nodes. This problem has drawn tremendous attention for its projection to prevailing real-world applications, such as product categorization for newly added commodity categories on an E-commerce platform with scarce records or diagnoses for rare diseases on a patient similarity graph. To tackle such challenging label scarcity issues in the non-Euclidean graph domain, meta-learning has become a successful and predominant paradigm. More recently, inspired by the development of graph self-supervised learning, transferring pretrained node embeddings for few-shot node classification could be a promising alternative to meta-learning but remains unexposed. In this work, we empirically demonstrate the potential of an alternative framework, Transductive Linear Probing, that transfers pretrained node embeddings, which are learned from graph contrastive learning methods. We further extend the setting of few-shot node classification from standard fully supervised to a more realistic self-supervised setting, where meta-learning methods cannot be easily deployed due to the shortage of supervision from training classes. Surprisingly, even without any ground-truth labels, transductive linear probing with self-supervised graph contrastive pretraining can outperform the state-of-the-art fully supervised meta-learning based methods under the same protocol. We hope this work can shed new light on few-shot node classification problems and foster future research on learning from scarcely labeled instances on graphs.

AB Autonomous Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) such as quadrotors equipped with manipulation mechanisms have the potential to assist humans in tasks such as construction and package delivery. Cables are a promising option for manipulation mechanisms due to their low weight, low cost, and simple design. However, designing control and planning strategies for cable mechanisms presents challenges due to indirect load actuation, nonlinear configuration space, and highly coupled system dynamics. In this paper, we propose a novel Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) method that enables a team of quadrotors to manipulate a rigid-body payload in all 6 degrees of freedom via suspended cables. Our approach can concurrently exploit, as part of the receding horizon optimization, the available mechanical system redundancies to perform additional tasks such as inter-robot separation and obstacle avoidance while respecting payload dynamics and actuator constraints. To address real-time computational requirements and scalability, we employ a lightweight state vector parametrization that includes only payload states in all six degrees of freedom. This also enables the planning of trajectories on the SE(3) manifold load configuration space, thereby also reducing planning complexity. We validate the proposed approach through simulation and real-world experiments.

AB In this study, we conduct extensive high-pressure experiments to investigate phase stability in the cobalt-nitrogen system. Through a combination of synthesis in a laser-heated diamond anvil cell, first-principles calculations, Raman spectroscopy, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction, we establish the stability fields of known high-pressure phases, hexagonal NiAs-type CoN, and marcasite-type CoN2 within the pressure range of 50-90 GPa. We synthesize and characterize previously unknown nitrides, Co3N2, Pnma-CoN and two polynitrides, CoN3 and CoN5, within the pressure range of 90-120 GPa. Both polynitrides exhibit novel types of polymeric nitrogen chains and networks. CoN3 feature branched-type nitrogen trimers (N3) and CoN5 show pi-bonded nitrogen chain. As the nitrogen content in the cobalt nitride increases, the CoN6 polyhedral frameworks transit from face-sharing (in CoN) to edge-sharing (in CoN2 and CoN3), and finally to isolated (in CoN5). Our study provides insights into the intricate interplay between structure evolution, bonding arrangements, and high-pressure synthesis in polynitrides, expanding the knowledge for the development of advanced energy materials
   The nitridation behaviour of cobalt nitride unfolds along a progressive path under high-pressure conditions, as investigated using a laser-heated diamond anvil cell, combined with synchrotron XRD, Raman spectroscopy, and density funtional theory. Our observations reveal a sequence of CoN6 octahedral framework transformations, including face-sharing (in CoN), edge-sharing (in CoN2 and CoN3), and isolated (in CoN5) polyhedra. These changes align with the polymerization of nitrogen within the crystal. image

AB The conductivity changes associated with optical excitations and changing temperature in cobalt valence tautomer molecular thin films were investigated. Conductance switching in the presence of illumination is observed, with occasional locking in a higher conductance state, depending on the temperature, the photon energy of the illumination, and the bias voltage. Light of sufficiently short wavelengths is needed to ensure the light enhanced conductance switching, consistent with the optical absorption, but bias voltage clearly plays a role as well. The conductance switching is associated with excitations to the ligand to metal charge transfer state.
   The bistability and the conductivity changes associated with optical excitations in cobalt valence tautomer molecular thin films were investigated.

AB The rapid growth and evolution of indoor location-based services (LBS) increase the risk of location privacy breaches. Additionally, the semantic tag of locations can easily expose users' sensitive private information. This paper studies the safe reinforcement learning (RL)-based semantic location privacy protection mechanism (LPPM) in three-dimensional (3D) spaces, such as multi-story buildings. This provides a unique opportunity to derive the optimal location privacy protection (LPP) policy with safe exploration in dynamic 3D environments without knowing the accurate attack model. Safe exploration avoids selecting high-risk perturbation policies by evaluating each state-action pair's risk level. We propose a safe Dueling Double DQN (D3QN)-based 3D LPPM (SDLPPM) to adaptively explore the perturbation policy, avoiding the overestimation of Q-values and reducing the redundant exploration in similar 3D states. 3D geo-indistinguishability is used to randomly perturb users' locations. Besides, we further develop a safe A3C-based LPPM (SALPPM) to continuously select the perturbation policies to avoid discretization errors of perturbation angles and privacy budgets. This mechanism uses multi-thread technology to interact with the environment independently to accelerate the policy selection in complex 3D LPP scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed mechanisms increase privacy and reduce QoS loss compared to the benchmark mechanisms.

TI Superlattice Surface Lattice Resonances in Plasmonic Nanoparticle Arrays
   with Patterned Dielectrics
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
ID LIGHT
AB This paper describes how two-dimensional plasmonic nanoparticle lattices covered with microscale arrays of dielectric patches can show superlattice surface lattice resonances (SLRs). These optical resonances originate from multiscale diffractive coupling that can be controlled by the periodicity and size of the patterned dielectrics. The features in the optical dispersion diagram are similar to those of index-matched microscale arrays of metal nanoparticle lattices, having the same lateral dimensions as the dielectric patches. With an increase in nanoparticle size, superlattice SLRs can also support quadrupole excitations with distinct dispersion diagrams. The tunable optical band structure enabled by patterned dielectrics on plasmonic nanoparticle arrays offers prospects for enhanced nonlinear optics, nanoscale lasing, and engineered parity-time symmetries.

AB Simple Summary Carboxyl/cholinesterases (CCEs) represent a family of enzymes distributed in many organisms, including insects. Despite their relatively simple catalyzed hydrolysis reaction, CCEs facilitate insects' adaptation to chemical signals and stressors from the environment through various trajectories, including developing pesticide resistance, facilitating the adaptation of insects to their host plants, and manipulating insect behaviors. The CCE-mediated mechanisms of pesticide resistance to organophosphate, carbamate, or pyrethroid pesticides comprise enhanced metabolism, the sequestration of pesticides to prevent them from reaching their target sites, or conformational changes in target sites to prevent pesticides from binding. In addition, CCEs aid in the adaptation to chemical signals through the olfactory system by degrading insect semiochemicals. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of the classification, structures, and functions of insect CCEs, which will help the development of more sustainable pest control strategies in the future. Insects have evolved several intricate defense mechanisms to adapt to their chemical environment. Due to their versatile capabilities in hydrolytic biotransformation, insect carboxyl/cholinesterases (CCEs) play vital roles in the development of pesticide resistance, facilitating the adaptation of insects to their host plants, and manipulating insect behaviors through the olfaction system. CCEs confer insecticide resistance through the mechanisms of qualitative or quantitative changes of CCE-mediated enhanced metabolism or target-site insensitivity, and may contribute to the host plant adaptation. CCEs represent the first odorant-degrading enzymes (ODEs) discovered to degrade insect pheromones and plant odors and remain the most promising ODE candidates. Here, we summarize insect CCE classification, currently characterized insect CCE protein structure characteristics, and the dynamic roles of insect CCEs in chemical adaptation.

AB Seawater hypoxia is increasing globally and can drive declines in organismal performance across a wide range of marine taxa. However, the effects of hypoxia on early life stages (e.g., larvae and juveniles) are largely unknown, and it is unclear how evolutionary and life histories may influence these outcomes. Here, we addressed this question by comparing hypoxia responses across early life stages of three cnidarian species representing a range of life histories: the reef-building coral Galaxea fascicularis, a broadcast spawner with horizontal transmission of endosymbiotic algae (family Symbiodiniaceae); the reef-building coral Porites astreoides, a brooder with vertical endosymbiont transmission; and the estuarine sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, a non-symbiotic broadcast spawner. Transient exposure of larvae to hypoxia (dissolved oxygen < 2 mg L-1 for 6 h) led to decreased larval swimming and growth for all three species, which resulted in impaired settlement for the corals. Coral-specific responses also included larval swelling, depressed respiration rates, and decreases in symbiont densities and function. These results indicate both immediate and latent negative effects of hypoxia on cnidarian physiology and coral-algal mutualisms specifically. In addition, G. fascicularis and P. astreoides were sensitized to heat stress following hypoxia exposure, suggesting that the combinatorial nature of climate stressors will lead to declining performance for corals. However, sensitization to heat stress was not observed in N. vectensis exposed to hypoxia, suggesting that this species may be more resilient to combined stressors. Overall, these results emphasize the importance of reducing anthropogenic carbon emissions to limit further ocean deoxygenation and warming.

TI Multiscale Computational Study of Cellulose Acetate-Water Miscibility:

ID DISSOLUTION; CHEMISTRY
AB Cellulose acetate (CA), a prominent water-soluble derivative of cellulose, is a promising biodegradable ingredient that has applications in films, membranes, fibers, drug delivery, and more. In this work, we present a molecularly informed field-theoretic model for CA to explore its phase behavior in aqueous solutions. By integrating atomistic details into large-scale field-theoretic simulations via the relative entropy coarse-graining framework, our approach enables efficient calculations of CA's miscibility window as a function of the degree of substitution (DS) of cellulose hydroxyl groups with acetate side chains. This allows us to capture the intricate phase behavior of CA, particularly its unique miscibility at intermediate substitution, without relying on experimental input. Additionally, the model directly probes CA solution behavior specific to the relative DS at C2, C3, and C6 alcohol sites, providing insights for the rational design of water-soluble CA for diverse applications. This work demonstrates a promising integration of molecularly informed field theories, complementing wet-lab experimentation, for engineering the next-generation polymeric materials with precisely tailored properties.

AB Aerial robots have the potential to play a crucial role in assisting humans with complex and dangerous tasks. Nevertheless, the future industry demands innovative solutions to streamline the interaction process between humans and drones to enable seamless collaboration and efficient co-working. In this paper, we present a novel tele-immersive framework that promotes cognitive and physical collaboration between humans and robots through Mixed Reality (MR). This framework incorporates a novel bi-directional spatial awareness and a multi-modal virtual-physical interaction approaches. The former seamlessly integrates the physical and virtual worlds, offering bidirectional egocentric and exocentric environmental representations. The latter, leveraging the proposed spatial representation, further enhances the collaboration combining a robot planning algorithm for obstacle avoidance with a variable admittance control. This allows users to issue commands based on virtual forces while maintaining compatibility with the environment map. We validate the proposed approach by performing several collaborative planning and exploration tasks involving a drone and an user equipped with a MR headset.

AB Research-validated multiple-choice questions comprise an easy-to-implement instructional tool for scaffolding student learning and providing formative assessment of students' knowledge. We present findings from the implementation of a research-validated multiple-choice question sequence on the basics of two-state quantum systems, including inner products, outer products, translation between Dirac notation and matrix representation in a particular basis, and change of basis. This study was conducted in an advanced undergraduate quantum mechanics course, in both online and in-person learning environments, across three years. For each cohort, students had their learning assessed after traditional lecture-based instruction in relevant concepts before engaging with the multiple-choice question sequence. Their performance was evaluated again afterward with a similar assessment and compared to their earlier performance. We analyze, compare, and discuss the trends observed in the three implementations.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB Lateral flow assays (LFAs) are currently the most popular point-of-care diagnostics, rapidly transforming disease diagnosis from expensive doctor checkups and laboratory-based tests to potential on-the-shelf commodities. Yet, their sensitive element, a monoclonal antibody, is expensive to formulate, and their long-term storage depends on refrigeration technology that cannot be met in resource-limited areas. In this work, LCB1 affibodies (antibody mimetic miniproteins) were conjugated to bovine serum albumin (BSA) to afford a high-avidity synthetic capture (LCB1-BSA) capable of detecting the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein and virus like particles (VLPs). Substituting the monoclonal antibody 2B04 for LCB1-BSA (stable up to 60 degrees C) significantly improved the thermal stability, shelf life, and affordability of plasmonic-fluor-based LFAs (p-LFAs). Furthermore, this substitution significantly improved the sensitivity of p-LFAs toward the spike protein and VLPs with precise quantitative ability over 2 and 3 orders of magnitude, respectively. LCB1-BSA sensors could detect VLPs at 100-fold lower concentrations, and this improvement, combined with their robust nature, enabled us to develop an aerosol sampling technology to detect aerosolized viral particles. Synthetic captures like LCB1-BSA can increase the ultrasensitivity, availability, sustainability, and long-term accuracy of LFAs while also decreasing their manufacturing costs.

AB We present a set of generalized quantum loop models that provably exhibit topologically stable ergodicity breaking. These results hold for both periodic and open boundary conditions, and derive from a one -form symmetry (notably not being restricted to sectors of extremal one -form charge). We identify simple models in which this one -form symmetry can be emergent, giving rise to the aforementioned ergodicity breaking as an exponentially long-lived prethermal phenomenon. We unveil a web of dualities that connects these models, in certain limits, to models that have previously been discussed in the literature. We also identify nonlocal conserved quantities in such models, which correspond to patterns of system -spanning domain walls and are robust to the addition of arbitrary k -local perturbations.

AB This paper proposes a computationally efficient and effective data-driven modeling framework for dynamical systems. The proposed modeling framework employs a collection of shallow neural networks known as Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) to model local system behaviors along with data-driven inferred transitions among local models to establish a neural hybrid automaton model. First, the sampled system inputs are mapped to the corresponding feature spaces to obtain data-driven partitions, which subsequently define the transitions and invariants of the neural hybrid automaton model through a novel data-driven mode clustering process. Then, a collection of ELMs are trained to approximate the local dynamics. The learning processes integrate a segmented data merging procedure for location identification and a local dynamics modeling process. The proposed neural hybrid automaton models can capture behaviors of complex dynamical systems with high modeling precision but significantly lower computational complexities in computationally expensive tasks such as training and verification, which are traditionally considered to be computationally expensive tasks for neural network models. A computationally efficient set-valued reachability analysis method which is commonly used in safety verification is then developed based on interval analysis and a novel Split and Combine process. Finally, applications to modeling the limit cycle and human handwritten motions are presented to show the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.

   minimization; compressed sensing

AB Overparameterized models may have many interpolating solutions; implicit regularization refers to the hidden preference of a particular optimization method towards a certain interpolating solution among the many. A by now established line of work has shown that (stochastic) gradient descent tends to have an implicit bias towards low rank and/or sparse solutions when used to train deep linear networks, explaining to some extent why overparameterized neural network models trained by gradient descent tend to have good generalization performance in practice. However, existing theory for square-loss objectives often requires very small initialization of the trainable weights, which is at odds with the larger scale at which weights are initialized in practice for faster convergence and better generalization performance. In this paper, we aim to close this gap by incorporating and analysing gradient flow (continuous-time version of gradient descent) with weight normalization, where the weight vector is reparameterized in terms of polar coordinates, and gradient flow is applied to the polar coordinates. By analysing key invariants of the gradient flow and using Lojasiewicz's Theorem, we show that weight normalization also has an implicit bias towards sparse solutions in the diagonal linear model, but that in contrast to plain gradient flow, weight normalization enables a robust bias that persists even if the weights are initialized at practically large scale. Experiments suggest that the gains in both convergence speed and robustness of the implicit bias are improved dramatically using weight normalization in overparameterized diagonal linear network models.

AB This study presents the "Dynamic Land Cover Evapotranspiration Model Algorithm: DyLEMa" for continuous spatiotemporal evapotranspiration (ET) estimates across diverse land uses. DyLEMa employs a coupled Random Forest model with a novel dynamic recalibrating strategy to improve pre-optimized seasonal hyperparameters following satellite acquisition alongside land cover classes. An analysis of feature importance indicated the significant variability in ET processes across different land cover classes and seasons. Hence, DyLEMa was applied to 20 years of daily 30x30 m pixel resolution Landsat-derived ET data in Illinois to address spatial and temporal discontinuities due to cloud contamination and sensor failures. DyLEMa performance was evaluated on Eddy Covariance measurements to find out that DyLEMa predictions reduced the average PBIAS error from + 31 % to -7% compared to existing US Geological Survey ET products. Spatially, DyLEMa underscores the value of a land cover-aware approach in ET estimation under varied cloud cover rates and their ability to preserve landscape features. However, the performance of DyLEMa was affected by the quality of land cover classification, suggesting the need for a refined region-specific land cover classification. DyLEMa's flexibility and performance suggest its applicability to other regions and satellite datasets, offering a promising reduction in uncertainty of ET estimates with impacts on environmental and water resources assessments on regional scales.

AB Multifunctional monomers enable the synthesis of polymer networks by adapting the polymerization methods used for conventional linear polymer synthesis. Both step and chain polymerization methods can be combined with multifunctional monomers to generate networks with essentially infinite molecular weight. Traditional networks are held together through covalent crosslinks that derive from the multifunctional monomers. Additional approaches to network like materials involve polymer phase separation, forming non-covalent crosslink-points. This contribution provides an overview of the approaches and chemistries available for polymer network synthesis, and serves as a resource for researchers exploring polymer networks or attempting alternative approaches to network development.

AB Battery storage is a key technology for distributed renewable energy integration. Wider applications of battery storage systems call for smarter and more flexible deployment models to improve their economic viability. Here we propose a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) model that flexibly coordinates both portable energy storage systems (PESSs) and stationary energy storage systems (SESSs) in a grid. PESSs are batteries and power conversion systems loaded on vehicles that travel between grid nodes with price differences to alleviate grid congestion. PESSs can charge/discharge at grid nodes or swap (part of) batteries with SESSs for profit maximization. We introduce a spatiotemporal decision-making framework for HESS including the planning of SESS and the on-demand dispatch of PESS. We propose a two-phase decision-making algorithm (TPDM), where the first phase uses a spatiotemporal cost-effectiveness aggregation method to determine the optimal SESS location; the second phase shapes a low-complexity solution space by arc destroying and repairing. The results show that HESS achieves significant arbitrage benefit improvement in 86.3% of the operating periods through a year compared with SESS and PESS alone. Compared with commercial solver, the proposed TPDM, on average, can reduce the computational time by 95.5% with an optimality of 1.04%. Note to Practitioners-Battery storage and electric vehicles (EVs) play a crucial role in renewable energy integration and in shaping a low-carbon and sustainable energy and transportation systems. To achieve efficient and scalable management of battery storage across energy and transportation systems, we incorporate the portable energy storage (i.e., batteries transported by vehicles) and stationary energy storage (i.e., batteries placed at grids), into a hybrid energy storage system (HESS), and develop efficient planning framework and scheduling algorithms. Specifically, the proposed methods can provide decision supports for the owners of battery assets to determine the optimal SESS location and for the high-quality coordination of battery charging, swapping, and routing in a HESS. Our methods also have potentials in the on-demand applications of battery storage and EVs across energy and transportation systems, such as ancillary services, grid investment deferral, and battery trading and sharing.

AB Behavioral variation abounds in nature. This variation is important for adaptation and speciation, but its molecular basis remains elusive. Here, we use a hybrid zone between two subspecies of songbirds that differ in migration - an ecologically important and taxonomically widespread behavior---to gain insight into this topic. We measure gene expression in five brain regions. Differential expression between migratory states was dominated by circadian genes in all brain regions. The remaining patterns were largely brain-region specific. For example, expression differences between the subspecies that interact with migratory state likely help maintain reproductive isolation in this system and were documented in only three brain regions. Contrary to existing work on regulatory mechanisms underlying species-specific traits, two lines of evidence suggest that trans- (vs. cis) regulatory changes underlie these patterns - no evidence for allele-specific expression in hybrids and minimal associations between genomic differentiation and expression differences. Additional work with hybrids shows expression levels were often distinct (transgressive) from parental forms. Behavioral contrasts and functional enrichment analyses allowed us to connect these patterns to mitonuclear incompatibilities and compensatory responses to stress that could exacerbate selection on hybrids and contribute to speciation.
   Little is known about the genetic basis of many natural behaviours and how they contribute to speciation. Here the authors address this by identifying genes linked to migration of a songbird, investigating how these gene are regulated, and connecting them to potential barriers between species.

AB The ability of aerial robots to operate in the presence of failures is crucial in various applications that demand continuous operations, such as surveillance, monitoring, and inspection. In this paper, we propose a fault-tolerant control strategy for quadrotors that can adapt to single and dual complete rotor failures. Our approach augments a classic geometric tracking controller on SO(3) x R-3 to accommodate the effects of rotor failures. We provide an in-depth analysis of several attitude error metrics to identify the most appropriate design choice for fault-tolerant control strategies. To assess the effectiveness of these metrics, we evaluate trajectory tracking accuracies. Simulation results demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach.

AB The Pd-Zn gamma-brass phase provides exciting opportunities for synthesizing site-isolated catalysts with precisely controlled Pd active site ensembles. Introducing a third metallic element into the gamma-brass lattice further perturbs the catalytic active site ensembles. Here, we introduce coinage metallic elements M (M = Cu, Ag, and Au) into the Pd-Zn gamma-brass phase and investigate the site occupation factors of each element in the gamma-brass lattice. The CALculation of PHAse Diagrams (CALPHAD) modeling approach supported by energetics predicted by the density functional theory and X-ray and neutron diffraction with Rietveld refinement were used to identify the SOF on each Wyckoff site for various M amounts alloyed into the Pd-Zn gamma-brass phase. The present analysis unveils the strong preference for Pd occupying the outer tetrahedral (OT) site in the gamma-brass lattice, while the coinage metallic elements tend to substitute for Zn on the octahedral (OH) site. The determination of site occupancy in the bulk M-Pd-Zn gamma-brass phase provides opportunities to investigate and tailor potential catalytically active site ensembles in the gamma-brass phase materials.

AB The capability to autonomously track a noncooperative target is a key technological requirement for micro aerial vehicles. In this paper, we propose an output feedback control scheme based on deep reinforcement learning for controlling a micro aerial vehicle to persistently track a flying target while maintaining visual contact. The proposed method leverages relative position data for control, relaxing the assumption of having access to full state information which is typical of related approaches in literature. Moreover, we exploit classical robustness indicators in the learning process through domain randomization to increase the robustness of the learned policy. Experimental results validate the proposed approach for target tracking, demonstrating high performance and robustness with respect to mass mismatches and control delays. The resulting nonlinear controller significantly outperforms a standard model-based design in numerous off-nominal scenarios.

AB When a star undergoes core collapse, a vast amount of energy is released in a similar to 10 s long burst of neutrinos of all species. Inverse beta decay in the star's hydrogen envelope causes an electromagnetic cascade that ultimately results in a flare of gamma rays-an "echo" of the neutrino burst-at the characteristic energy of 0.511 MeV. We study the phenomenology and detectability of this flare. Its luminosity curve is characterized by a fast, seconds-long rise and an equally fast decline, with a minute- or hour-long plateau in between. For a near-Earth star (distance D less than or similar to 1 kpc) the echo will be observable at near future gamma-ray telescopes with an effective area of 103 cm2 or larger. Its observation will inform us on the envelope size and composition. In conjunction with the direct detection of the neutrino burst, it will also give information on the neutrino emission away from the line of sight and will enable tests of neutrino propagation effects between the stellar surface and Earth.

AB The concept of teacher professional vision suggests that experienced teachers, compared to novice teachers, might be better at making accurate judgments of students' learning characteristics, which can be explained by their advanced reasoning in diagnostic situations. This study examines experienced and novice teachers' diagnoses of different student characteristic profiles: three inconsistent profiles (overestimating, uninterested, and underestimating) and two consistent profiles (strong and struggling). We examined both experienced (n = 19 in-service mathematics teachers) and novice teachers (n = 24 pre-service mathematics teachers) to determine the extent of differences in their judgment accuracy and their diagnostic reasoning about observable cues when diagnosing student profiles while watching a lesson video. ANOVA results indicate that experienced teachers generally achieved a higher judgment accuracy in diagnosing student profiles compared to novice teachers. Moreover, epistemic network analysis of observable cues in experienced and novice teachers' diagnostic reasoning showed that, compared to novice teachers, experienced teachers make more relations between a broader spectrum of both surface cues (e.g., a student's hand-raising behavior) and deep cues (e.g., a student being interested in the subject). Experienced teachers thereby construct more comprehensive and robust reasoning compared to novice teachers. The findings highlight how professional experience shapes teachers' professional skills, such as diagnosing, and suggest strategies for enhancing teacher training.

AB Formalized 1-category theory forms a core component of various libraries of mathematical proofs. However, more sophisticated results in fields from algebraic topology to theoretical physics, where objects have "higher structure," rely on infinite-dimensional categories in place of 1-dimensional categories, and infinity-category theory has thusfar proved unamenable to computer formalization.
   Using a new proof assistant called Rzk, which is designed to support Riehl-Shulman's simplicial extension of homotopy type theory for synthetic infinity-category theory, we provide the first formalizations of results from infinity-category theory. This includes in particular a formalization of the Yoneda lemma, often regarded as the fundamental theorem of category theory, a theorem which roughly states that an object of a given category is determined by its relationship to all of the other objects of the category. A key feature of our framework is that, thanks to the synthetic theory, many constructions are automatically natural or functorial. We plan to use Rzk to formalize further results from infinity-category theory, such as the theory of limits and colimits and adjunctions.

ID METRIC DETAILS; OBJECTS
AB Natural-language spatial relations between geographic entities (geoentities) reflect diverse perceptions influenced by factors like location, culture, and linguistic conventions. These relations play a crucial role in supporting geospatial tasks, such as question answering and cognitive reasoning. While prior studies focused on a limited set of human-selected spatial terms and geometric attributes, they often overlooked essential semantic attributes. To overcome this limitation, we developed a Spatial Relation-based Knowledge Graph Embedding framework, SR-KGE, with new KG fusion functions to predict spatial relation terms among distinct geoentities. This method not only considers graph structures and the diversity of natural language expressions in the embedding and learning process, but also incorporates geoentity types as a constraint to capture spatial and semantic relations more accurately. Our experiments on two knowledge graph datasets, one small-scale and one large-scale, have both shown its superior performance in spatial relation inference compared to popular KGE models, including TransE, RotatE, and HAKE. We hope our research will advance the classic study of natural language described spatial relations in a more automated and intelligent way.

AB Land-based nutrient inputs to the ocean have been linked to increased coastal productivity, subsurface acidification and O2 loss, even in upwelling systems like the Southern California Bight. However, whether eutrophication alters the [environment's] capacity to support key taxa has yet to be evaluated for this region. Here, we assess the impact of land-based nutrient inputs on the availability of aerobic and calcifying habitat for key pelagic taxa using ocean model simulations. We find that acute, lethal conditions are not commonly induced in epipelagic surface waters, but that sublethal, ecologically relevant changes are pervasive. Land-based nutrient inputs reduce the potential aerobic and calcifier habitat during late summer, when viable habitat is at its seasonal minimum. A region of annually recurring habitat compression is predicted 30 - 90 km from the mainland, southeast of Santa Catalina Island. Here, both aerobic and calcifier habitat is vertically compressed by, on average, 25%, but can be as much as 60%. This effect can be traced to enhanced remineralization of organic matter that originates from the coast. These findings suggest that effects of land-based nutrients are not restricted to chemistry but extend to habitat capacity for multiple taxa of ecological and economic importance. Considerable uncertainty exists, however, in how this habitat compression translates to population-level effects.

DT Article
AB Differentially Private Federated Learning (DP-FL) has garnered attention as a collaborative machine learning approach that ensures formal privacy. Most DP-FL approaches ensure DP at the record-level within each silo for cross-silo FL. However, a single user's data may extend across multiple silos, and the desired user-level DP guarantee for such a setting remains unknown. In this study, we present Uldp-FL, a novel FL framework designed to guarantee user-level DP in cross-silo FL where a single user's data may belong to multiple silos. Our proposed algorithm directly ensures user-level DP through per-user weighted clipping, departing from group-privacy approaches. We provide a theoretical analysis of the algorithm's privacy and utility. Additionally, we improve the utility of the proposed algorithm with an enhanced weighting strategy based on user record distribution and design a novel private protocol that ensures no additional information is revealed to the silos and the server. Experiments on real-world datasets show substantial improvements in our methods in privacy-utility trade-offs under user-level DP compared to baseline methods. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first FL framework that effectively provides user-level DP in the general cross-silo FL setting.

AB Decision-makers often observe the occurrence of events through a reporting process. City governments, for example, rely on resident reports to find and then resolve urban infrastructural problems such as fallen street trees, flooded basements, or rat infestations. Without additional assumptions, there is no way to distinguish events that occur but are not reported from events that truly did not occur-a fundamental problem in settings with positive-unlabeled data. Because disparities in reporting rates correlate with resident demographics, addressing incidents only on the basis of reports leads to systematic neglect in neighborhoods that are less likely to report events. We show how to overcome this challenge by leveraging the fact that events are spatially correlated. Our framework uses a Bayesian spatial latent variable model to infer event occurrence probabilities and applies it to storm-induced flooding reports in New York City, further pooling results across multiple storms. We show that a model accounting for under-reporting and spatial correlation predicts future reports more accurately than other models, and further induces a more equitable set of inspections: its allocations better reflect the population and provide equitable service to non-white, less traditionally educated, and lower-income residents. This finding reflects heterogeneous reporting behavior learned by the model: reporting rates are higher in Census tracts with higher populations, proportions of white residents, and proportions of owner-occupied households. Our work lays the groundwork for more equitable proactive government services, even with disparate reporting behavior.

AB We investigate how cosmic rays (CRs) affect thermal and hydrostatic stability of circumgalactic (CGM) gas, in simulations with both CR streaming and diffusion. Local thermal instability can be suppressed by CR-driven entropy mode propagation, in accordance with previous analytic work. However, there is only a narrow parameter regime where this operates, before CRs overheat the background gas. As mass dropout from thermal instability causes the background density and hence plasma beta equivalent to P-g/P-B to fall, the CGM becomes globally unstable. At the cool disc-to-hot-halo interface, a sharp drop in density boosts Alfven speeds and CR gradients, driving a transition from diffusive to streaming transport. CR forces and heating strengthen, while countervailing gravitational forces and radiative cooling weaken, resulting in a loss of both hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium. In lower beta haloes, CR heating drives a hot, single-phase diffuse wind with velocities v proportional to (t(heat)/t(ff))(-1), which exceeds the escape velocity when t(heat)/t(ff) less than or similar to 0.4. In higher beta haloes, where the Alfven Mach number is higher, CR forces drive multi-phase winds with cool, dense fountain flows and significant turbulence. These flows are CR dominated due to 'trapping' of CRs by weak transverse B-fields, and have the highest mass loading factors. Thus, local thermal instability can result in winds or fountain flows where either the heat or momentum input of CRs dominates.

AB We investigate the temperature- and density-dependence of effective pair potentials for 1-site coarse-grained (CG) models of two industrial solvents, 1,4-dioxane and tetrahydrofuran. We observe that the calculated pair potentials are much more sensitive to density than to temperature. The generalized-Yvon-Born-Green framework reveals that this striking density-dependence reflects corresponding variations in the many-body correlations that determine the environment-mediated indirect contribution to the pair mean force. Moreover, we demonstrate, perhaps surprisingly, that this density-dependence is not important for accurately modeling the intermolecular structure. Accordingly, we adopt a density-independent interaction potential and transfer the density-dependence of the calculated pair potentials into a configuration-independent volume potential. Furthermore, we develop a single global potential that accurately models the intermolecular structure and pressure-volume equation of state across a very wide range of liquid state points. Consequently, this work provides fundamental insight into the density-dependence of effective pair potentials and also provides a significant step toward developing predictive CG models for efficiently modeling industrial solvents.

AB This paper presents (DNN)-N-3, a neural network learning tool for dual-level dynamic system modeling. This tool aims to model the dynamic system under a dual-level modeling framework, i.e., modeling the system dynamics through a computationally efficient and precise low-level neural hybrid system and an interpretable high-level transition system abstraction. Given samples of the dynamic system and user specifications, the proposed tool can generate a low-level distributive learning framework consisting of shallow neural network approximations for local dynamics and its high-level transition system abstraction that allows Computational Tree Logic (CTL) formulae verification.

ID ELECTRON BACKSCATTER DIFFRACTION; HIGH-STRENGTH; MECHANISM
AB The far-from-equilibrium solidification during additive manufacturing often creates large residual stresses that induce solid-state cracking. Here we present a strategy to suppress solid-state cracking in an additively manufactured AlCrFe2Ni2 high-entropy alloy via engineering phase transformation pathway. We investigate the solidification microstructures formed during laser powder-bed fusion and directed energy deposition, encompassing a broad range of cooling rates. At high cooling rates (10(4)-10(6) K/s), we observe a single-phase BCC/B2 microstructure that is susceptible to solid-state cracking. At low cooling rates (10(2)-10(4) K/s), FCC phase precipitates out from the BCC/B2 matrix, resulting in enhanced ductility (similar to 10 %) and resistance to solid-state cracking. Site-specific residual stress/strain analysis reveals that the ductile FCC phase can largely accommodate residual stresses, a feature which helps relieve residual strains within the BCC/B2 phase to prevent cracking. Our work underscores the value of exploiting the toolbox of phase transformation pathway engineering for material design during additive manufacturing.

TI Uhlmann quench and geometric dynamic quantum phase transition of mixed
   states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
LA English
DT Article
AB Dynamic quantum phase transitions (DQPT) following quantum quenches exhibit singular behavior of the overlap between the initial and evolved states. Here we present a formalism to incorporate a geometric phase into quench dynamics of mixed quantum states, a process named the Uhlmann quench, based on the Uhlmann parallel transport. To overcome the incompatibility between the Uhlmann parallel-transport condition and Hamiltonian dynamics, we formulate the evolution of purification of the density matrix in a form which not only respects the dynamics according to the density matrix but also follows the Uhlmann parallel-transport condition to generate a geometric phase after a quantum quench. For cyclic processes exemplified by a spin-1/2 system, geometric DQPTs (GDQPTs) can emerge with both singular behavior in the dynamic analog of the free energy and jumps of the geometric phase. Moreover, the Uhlmann phase reflecting the holonomy is generated at the end of each cycle. The Uhlmann quench thus paves the way for investigating the interplay between quantum dynamics and geometric processes in mixed states.

AB A 23-month-old neutered male dog of unknown ancestry presented with a history of progressive neurological signs that included anxiety, cognitive impairment, tremors, seizure activity, ataxia, and pronounced visual impairment. The clinical signs were accompanied by global brain atrophy. Due to progression in the severity of disease signs, the dog was euthanized at 26 months of age. An examination of the tissues collected at necropsy revealed dramatic intracellular accumulations of autofluorescent inclusions in the brain, retina, and cardiac muscle. The inclusions were immunopositive for subunit c of mitochondrial ATP synthase, and their ultrastructural appearances were similar to those of lysosomal storage bodies that accumulate in some neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) diseases. The dog also exhibited widespread neuroinflammation. Based on these findings, the dog was deemed likely to have suffered from a form of NCL. A whole genome sequence analysis of the proband's DNA revealed a homozygous C to T substitution that altered the intron 3-exon 4 splice site of CLN6. Other mutations in CLN6 cause NCL diseases in humans and animals, including dogs. The CLN6 protein was undetectable with immunolabeling in the tissues of the proband. Based on the clinical history, fluorescence and electron-microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and molecular genetic findings, the disorder in this dog was classified as an NCL resulting from the absence of the CLN6 protein. Screening the dog's genome for a panel of breed-specific polymorphisms indicated that its ancestry included numerous breeds, with no single breed predominating. This suggests that the CLN6 disease variant is likely to be present in other mixed-breed dogs and at least some ancestral breeds, although it is likely to be rare since other cases have not been reported to date.

AB The (d, 2He) reaction in inverse kinematics has been developed for experiments with rare-isotope beams to constrain electron-capture rates needed for astrophysical simulations of processes in dense nuclear environments such as supernovae and neutron star crusts. The first experiment focused on the measurement of the 14O(d, 2He) and 13N(d, 2He) reactions in inverse kinematics, utilizing the active-target time-projection chamber placed in front of the S800 magnetic spectrograph. This work focuses on the experimental and analysis details, and presents the results for the 13N(d, 2He) reaction, which is important for constraining electron captures rates on 13N in the preexplosion convective phase of Type Ia supernova. The extracted Gamow-Teller transition strengths associated with electron capture on 13N are consistent with those previously obtained from the analog transitions from 13C. The successful development of the (d, 2He) reaction in inverse kinematics presents a novel opportunity for performing experiments aimed at constraining electron-capture rates in nuclei far from stability.

AB Many studies have explored the impact of extreme heat on health, but few have investigated localized heathealth outcomes across a wide area. We examined fine-scale variability in vulnerable areas, considering population distribution, local weather, and landscape characteristics. Using 36 different heat event definitions, we identified the most dangerous types of heat events based on minimum, maximum, and diurnal temperatures with varying thresholds and durations. Focusing on California's diverse climate, elevation, and population distribution, we analyzed hospital admissions for various causes of admission (2004-2013). Our matching approach identified vulnerable zip codes, even with small populations, on absolute and relative scales. Bayesian Hierarchical models leveraged spatial correlation. We ranked the 36 heat event types by attributable hospital admissions per zip code and provided code, simulated data, and an interactive web app for reproducibility. Our findings showed high variation in heat-related hospitalizations in coastal cities and substantial heat burdens in the Central Valley. Diurnal heat events had the greatest impact in the Central Valley, while nighttime extreme heat events drove burdens in the southeastern desert. This spatially informed approach guides local policies, prioritizing dangerous heat events to reduce the heat-health burden. The methodology is applicable to other regions, informing early warning systems and characterizing extreme heat impacts.

TI Sjöqvist quantum geometric tensor of finite-temperature mixed states
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
LA English
DT Article
AB The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) reveals local geometric properties and associated topological information of quantum states. Here a generalization of the QGT to mixed quantum states at finite temperatures based on the Sj & ouml;qvist distance is developed. The resulting Sj & ouml;qvist QGT is invariant under gauge transformations of individual spectrum levels of the density matrix. A Pythagorean-like relation connects the distances and gauge transformations, which clarifies the role of the parallel-transport condition. The real part of the QGT naturally decomposes into a sum of the Fisher-Rao metric and Fubini-Study metric, allowing a distinction between different contributions to the quantum distance. The imaginary part of the QGT is proportional to a weighted summation of the Berry curvatures, which leads to a geometric phase for mixed states under certain conditions. We present three examples of different dimensions to illustrate the temperature dependence of the QGT and a discussion on possible implications.

AB An in-depth investigation of transition metal impurities (Hf, Zr, Nb, and W) is presented as shallow donors in monoclinic Ga2O3 using first-principles calculations within the framework of density functional theory. A combination of semilocal and hybrid functionals is used to predict their binding energies and hyperfine parameters. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) allows performing calculations for supercells of up to 2500 atoms, enabling an extrapolation to the dilute limit. The shortcoming of GGA in correctly describing the electron localization is then overcome by the use of the hybrid functional. Results are presented and discussed in light of the application of these transition-metal elements as shallow donors in Ga2O3 and their identification in the experiment. The methodology applied here can be used in calculations for shallow donors in other systems.

AB Quadrotors have gained popularity over the last decade, aiding humans in complex tasks such as search and rescue, mapping and exploration. Despite their mechanical simplicity and versatility compared to other types of aerial vehicles, they remain vulnerable to rotor failures. In this paper, we propose an algorithmic and mechanical approach to addressing the quadrotor fault-tolerant problem in case of rotor failures. First, we present a fault-tolerant detection and control scheme that includes various attitude error metrics. The scheme transitions to a fault-tolerant control mode by surrendering the yaw control. Subsequently, to ensure compatibility with platform sensing constraints, we investigate the relationship between variations in robot rotational drag, achieved through a modular mechanical design appendage, resulting in yaw rates within sensor limits. This analysis offers a platformagnostic framework for designing more reliable and robust quadrotors in the event of rotor failures. Extensive experimental results validate the proposed approach providing insights into successfully designing a cost-effective quadrotor capable of fault-tolerant control. The overall design enhances safety in scenarios of faulty rotors, without the need for additional sensors or computational resources.

AB Forty years ago Witten suggested that dark matter could be composed of macroscopic clusters of strange quark matter. This idea was very popular for several years, but it dropped out of fashion once lattice quantum chromodynamics calculations indicated that the confinement/deconfinement transition, at small baryonic chemical potential, is not first order, which seemed to be a crucial requirement in order to produce large clusters of quarks. Here, we revisit the conditions under which strangelets can be produced in the Early Universe. We discuss the impact of an instability in the hadronic phase separating a low density, positive-strange-charge phase from a high-density phase with a negative strange charge. This second phase can rapidly stabilize by forming colour-superconducting gaps. The strangelets then undergo partial evaporation. In this way, we obtain distributions of their sizes in agreement with the observational constraints and we discuss the many astrophysical and cosmological implications of these objects. Finally, we examine the most promising techniques to detect this type of strangelets. We also show that strangelets can exist with masses less than or similar to 10(17) g, while primordial black holes are ruled out in that mass range, allowing us to distinguish between these two dark matter candidates.

AB Achieving increased energy density under extreme operating conditions remains a major challenge in rechargeable batteries. Herein, we demonstrate an all-fluorinated ester-based electrolyte comprising partially fluorinated carboxylate and carbonate esters. This electrolyte exhibits temperature-resilient physicochemical properties and moderate ion-paired solvation, leading to a half solvent-separated and half contact-ion pair in a sole electrolyte. As a result, facile desolvation and preferential reduction of anions/fluorinated co-solvents for LiF-dominated interphases are achieved without compromising ionic conductivity (>1 mS cm(-1) even at -40 degrees C). These advantageous features were found to apply to both lithium metal and sulfur-based electrodes even under extreme operating conditions, allowing stable cycling of Li || sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) full cells with high SPAN loading (>3.5 mAh cm(-2)) and thin Li anode (50 mu m) at -40, 23 and 50 degrees C. This work offers a promising path for designing temperature-resilient electrolytes to support high energy density Li metal batteries operating in extreme conditions.

AB Emerging evidence reveals the fundamental role of the gut microbiome in human health. Among various factors regulating our gut microbiome, diet is one of the most indispensable and prominent one. Inulin is one of the most widely-studied dietary fiber for its beneficial prebiotic effects by positively modulating the gut microbiome and microbial metabolites. Recent research underscores sexual dimorphism and sex-specific disparities in microbiome and also diet-microbiome interactions. However, whether and how the prebiotic effects of dietary fiber differ among sexes remain underexplored. To this end, we herein examine sex-specific differences in the prebiotic effects of inulin on gut microbiome and metabolome in a humanized murine model of aging i.e., aged mice carrying human fecal microbiota. The findings demonstrate that inulin exerts prebiotic effects, but in a sex-dependent manner. Overall, inulin increases the proportion of Bacteroides, Blautia, and glycine, while decreasing Eggerthella, Lactococcus, Streptococcus, trimethylamine, 3-hydroxyisobutyrate, leucine and methionine in both sexes. However, we note sex-specific effects of inulin including suppression of f_Enteroccaceae:_, Odoribacter, bile acids, malonate, thymine, valine, acetoin, and ethanol while promotion of Dubosiella, pyruvate, and glycine in males. Whereas, suppression of Faecalibaculum, Lachnoclostridium, Schaedlerella, phenylalanine and enhancement of Parasutterella, Phocaeicola, f_Lachnospiraceae;_, Barnesiella, Butyricimonas, glycine, propionate, acetate and glutamate are observed in females. Altogether, the study reveals that prebiotic mechanisms of dietary fiber vary in a sex-dependent manner, underscoring the importance of including both sexes in preclinical/clinical studies to comprehend the mechanisms and functional aspects of dietary interventions for effective extrapolation and translation in precision nutrition milieus.

AB The backpropagation algorithm has experienced remarkable success in training large-scale artificial neural networks; however, its biological plausibility has been strongly criticized, and it remains an open question whether the brain employs supervised learning mechanisms akin to it. Here, we propose correlative information maximization between layer activations as an alternative normative approach to describe the signal propagation in biological neural networks in both forward and backward directions. This new framework addresses many concerns about the biological-plausibility of conventional artificial neural networks and the backpropagation algorithm. The coordinate descent-based optimization of the corresponding objective, combined with the mean square error loss function for fitting labeled supervision data, gives rise to a neural network structure that emulates a more biologically realistic network of multi-compartment pyramidal neurons with dendritic processing and lateral inhibitory neurons. Furthermore, our approach provides a natural resolution to the weight symmetry problem between forward and backward signal propagation paths, a significant critique against the plausibility of the conventional backpropagation algorithm. This is achieved by leveraging two alternative, yet equivalent forms of the correlative mutual information objective. These alternatives intrinsically lead to forward and backward prediction networks without weight symmetry issues, providing a compelling solution to this long-standing challenge.

AB In STEM education, grit is increasingly the focus of research, with scholars and educators seeking to develop and test interventions that will enhance persistence. As part of the special issue Centering Affect and Emotion Toward Justice and Dignity in Science Education, in this paper, we use interviews with 12 white physics faculty to show that physics culture has taken up the narrative that grit is key to success in the discipline. Using affective technology (Zembylas and Leonardo, 2013), habitus (Bourdieu, 1972/1977) and emotional habitus (Gould et al. 2019) as theoretical anchors, our analysis shows that grit, as described by faculty participants, is part-and-parcel of a white physics habitus. In other words, grit acts to reproduce systems of dominance through the internalization of a set of structures, symbols, and worldviews that produce embodied, affective responses, drawing dominant actors toward particular embodiments of hard work and turning them away from others. Thus, we argue that power in physics is mediated through affect and embodiment. Employing qualitative case study methods, we theorize how whiteness, in part, is reproduced in the discipline-how physics came to and continues to be a discipline where power is concentrated in the bodies of white males. We end by joining with existing calls to refuse grit, building from the work of STEM Scholars of Color who have called attention to the suffering that is endemic to notions of schooling and school science.

AB In eye-tracked augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR), instantaneous and accurate hands-free selection of virtual elements is still a significant challenge. Though other methods that involve gazecoupled head movements or hovering can improve selection times in comparison to methods like gaze-dwell, they are either not instantaneous or have difficulty ensuring that the user's selection is deliberate. In this paper, we present EyeShadows, an eye gaze-based selection system that takes advantage of peripheral copies (shadows) of items that allow for quick selection and manipulation of an object or corresponding menus. This method is compatible with a variety of different selection tasks and controllable items, avoids the Midas touch problem, does not clutter the virtual environment, and is context sensitive. We have implemented and refined this selection tool for VR and AR, including testing with optical and video see-through (OST/VST) displays. Moreover, we demonstrate that this method can be used for a wide range of AR and VR applications, including manipulation of sliders or analog elements. We test its performance in VR against three other selection techniques, including dwell (baseline), an inertial reticle, and head-coupled selection. Results showed that selection with EyeShadows was significantly faster than dwell (baseline), outperforming in the select and search and select tasks by 29.8% and 15.7%, respectively, though error rates varied between tasks.

AB Acyliminium ions and related species are potent electrophiles that can be quite valuable in the synthesis of nitrogen-containing molecules. This manuscript describes a protocol to form these intermediates through hydride abstractions of easily accessible allylic carbamates, amides, and sulfonamides that avoids the reversibility that is possible in classical condensation-based routes. These intermediates are used in the preparation of a range of nitrogen-containing heterocycles, and in many cases high levels of stereocontrol are observed. Specifically areas of investigation include the impact of chemical structure on oxidation efficiency, the geometry of the intermediate iminium ions, the impact of a substrate stereocenter on stereocontrol, and an examination of transition state geometry.
   Acyliminium ions and related species can be formed through hydride abstraction reactions that obviate the need for leaving group installation and avoid issues of unfavorable equilibria. This allows for the study of several previously unappreciated reactivity properties of these species in the context of cyclization reactions, including intermediate geometry, transition state conformation, stereoselectivity and product geometry.image

AB GPS spoofing is a great threat to the safety of transportation systems as well as other systems that rely on GPS for navigation. This paper proposes a novel computer vision based approach for GPS spoofing detection, termed SEquential dashcam-based vEhicle localization frameworK (SEEK). SEEK utilizes vehicle dashcam images to identify a vehicle's true location and detects possible GPS spoofing attacks through verifying if the reported GPS locations of the vehicle are correct. However, it is nontrivial to use dashcam images for vehicle localization due to multiple challenges caused by real-world driving, including the complicated lighting/weather conditions, season/timing variations of the images, large blockage ratio in the images, and varying driving speeds. SEEK features a unique design with novel schemes to address complicated lighting/weather conditions, transform images to align with season changes, reduce blockage, and adopt a sequential image matching scheme. The performance evaluation shows that SEEK significantly outperforms the previous GPS spoofing detection scheme, and achieves a detection accuracy of up to 94%.

AB Volumetric muscle loss (VML) injuries due to trauma, tumor ablation, or other degenerative muscle diseases are debilitating and currently have limited options for self-repair. Advancements in 3D printing allow for the rapid fabrication of biocompatible scaffolds with designer patterns. However, the materials chosen are often stiff or brittle, which is not optimal for muscle tissue engineering. This study utilized a photopolymerizable biocom-patible elastomer - poly (glycerol sebacate) acrylate (PGSA) - to develop an in vitro model of muscle regeneration and proliferation into an acellular scaffold after VML injury. Mechanical properties of the scaffold were tuned by controlling light intensity during the 3D printing process to match the specific tension of skeletal muscle. The effect of both geometric (channel sizes between 300 and 600 mu m) and biologic (decellularized muscle extra -cellular matrix (dECM)) cues on muscle progenitor cell infiltration, proliferation, organization, and maturation was evaluated in vitro using a near-infrared fluorescent protein (iRFP) transfected cell line to assess cells in the 3D scaffold. Larger channel sizes and dECM coating were found to enhance cell proliferation and maturation, while no discernable effect on cell alignment was observed. In addition, a pilot experiment was carried out to evaluate the regenerative capacity of this scaffold in vivo after a VML injury. Overall, this platform demonstrates a simple model to study muscle progenitor recruitment and differentiation into acellular scaffolds after VML repair.

AB Short-range order (SRO), the regular and predictable arrangement of atoms over short distances, alters the mechanical properties of technologically relevant structural materials such as medium/high entropy alloys and austenitic stainless steels. In this study, we present a generalized spin cluster expansion (CE) model and show that magnetism is a primary factor influencing the level of SRO present in austenitic Fe-Ni-Cr alloys. The spin CE consists of a chemical cluster expansion combined with an Ising model for Fe-Ni-Cr austenitic alloys. It explicitly accounts for local magnetic exchange interactions, thereby capturing the effects of finite temperature magnetism on SRO. Model parameters are obtained by fitting to a first-principles data set comprising both chemically and magnetically diverse face-centered cubic configurations. The magnitude of the magnetic exchange interactions are found to be comparable to the chemical interactions. Compared to a conventional implicit magnetism CE built from only magnetic ground state configurations, the spin CE shows improved performance on several experimental benchmarks over a broad spectrum of compositions, particularly at higher temperatures due to the explicit treatment of magnetic disorder. We find that SRO is strongly influenced by alloy Cr content, since Cr atoms prefer to align antiferromagnetically with nearest neighbors but become magnetically frustrated with increasing Cr concentration. Using the spin CE, we predict that increasing the Cr concentration in typical austenitic stainless steels promotes the formation of SRO and increases order-disorder transition temperatures. This study underscores the significance of considering magnetic interactions explicitly when exploring the thermodynamic properties of complex transition metal alloys. It also highlights guidelines for customizing SRO through adjustments of alloy composition.

AB Exoskeletons have enormous potential to improve human locomotive performance1-3. However, their development and broad dissemination are limited by the requirement for lengthy human tests and handcrafted control laws2. Here we show an experiment-free method to learn a versatile control policy in simulation. Our learning-in-simulation framework leverages dynamics-aware musculoskeletal and exoskeleton models and data-driven reinforcement learning to bridge the gap between simulation and reality without human experiments. The learned controller is deployed on a custom hip exoskeleton that automatically generates assistance across different activities with reduced metabolic rates by 24.3%, 13.1% and 15.4% for walking, running and stair climbing, respectively. Our framework may offer a generalizable and scalable strategy for the rapid development and widespread adoption of a variety of assistive robots for both able-bodied and mobility-impaired individuals.

AB Ocean model simulations show variability due to intrinsic chaos and external forcing (air-sea fluxes, river input, etc.). It is important to estimate their contributions to total variability for attribution. Using variance to estimate variability might be unreliable due to non-Gaussian higher statistical moments. We show the use of non-parametric information theory metrics, Shannon entropy and mutual information, for measuring internal and forced variability in ocean models. These metrics are applied to spatially and temporally averaged data. The metrics delineate relative intrinsic to total variability in a wider range of circumstances than previous approaches based on variance ratios. The metrics are applied to (a) a synthetic ensemble of random vectors, (b) ocean component of a global climate (GFDL-ESM2M) large ensemble, (c) ensemble of a realistic coastal ocean model. The information theory metric qualitatively agrees with the variance-based metric and possibly identifies regions of nonlinear correlations. In application (2)-the climate ensemble-the information theory metric detects higher temperature intrinsic variability in the Arctic region compared to the variance metric illustrating that the former is robust in a skewed probability distribution (Arctic sea surface temperature) resulting from sharply nonlinear behavior (freezing point). In application (3)-coastal ensemble-variability is dominated by external forcing. Using different selective forcing ensembles, we quantify the sensitivity of the coastal model to different types of external forcing: variations in the river runoff and changes in wind product do not add information (i.e., variability) during summer. Information theory enables ranking how much each forcing type contributes across multiple variables.
   It is important in models to distinguish variability caused by external forces versus variability that arises within the system. Within the ocean component of a climate model, disturbances from the atmosphere such as wind, solar heating and cooling, and anthropogenic emissions are external disturbances and variations due to swirling motions (eddies) are internal chaotic disturbances. We use statistical concepts to quantify the amount of variations in these models. Here, we study multiple simulations made using a coastal ocean model and a climate model. We find that measuring internal and external variability depends on the statistical method you choose. Some statistical methods make a priori assumptions about the data, some do not. Choosing the method that makes less assumptions is better for estimating variability, particularly when considering temperature in the Arctic and salinity in an estuary. We show that for the estuarine model simulations with altered forcings, analyzing the experiments with statistical methods that use fewer assumptions about the underlying data helps prioritize parts of the design of a forecast model.
   We use metrics from information theory to estimate intrinsic and extrinsic variability in ensemble global and coastal model In the Arctic region, metric reveals high intrinsic variability and low to moderate extrinsic forcing for temperature In the coastal model experiments with altered forcings, metrics quantified their effects on temperature and salinity for forecasting application

AB For transportation hubs, leveraging pedestrian flows for commercial activities presents an effective strategy for funding maintenance and infrastructure improvements. However, this introduces new challenges, as consumer behaviors can disrupt pedestrian flow and efficiency. To optimize both retail potential and pedestrian efficiency, careful strategic planning in store layout and facility dimensions was done by expert judgement due to the complexity in pedestrian dynamics in the retail areas of transportation hubs. This paper introduces an attention -based movement model to simulate these dynamics. By simulating retail potential of an area through the duration of visual attention it receives, and pedestrian efficiency via speed loss in pedestrian walking behaviors, the study further explores how design features can influence the retail potential and pedestrian efficiency in a bi-directional corridor inside a transportation hub.

AB Ion-containing polymers are subject to a wide range of hydration conditions across electrochemical and water treatment applications. Significant work on dry polymer electrolytes for batteries and highly swollen membranes for water purification has informed our understanding of ion transport under extreme conditions. However, knowledge of intermediate conditions (i.e., low hydration) is essential to emerging applications (e.g., electrolyzers, fuel cells, and lithium extraction). Ion transport under low levels of hydration is distinct from the extreme conditions typically investigated, and the relevant physics cannot be extrapolated from existing knowledge, stifling materials design. In this study, we conducted ion transport measurements in LiTFSI-doped polyethers that were systematically hydrated from dry conditions. A semiautomated apparatus that performs parallel measurements of water uptake and ionic conductivity in thin-film polymers under controlled humidity was developed. For the materials and swelling range considered in this study (i.e., <0.07 g water/g dry polymer electrolyte), ionic conductivity depends nonlinearly on water uptake, with the initial sorbed water weakly affecting conductivity. With additional increases in swelling, more significant increases in conductivity were observed. Remarkably, changes in conductivity induced by water sorption were correlated with the number of water molecules per lithium ion, with the normalized molar conductivity of different samples effectively collapsing onto one another until this unit of hydration exceeded the solvation number of lithium ions under aqueous conditions. These results provide important knowledge regarding the effects of trace water contamination on conductivity measurements in polymer electrolytes and demonstrate that the lithium-ion solvation number marks a key transition point regarding the influence of water on ion transport in ion-containing polymers.

AB Recently, the demand for MXene sheets in energy storage applications has been flourishing due to their unique functionalities, geometry, and enormous surface area. This report presents the hydrothermal-assisted fabrication of the promising electroactive materials Bi2WO6 (BW) and silver-doped bismuth tungstate Ag-Bi2WO6 (ABW). Integration of MXene into Ag doped Bi2WO6 (ABW@MXene) was carried out using an ultrasonication route to yield a hybrid electrode material for next-generation supercapacitor applications. The prepared electroactive samples were analyzed through physico-chemical techniques. The application study was performed using electrochemical measurements including cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Specific capacitance (Csp) values of ABW@MXene determined through CV and GCD were found to be 870 Fg-1 and 1420 Fg-1, respectively. ABW@MXene exhibited a long discharge time (426 s). Electrochemical measurements of pure MXene have been evaluated to demonstrate the synergy between ABW and MXene. Csp values of MXene from CV and GCD measurements were found to be 200 Fg-1 and 413 Fg-1 respectively. The enhanced Csp of ABW@MXene is due to the presence of MXene which provides channels for the facile transport of electrons. The solution resistance value for ABW@MXene was observed to be 0.69 ohm using EIS analysis, which is appropriate for the facile conductivity of electroactive species.Graphical AbstractBi2WO6, Ag-Bi2WO6 and Ag-Bi2WO6@MXene composite prepared via facile routes have been evaluated as electrode materials for supercapacitor fabrication. The Ag-Bi2WO6@MXene composite exhibited excellent specific capacitance 1420 Fg.-1
   Hydrothermal acid free fabrication of silver doped Bi2WO6 is presented.MXene integrated ABW nanocomposite was fabricated.ABW@MXene exhibited outstanding specific capacitance of 1420 F/g.MXene integration is the major contributor for enhanced Csp.

AB In the pursuit of advancing and diversifying energy technologies for a more sustainable future, the possibilities of hydrogen (H-2) usage will broaden, as will our understanding of its containment materials. Polyethylene (PE) has a vast assortment of uses and applications, which are growing with demands for alternative energy possibilities. One use of PE liner is as a prime candidate for nonmetallic piping and pressurized type IV storage devices. Such applications require PE to effectively prevent H-2 transport through containment systems. To study the molecular transport mechanism of hydrogen through polymeric barriers, a system containing hydrogen molecules absorbed within amorphous PE is modeled here using molecular dynamics simulations. The simulations are conducted within a range of temperatures that span the glass transition temperature of amorphous PE. The simulated PE displays bulk density, radius of gyration, and self-diffusion coefficient that are consistent with experimental data. The simulated trajectories are interrogated to study the movement of the guest gas molecules. The results show that the diffusion coefficients increase with temperature, as expected. However, the mobility of the PE chains is found to affect the mobility of absorbed H-2 molecules to a much lower extent than it affects that of CH4 molecules because of the much smaller size of the former than of the latter guest. From a molecular perspective, a "hopping" mechanism is observed, according to which H-2 molecules hop between one vacant free volume space to another within the polymer matrix, in combination with longer, straight, undisturbed "jumps" or "skips" along directions aligned with regions of ordered PE chains. This suggests that the orientation of the crystallites within the semicrystalline PE matrix affects the H-2 containment. Implications of these findings toward PE usage as containment material are discussed.

AB Phase-pure samples and single crystals of the rare-earth oxyselenides RE4Ga2Se7O2 (RE = Pr, Nd) were prepared by reactions at 950 degrees C. They adopt a new structure type (orthorhombic, space group Pnma, a = 11.721(2)-11.683(2) & Aring;, b = 3.9882(7)-3.9667(7) & Aring;, c = 29.644(5)-29.581(5) & Aring;, Z = 4) consisting of RESe6 trigonal prisms, GaSe4 tetrahedra, and GaSe5 trigonal bipyramids linked to form corrugated layers between which strips of edge-sharing RE4O tetrahedra are inserted. The bonding character is mostly ionic within RE-O and RE-Se blocks but mostly covalent with Ga-Se blocks, as supported by electronic structure calculations. Both compounds show a nearly direct optical band gap of 1.7 eV. Their Seebeck coefficients and electrical conductivities are predicted to be similar to other oxychalcogenides, with the thermoelectric power factors being improved by n-doping. They exhibit high electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction, with the Pr member demonstrating superior activity, as characterized by a low overpotential of 257 mV (at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)), a high mass activity of 70.1 A g(-1), and a turnover frequency of 0.0234 s(-1) in 1 M KOH electrolyte.

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS

ID PARTICLES
AB While the collective motion of active particles has been studied extensively, effective strategies to navigate particle swarms without external guidance remain elusive. We introduce a method to control the trajectories of two-dimensional swarms of active rod-like particles by confining the particles to rigid bounding membranes (vesicles) with non-uniform curvature. We show that the propelling agents spontaneously form clusters at the membrane wall and collectively propel the vesicle, turning it into an active superstructure. To further guide the motion of the superstructure, we add discontinuous features to the rigid membrane boundary in the form of a kinked tip, which acts as a steering component to direct the motion of the vesicle. We report that the system's geometrical and material properties, such as the aspect ratio and Peclet number of the active rods as well as the kink angle and flexibility of the membrane, determine the stacking of active particles close to the kinked confinement and induce a diverse set of dynamical behaviors of the superstructure, including linear and circular motion both in the direction of, and opposite to, the kink. From a systematic study of these various behaviors, we design vesicles with switchable and reversible locomotions by tuning the confinement parameters. The observed phenomena suggest a promising mechanism for particle transportation and could be used as a basic element to navigate active matter through complex and tortuous environments.

   heterogeneity
AB Federated learning (FL) embraces the concepts of targeted data gathering and training, and it can reduce many of the systemic privacy costs and hazards associated with traditional machine learning frameworks. However, on the one hand, the wireless communication propagation circumstances and client computation capabilities are not taken into account in traditional synchronous FL algorithms, which causes the time delay in the FL process because the time of each round is determined by the client with the worst performance. On the other hand, the unfairness of client participation in FL may lead to damage to the global accuracy because of the non identically independently distributed (Non-IID) data. In this paper, we propose a Stackelberg game-based FL Client Selection framework, named FedSCS, which considers system heterogeneity, client heterogeneity, and the fairness of client participation to reduce the latency resulting from the heterogeneous communication conditions and computation capabilities among clients with Non-IID data distributions. Specifically, the Stackelberg leader-follower game is first formulated in which the server decides the price of the single quota of participating in the FL process every communication round and the clients decide whether to participate in FL. Then the equilibrium solution of the game is derived and proved. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy for reducing the time latency of FL processes with heterogeneous clients, i.e., FedAvg, FedOpt, and FedNova.

AB The synthesis of copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) was accomplished by using a rapid, green, and versatile argon plasma reduction method that involves solvent extraction. With this method, a plasma-solid state interaction forms and CuNPs can be synthesized from copper(II) sulfate using a low-pressure, low-temperature argon plasma. Characterization studies of the CuNPs revealed that when a metal precursor is treated under optimal experimental conditions of 80 W of argon plasma for 300 s, brown CuNPs are synthesized. However, when those same brown CuNPs are placed in Milli-Q water for a period of 10 days, oxidation occurs and green CuNPs are formed. Confirmation of the chemical identity of the CuNPs was performed by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results reveal that the brown CuNPs are predominantly Cu-0 or what we refer to as CuNPs, while the green CuNPs are a mixture of Cu-0 and Cu(OH)(2) NPs. Upon further characterization of both brown and green CuNPs with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the results depict brown CuNPs with a rod-like shape and approximate dimensions of 40 nm x 160 nm, while the green CuNPs were smaller in size, with dimensions of 40-80 nm, and more of a round shape. When testing the antibacterial activity of both brown and green CuNPs, our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of both CuNPs against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus bacteria at a concentration of 17 mu g/mL. The inactivation of S. aureus and E. coli 7-day-old biofilms required CuNP concentrations of 99 mu g/mL. SEM images of treated 7-day-old S. aureus and E. coli biofilms depict cell membranes that are completely damaged, suggesting a physical killing mechanism. In addition, when the same concentration of CuNPs used to inactivate biofilms were tested with human fibroblasts, both brown and green CuNPs were found to be biocompatible.

AB Segregation engineering has emerged as a promising pathway towards designing thermally stable nanocrystalline alloys with enhanced mechanical properties. However, the compositional and processing space for solute stabilized microstructures is vast, thus the application of high-throughput techniques to accelerate optimal material development is increasingly attractive. In this work, combinatorial synthesis is combined with high-throughput characterization techniques to explore microstructural transitions through annealing of a nanocrystalline ternary Al-base alloy containing a transition metal (TM=Ni) and rare earth dopant (RE=Y). A down-selected optimal composition with the highest thermal stability is annealed through in situ transmission electron microscopy, revealing that the removal of the RE species is correlated to a reduction in the microstructural stability at high temperatures as a result of variations in intermetallic phase formation. Results demonstrate the benefits of cosegregation for enhancing mechanical hardness and delaying the onset of microstructural instability.

AB The past 50 years of interdisciplinary research in humans and model organisms has delivered unprecedented insights into the mechanisms through which diet affects energy balance. However, translating these results to prevent and treat obesity and its associated diseases remains challenging. Given the vast scope of this literature, we focus this Review on recent conceptual advances in molecular nutrition targeting the management of energy balance, including emerging dietary and pharmaceutical interventions and their interactions with the human gut microbiome. Notably, multiple current dietary patterns of interest embrace moderate-to- high fat intake or prioritize the timing of eating over macronutrient intake. Furthermore, the rapid expansion of microbiome research findings has complicated multiple longstanding tenets of nutrition while also providing new opportunities for intervention. Continued progress promises more precise and reliable dietary recommendations that leverage our growing knowledge of the microbiome, the changing landscape of clinical interventions, and our molecular understanding of human biology.

AB Proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) is a fundamental process involved in all areas of chemistry, with relevance to biological transformations, catalysis, and emergent energy storage and conversion technologies. Early observations of PCET were reported by Meyer and co-workers in 1981 while investigating the proton dependence of reduction of a molecular ruthenium oxo complex. Since that time, this conceptual framework has grown to encompass an enormous scope of charge transfer and compensation reactions. In this Account, we will discuss ongoing efforts in the Matson Laboratory to understand the fundamental thermodynamics and kinetics of PCET processes at the surface of a series of Lindqvist-type polyoxovanadate clusters. This project aims to provide atomistic resolution of net H atom uptake and transfer at the surfaces of transition-metal oxide materials. First, we discuss our efforts aimed at understanding PCET at metal oxide surfaces using the Lindqvist-type polyoxovanadate-alkoxide (POV-alkoxide) cluster [nBu4N]2[V6O13(TRIOLNO2)2]. These clusters reversibly bind H atom equivalents at bridging oxide sites, mirroring the proposed uptake and release of e-/H+ pairs at transition-metal oxide surfaces. Summarized results include the measurement of bond dissociation free energies of surface hydroxide moieties (BDFE(O-H)) as well as mechanistic analyses that verify concerted proton electron transfer as the operative pathway for PCET at the surface of POV-alkoxide clusters. Next, we discuss net proton and H atom uptake at the surface of reduced variants of the Lindqvist-type POV-alkoxide cluster, [V6O7(OR)12]n (R = Me, Et; n = -2, -1, 0, + 1). In the case of these low-valent POV-alkoxide clusters, nucleophilic bridging sites are kinetically inhibited by functionalization of the cluster surface with organic ligands. This molecular modification enables siteselectivity in proton and H atom uptake to terminal oxide sites. The impact of reaction site and cluster electronics on reaction driving force of PCET is explored, with core electron density playing a critical role in dictating thermodynamics of H atom uptake and transfer. Additional work described here contrasts the kinetics of PCET at terminal oxide sites to the reactivity observed at bridging oxides in POV-alkoxide clusters. Overall, this Account summarizes our foundational knowledge regarding the assessment of PCET reactivity at the surfaces of molecular metal oxides. Drawing analogies between POV-alkoxide clusters and nanoscopic metal oxide materials provide design principles for the advancement of materials applications with atomic precision. These complexes are additionally highlighted as tunable redox mediators in their own right; our studies demonstrate how cluster surface reactivities can be optimized by modifying electronic structure and surface functionalities.

AB Flavonoids show abundant favorable physicochemical and drug related properties, leading to substantial biological applications which are limited by undesirable properties such as poor solubility, high polarity, low bioavailability, and enzymatic degradations. Chemical modification with bioisosteres can be used to address some of these challenges. We report the synthesis and characterization of partial flavonoid acetamide derivatives from quercetin, apigenin and luteolin and the evaluation of their structure-activity relationships based on antioxidant, bioavailability, drug likeness, and toxicity properties. The sequential synthesis was achieved with 76.67-87.23% yield; the structures of the compounds were confirmed using H-1 & C-13 NMR characterizations. The purity of each compound was determined by HPLC while the molecular weights were determined by mass spectrometry. The % bioavailability was determined using the dialysis tubing procedure and the values were in the range 15.97-38.12%. The antioxidant activity was determined by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay and expressed as the IC50 values which were in the range 31.52-198.41 mu M. The drug likeness and the toxicity properties of compounds 4, 5, 7, 11 and 15 were predicted using computational tools and showed satisfactory results. A structure-activity relationship evaluation reveals that hydroxyl and methylene groups attached on the 2-phenylchromen-4-one structure of the flavonoid play a colossal role in the overall antioxidant and bioavailability properties. The improved bioavailability and excellent drug relevance and toxicity properties present flavonoid acetamide derivatives as prospective drug candidates for further evaluations.

AB The low earth orbit (LEO) satellite network is regarded as a promising technology for delivering seamless service to remote areas such as rural areas. In this paper, we consider a dynamic data offloading problem in ultra-dense LEO satellites networks with large-scale ground users, where each ground user makes the distributed offloading decision based on its state information, the influence from other ground users, and the fees paid to satellites. To investigate the interaction problem between ground users and satellites, we formulate the problem as a Stackelberg game. Specifically, the satellites serve as the leaders, who decide the data service price at each time slot. The ground users, on the contrary, are the followers who decide the power control based on their states, the influence from other ground users and the fees paid to satellites. Since the influence is difficult to estimate due to the large number of ground users, we employ the mean field game algorithm to transform the influence from others and satellites into the mean field term, and reformulate the optimization problem as a Stackelberg mean field game (SMFG). Each ground user makes the data offloading decision by learning the future impact of the whole network distributively. For ground users, we solve the power control optimization problem by utilizing the G-prox primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) algorithm, where the Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov (FPK) equation is converted into a linear form via the Taylor expansion. For satellites, we address the service pricing optimization problem by using the adjoint algorithm. Finally, the numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

AB Developing a molecular-level understanding of the properties of water is central to numerous scientific and technological applications. However, accurately modeling water through computer simulations has been a significant challenge due to the complex nature of the hydrogen-bonding network that water molecules form under different thermodynamic conditions. This complexity has led to over five decades of research and many modeling attempts. The introduction of the MB-pol data-driven many-body potential energy function marked a significant advancement toward a universal molecular model capable of predicting the structural, thermodynamic, dynamical, and spectroscopic properties of water across all phases. By integrating physics-based and data-driven (i.e., machine-learned) components, which correctly capture the delicate balance among different many-body interactions, MB-pol achieves chemical and spectroscopic accuracy, enabling realistic molecular simulations of water, from gas-phase clusters to liquid water and ice. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of the data-driven many-body formalism adopted by MB-pol, highlight the main results and predictions made from computer simulations with MB-pol to date, and discuss the prospects for future extensions to data-driven many-body potentials of generic and reactive molecular systems.

AB Bacterial extracellular vesicles (BEVs), including outer membrane vesicles, have emerged as a promising new class of vaccines and therapeutics to treat cancer and inflammatory diseases, among other applications. However, clinical translation of BEVs is hindered by a current lack of scalable and efficient purification methods. Here, we address downstream BEV biomanufacturing limitations by developing a method for orthogonal size- and charge-based BEV enrichment using tangential flow filtration (TFF) in tandem with high performance anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC). The data show that size-based separation coisolated protein contaminants, whereas size-based TFF with charged-based HPAEC dramatically improved purity of BEVs produced by probiotic Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Gram-positive lactic acid bacteria (LAB). Escherichia coli BEV purity was quantified using established biochemical markers while improved LAB BEV purity was assessed via observed potentiation of anti-inflammatory bioactivity. Overall, this work establishes orthogonal TFF + HPAEC as a scalable and efficient method for BEV purification that holds promise for future large-scale biomanufacturing of therapeutic BEV products.

AB Solid-state polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are increasingly favored over liquid electrolytes for emerging energy storage devices due to their safety features, enhanced stability, and multifunctionality. Minor solvents (such as water) are often introduced unintentionally or intentionally into SPEs. Although it can significantly affect SPEs' electrochemical and mechanical properties, the fundamental role of such solvent content has rarely been studied. Here, we investigate the effects of minor water content on two representative SPEs through molecular dynamics simulations. Focusing on SPEs composed of different base polymers, namely, poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and poly(lactic acid) (PLA), and the same salt, lithium perchlorate (LiClO4), our simulations reveal that slight hydration facilitates an increase in ionic conductivity while preserving the mechanical integrity of the SPEs. Notably, these water contents appear to affect ionic conductivity more effectively in certain systems than others, which is attributed to the unique interactions among ions, water, and the polymer matrix. Moreover, small amounts of water can maintain the stiffness of SPEs rather than reducing it. Such results suggest a facile approach to developing SPEs with balanced ionic conductivity and mechanical properties, suitable for a range of energy storage applications.

AB Prediction of organismal viability upon exposure to a nanoparticle in varying environments & horbar;as fully specified at the molecular scale & horbar;has emerged as a useful figure of merit in the design of engineered nanoparticles. We build on our earlier finding that a bag of artificial neural networks (ANNs) can provide such a prediction when such machines are trained with a relatively small data set (with ca. 200 examples). Therein, viabilities were predicted by consensus using the weighted means of the predictions from the bags. Here, we confirm the accuracy and precision of the prediction of nanoparticle viabilities using an optimized bag of ANNs over sets of data examples that had not previously been used in the training and validation process. We also introduce the viability strip, rather than a single value, as the prediction and construct it from the viability probability distribution of an ensemble of ANNs compatible with the data set. Specifically, the ensemble consists of the ANNs arising from subsets of the data set corresponding to different splittings between training and validation, and the different bags (k-folds). A k-1/k machine uses a single partition (or bag) of k - 1 ANNs each trained on 1/k of the data to obtain a consensus prediction, and a k-bag machine quorum samples the k possible k-1/k machines available for a given partition. We find that with increasing k in the k-bag or k-1/k machines, the viability strips become more normally distributed and their predictions become more precise. Benchmark comparisons between ensembles of 4-bag machines and 3434 fraction machines suggest that the 3434 fraction machine has similar accuracy while overcoming some of the challenges arising from divergent ANNs in the 4-bag machines.

AB Competitive sorption enables the emergent phenomenon of enhanced CO2-based selectivities for gas separation membranes when using microporous polymers with primary amines. However, strong secondary forces in these polymers through hydrogen bonding results in low solvent solubility, precluding standard solution processing approaches to form these polymers into membrane films. Herein, we circumvent these manufacturing constraints while maintaining competitive-sorption enhancements by synthesizing eight representative microporous poly(arylene ether)s (PAEs) with tertiary amines. High-pressure H2S, CO2, and CH4 sorption isotherms were collected for these samples to demonstrate enhanced affinity for acid gases relative to the unfunctional control polymer. Although competitive sorption was observed for all samples, improvements were less pronounced than for primary-amine-functional analogs. For H2S-based separations, the benefits of competitive sorption offset decreases in selectivity due to plasticization. This detailed study helps to elucidate the role of tertiary amines for acid gas separations in solution-processable microporous PAEs.

AB Experimental noise often contains information about the interactions of a system with its environment, but establishing a relation between the measured time fluctuations and the underlying physical observables is rarely apparent. Here, we leverage a multidimensional and multisensor analysis of spectral diffusion to investigate the dynamics of trapped carriers near subdiffraction clusters of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. We establish statistical correlations in the spectral fluctuations we measure as we recursively probe the cluster optical resonances, which we then exploit to reveal proximal traps. Further, we deterministically induce Stark shifts in the cluster spectrum, ultimately allowing us to pinpoint the relative three-dimensional positions of interacting NVs as well as the location and charge sign of surrounding traps. Our results can be generalized to other color centers and provide opportunities for the characterization of photocarrier dynamics in semiconductors and the manipulation of nanoscale spin-qubit clusters connected via electric fields.

AB Absolute cross sections measured using electromagnetic devices to separate and detect heavy recoiling ions need to be corrected for charge state fractions. Accurate prediction of charge state distributions using theoretical models is not always a possibility, especially in energy and mass regions where data is sparse. As such, it is often necessary to measure charge state fractions directly. In this paper we present a novel method of using a scintillation screen along with a CMOS camera to image the charge dispersed beam after a set of magnetic dipoles. A measurement of the charge state distribution for 88Sr passing through a natural carbon foil is performed. Using a Bayesian model to extract statistically meaningful uncertainties from these images, we find agreement between the new method and a more traditional method using Faraday cups. Future work is need to better understand systematic uncertainties. Our technique offers a viable method to measure charge state distributions.

AB In this work, we developed a compositionally transferable machine learning interatomic potential using atomic cluster expansion potential and PBE-D3 method for (NaCl)(1-x)(MgCl2)(x) molten salt and we showed that it is possible to fit a robust potential for this pseudo-binary system by only including data from x={0, 1/3, 2/3, 1}. We also assessed the performance of several DFT methods including PBE-D3, PBE-D4, R2SCAN-D4, and R2SCAN-rVV10 on unary NaCl and MgCl2 salts. Our results show that the R2SCAN-D4 method calculates the thermophysical properties of NaCl and MgCl2 with an overall modestly better accuracy compared to the other three methods.

TI ReLMM: Reinforcement Learning Optimizes Feature Selection in Modeling

SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING
LA English
DT Article
AB A challenge to materials discovery is the identification of the physical features that are most correlated to a given target material property without redundancy. Such variables necessarily comprise the optimal search domain in subsequent material design. Here, we introduce a reinforcement learning-based material model (ReLMM) as a tool for analyzing a given database in identifying a minimal or near minimal subset of physical features for the design of a material with a given target property. We aim for minimality in the selected subset with respect to its size-smaller being better- while maintaining the desired accuracy of the prediction. We have shown, using synthetic multiscale data sets, that ReLMM can identify the relative importance of features, and thus help identify which should be selected across scales. In the context of semiconducting materials, ReLMM can be used to improve the prediction of the band gap by identifying which features should be selected in model building. For metal halide perovskites, ReLMM was seen to find a near minimal data set at least as well as, if not better than, state-of-the-art feature selection tools such as LASSO and XGBoost. We also found that our domain-science oriented approach can be used to uncover the hierarchical structure of a material from a database consisting of molecular-scale, mesoscale and device-scale features and labels in complementarity with an earlier hierarchical model called NestedAE.

AB Introduction: Molecular communication is the transfer of information encoded by molecular structure and activity. We examine molecular communication within bacterial consortia as cells with diverse biosynthetic capabilities can be assembled for enhanced function. Their coordination, both in terms of engineered genetic circuits within individual cells as well as their population-scale functions, is needed to ensure robust performance. We have suggested that "electrogenetics," the use of electronics to activate specific genetic circuits, is a means by which electronic devices can mediate molecular communication, ultimately enabling programmable control.Methods: Here, we have developed a graphical network model for dynamically assessing electronic and molecular signal propagation schemes wherein nodes represent individual cells, and their edges represent communication channels by which signaling molecules are transferred. We utilize graph properties such as edge dynamics and graph topology to interrogate the signaling dynamics of specific engineered bacterial consortia.Results: We were able to recapitulate previous experimental systems with our model. In addition, we found that networks with more distinct subpopulations (high network modularity) propagated signals more slowly than randomized networks, while strategic arrangement of subpopulations with respect to the inducer source (an electrode) can increase signal output and outperform otherwise homogeneous networks.Discussion: We developed this model to better understand our previous experimental results, but also to enable future designs wherein subpopulation composition, genetic circuits, and spatial configurations can be varied to tune performance. We suggest that this work may provide insight into the signaling which occurs in synthetically assembled systems as well as native microbial communities.

DT Editorial Material
ID INCOME
AB Recent arguments claim that behavioral science has focused - to its detriment - on the individual over the system when construing behavioral interventions. In this commentary, we argue that tackling economic inequality using both framings in tandem is invaluable. By studying individuals who have overcome inequality, "positive deviants," and the system limitations they navigate, we offer potentially greater policy solutions.

AB Host response to environmental exposures such as pathogens and chemicals can include modifications to the epigenome and transcriptome. Improved signature discovery, including the identification of the agent and timing of exposure, has been enabled by advancements in assaying techniques to detect RNA expression, DNA base modifications, histone modifications, and chromatin accessibility. The interrogation of the epigenome and transcriptome cascade requires analyzing disparate datasets from multiple assay types, often at single-cell resolution, derived from the same biospecimen. However, there remains a paucity of rigorous quality control standards of those datasets that reflect quality assurance of the underlying assay. This guide outlines a comprehensive suite of metrics that can be used to ensure quality from 11 different epigenetics and transcriptomics assays. Recommended mitigative actions to address failed metrics are provided. The workflow presented aims to improve benchwork protocols and dataset quality to enable accurate discovery of exposure signatures.

AB The energetic disorder induced by fluctuating liquid environments acts in opposition to the precise control required for coherence-based sensing. Overcoming fluctuations requires a protected quantum subspace that only weakly interacts with the local environment. We report a ytterbium complex that exhibited an ultranarrow absorption linewidth in solution at room temperature with a full width at half maximum of 0.625 milli-electron volts. Using spectral hole burning, we measured an even narrower linewidth of 410 pico-electron volts at 77 kelvin. Narrow linewidths allowed low-field magnetic circular dichroism at room temperature, used to sense Earth-scale magnetic fields. These results demonstrated that ligand protection in lanthanide complexes could substantially diminish electronic state fluctuations. We have termed this system an "atomlike molecular sensor" (ALMS) and proposed approaches to improve its performance.

ID ALLOYS
AB Controllable and reliable doping of cubic boron nitride (cBN) is a critical challenge in its widespread application in power electronics. Recently, progress was made in this regard when an experiment reported successful n-doping of cBN with carbon, reaching carbon concentrations as high as 5%, which is beyond the thermodynamic solubility limit. However, the nature of carbon based defects introduced within the cBN matrix remains unknown thus far. Here, we explore the electronic structure of carbon doped cBN under nitrogen-rich conditions, which are conducive to the formation of donor-type defects (such as carbon substituents replacing boron), and predict several possible arrangements of carbon in clusters at experimentally relevant concentrations of 1.5-7.8%. Our theoretical calculations show that carbon dopants prefer to aggregate into small clusters with local ordering rather than distributing randomly in the bulk. Along with defects that result in easily ionizable defect states, we also report a distribution of carbon dopants, where the structure exhibits a defect-bound small electron polaron. The polaron can be identified via a split-off localized dopant band near the valence band edge. These findings not only shed light on identities of possible carbon-based defects but also predict additional carriers-defect-bound small polarons.

AB Across development, experience has a strong impact on the way we think and adapt. School experience affects academic and social-emotional outcomes, yet whether differences in pedagogical experience modulate underlying brain network development is still unknown. In this study, we compared the brain network dynamics of students with different pedagogical backgrounds. Specifically, we characterized the diversity and stability of brain activity at rest by combining both resting-state fMRI and diffusion-weighted structural imaging data of 87 4-18 years old students experiencing either the Montessori pedagogy (i.e., student-led, trial-and-error pedagogy) or the traditional pedagogy (i.e., teacher-led, test-based pedagogy). Our results revealed spatiotemporal brain dynamics differences between students as a function of schooling experience at the whole-brain level. Students from Montessori schools showed overall higher functional integration (higher system diversity) and neural stability (lower spatiotemporal diversity) compared to traditionally schooled students. Higher integration was explained mainly through the cerebellar (CBL) functional network. In contrast, higher temporal stability was observed in the ventral attention, dorsal attention, somatomotor, frontoparietal, and CBL functional networks. This study suggests a form of experience-dependent dynamic functional connectivity plasticity, in learning-related networks.

TI Alkene Isomerization Using a Heterogeneous Nickel-Hydride Catalyst

AB Transition metal-catalyzed alkene isomerization is an enabling technology used to install an alkene distal to its original site. Due to their well-defined structure, homogeneous catalysts can be fine-tuned to optimize reactivity, stereoselectivity, and positional selectivity, but they often suffer from instability and nonrecyclability. Heterogeneous catalysts are generally highly robust but continue to lack active-site specificity and are challenging to rationally improve through structural modification. Known single-site heterogeneous catalysts for alkene isomerization utilize precious metals and bespoke, expensive, and synthetically intense supports. Additionally, they generally have mediocre reactivity, inspiring us to develop a heterogeneous catalyst with an active site made from readily available compounds made of Earth-abundant elements. Previous work demonstrated that a very active homogeneous catalyst is formed upon protonation of Ni[P(OEt)(3)](4) by H2SO4, generating a [Ni-H](+) active site. This catalyst is incredibly active, but also decomposes readily, which severely limits its utility. Herein we show that by using a solid acid (sulfated zirconia, SZO(300)), not only is this decomposition prevented, but high activity is maintained, improved selectivity is achieved, and a broader scope of functional groups is tolerated. Preliminary mechanistic experiments suggest that the catalytic reaction likely goes through an intermolecular, two-electron pathway. A detailed kinetic study comparing the state-of-the-art Ni and Pd isomerization catalysts reveals that the highest activity and selectivity is seen with the Ni/SZO(300) system. The reactivity of Ni/SZO(300), is not limited to alkene isomerization; it is also a competent catalyst for hydroalkenylation, hydroboration, and hydrosilylation, demonstrating the broad application of this heterogeneous catalyst.

AB The analysis of strings of n random variables with geometric distribution has recently attracted renewed interest: Archibald et al. consider the number of distinct adjacent pairs in geometrically distributed words. They obtain the asymptotic (n -> infinity) mean of this number in the cases of different and identical pairs. In this paper we are interested in all asymptotic moments in the identical case, in the asymptotic variance in the different case and in the asymptotic distribution in both cases. We use two approaches: the first one, the probabilistic approach, leads to variances in both cases and to some conjectures on all moments in the identical case and on the distribution in both cases. The second approach, the combinatorial one, relies on multivariate pattern matching techniques, yielding exact formulas for first and second moments. We use such tools as Mellin transforms, Analytic Combinatorics, Markov Chains.

AB Perimeter control is a traffic management approach aimed at regulating vehicular accumulation within urban regional networks by managing flows on all border-crossing roads. Methods based on the macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) fall short in providing specific metering for individual roads. Recent advancements in the cell transmission model (CTM) have attempted to address this limitation but are hindered by their reliance on centralized control, which requires the availability of full information and authority over traffic generation sites. Our study proposes an innovative decentralized, game-theoretical framework for perimeter control to address these practical challenges. It is structured around two key groups of agents: perimeter agents, tasked with managing border roads, and interior agents, focused on traffic within generation sites. The framework also incorporates mechanisms for interactions between these agents and the road network, aiming to optimize their individual utilities. Additionally, we have developed a multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, extending the mean-field theory concept, to address the complexity of simultaneous learning by multiple agents.

AB To better understand spawning vocalizations of Norwegian coastal cod (Gadus morhua), a prototype eight-element coherent hydrophone array was deployed in stationary vertical and towed horizontal modes to monitor cod sounds during an experiment in spring 2019. Depth distribution of cod aggregations was monitored concurrently with an ultrasonic echosounder. Cod vocalizations recorded on the hydrophone array are analysed to provide time-frequency characteristics, and source level distribution after correcting for one-way transmission losses from cod locations to the hydrophone array. The recorded cod vocalization frequencies range from & SIM;20 to 600 Hz with a peak power frequency of & SIM;60 Hz, average duration of 300 ms, and mean source level of 163.5 & PLUSMN; 7.9 dB re 1 & mu;Pa at 1 m. Spatial dependence of received cod vocalization rates is estimated using hydrophone array measurements as the array is towed horizontally from deeper surrounding waters to shallow water inlet areas of the experimental site. The bathymetric-dependent probability of detection regions for cod vocalizations are quantified and are found to be significantly reduced in shallow-water areas of the inlet. We show that the towable hydrophone array deployed from a moving vessel is invaluable because it can survey cod vocalization activity at multiple locations, providing continuous spatial coverage that is complementary to fixed sensor systems that provide continuous temporal coverage at a given location.

AB Magnetic fields and their dynamical interplay with matter in galaxy clusters contribute to the physical properties and evolution of the intracluster medium. However, the current understanding of the origin and properties of cluster magnetic fields is still limited by observational challenges. In this article, we map the magnetic fields at hundreds-kpc scales of five clusters RXC J1314.4-2515, Abell 2345, Abell 3376, MCXC J0352.4-7401, and El Gordo using the synchrotron intensity gradient technique in conjunction with high-resolution radio observations from the Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) and the Karoo Array Telescope (MeerKAT). We demonstrate that the magnetic field orientation of radio relics derived from synchrotron intensity gradient is in agreement with that obtained with synchrotron polarization. Most importantly, the synchrotron intensity gradient is not limited by Faraday depolarization in the cluster central regions and allows us to map magnetic fields in the radio halos of RXC J1314.4-2515 and El Gordo. We find that magnetic fields in radio halos exhibit a preferential direction along the major merger axis and show turbulent structures at higher angular resolution. The results are consistent with expectations from numerical simulations, which predict turbulent magnetic fields in cluster mergers that are stirred and amplified by matter motions.
   The current understanding of the origin and properties of cluster magnetic fields is limited by observational challenges. Here, the authors show that magnetic field orientations of galaxy clusters, including radio relic and radio halos, can be derived via combination of synchrotron intensity gradient technique with radio observations.

AB A standard interpretation of the intensification of segregation in the early twentieth century is that residents of Northern cities reacted against a growing African American presence, using segregation as a tool of social control that was less needed in the South. Evidence from newly available data for 134 cities in 1900-1940 puts this interpretation in question in several ways. We find that segregation was already high in 1900 at the neighborhood scale. Not only was it rising, but it was changing its spatial scale as clusters of Black settlement in side streets and alleys disappeared from White districts while expanding into large Black zones. Finally, multivariate analyses show that trends were similar in the North and South, and in neither region was Black population size (i.e., "Black threat") a significant predictor of increasing segregation. The general trends of rising segregation and increasing spatial scale became a nationwide pattern.

AB Scenarios to stabilize global climate and meet international climate agreements require rapid reductions in human carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, often augmented by substantial carbon dioxide removal (CDR) from the atmosphere. While some ocean-based removal techniques show potential promise as part of a broader CDR and decarbonization portfolio, no marine approach is ready yet for deployment at scale because of gaps in both scientific and engineering knowledge. Marine CDR spans a wide range of biotic and abiotic methods, with both common and technique-specific limitations. Further targeted research is needed on CDR efficacy, permanence, and additionality as well as on robust validation methods-measurement, monitoring, reporting, and verification-that are essential to demonstrate the safe removal and long-term storage of CO2. Engineering studies are needed on constraints including scalability, costs, resource inputs, energy demands, and technical readiness. Research on possible co-benefits, ocean acidification effects, environmental and social impacts, and governance is also required.

TI Scarecrows in Oz: The Use of Large Language Models in HRI
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON HUMAN-ROBOT INTERACTION
LA English

DE Large Language Models; robot cognitive architectures; Robot Ethics
ID ROBOTS
AB The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents both a critical design challenge and a remarkable opportunity for the field of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). While the direct deployment of LLMs on interactive robots may be unsuitable for reasons of ethics, safety, and control, LLMs might nevertheless provide a promising baseline technique for many elements of HRI. Specifically, in this article, we argue for the use of LLMs as Scarecrows: "brainless," straw-man black-box modules integrated into robot architectures for the purpose of quickly enabling full-pipeline solutions, much like the use of "Wizard of Oz" (WoZ) and other human-in-the-loop approaches. We explicitly acknowledge that these Scarecrows, rather than providing a satisfying or scientifically complete solution, incorporate a form of the wisdom of the crowd and, in at least some cases, will ultimately need to be replaced or supplemented by a robust and theoretically motivated solution. We provide examples of how Scarecrows could be used in language-capable robot architectures as useful placeholders and suggest initial reporting guidelines for authors, mirroring existing guidelines for the use and reporting of WoZ techniques.

AB Thermal radiation has been extensively modeled in static particulate media with effective radiative properties or with statistical ray tracing techniques. However, these techniques are not directly compatible to evaluate radiative fluxes on discrete particles, which is more suitable for particle flow systems. This study focuses on such a discrete approach to compute radiative fluxes by developing view factors correlations for particle-particle and particle-wall. Training data is generated from physics-based Monte Carlo ray tracing simulations on a monodisperse, packed bed with solid volume fractions ranging from 0.016 to 0.45. This data was used to develop reduced-order correlations to determine particle-particle and particle-wall radiative view factors as a function of particle-particle and particle-wall separation distance, viewing angle, and the number of shading particles. Uniquely, we determine best-fit functions that are physically interpretable to account for shading effects by particles. A sigmoid function with a non-linear dependence on viewing angle governs the extent of shading by an intermediate particle. A correction factor with the particle-wall normal separation distance as the feature variable is introduced to account for shading effects between a particle and a planar wall surface. View factor correlations result in reliable and reasonably accurate predictions. For a solid volume fraction of 0.45, the root mean squared errors of particle-particle and particle-wall view factors are 2.7e-4 and 0.021 with corresponding training data in the ranges of 0-0.08 and 0-0.5 respectively. To scale these correlations for large number of particles, restricting shading detection up to 5 nearest neighbors is demonstrated to be an effective strategy to balance prediction accuracy with computational efficiency. With thousands of particles, the computational cost of proposed view factor correlations with thresholding of 5 shading particles is about 100 times faster than serial Monte Carlo ray tracing simulations for a solid volume fraction of 0.45.

AB Rare tautomeric forms of nucleobases can lead to Watson-Crick-like (WC-like) mispairs in DNA, but the process of proton transfer is fast and difficult to detect experimentally. NMR studies show evidence for the existence of short-time WC-like guanine-thymine (G-T) mispairs; however, the mechanism of proton transfer and the degree to which nuclear quantum effects play a role are unclear. We use a B-DNA helix exhibiting a wGT mispair as a model system to study tautomerization reactions. We perform ab initio (PBE0/6-31G*) quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) simulations to examine the free energy surface for tautomerization. We demonstrate that while the ab initio QM/MM simulations are accurate, considerable sampling is required to achieve high precision in the free energy barriers. To address this problem, we develop a QM/MM machine learning potential correction (QM/MM-Delta MLP) that is able to improve the computational efficiency, greatly extend the accessible time scales of the simulations, and enable practical application of path integral molecular dynamics to examine nuclear quantum effects. We find that the inclusion of nuclear quantum effects has only a modest effect on the mechanistic pathway but leads to a considerable lowering of the free energy barrier for the GT*(sic)G*T equilibrium. Our results enable a rationalization of observed experimental data and the prediction of populations of rare tautomeric forms of nucleobases and rates of their interconversion in B-DNA.

AB Herein, the execution of synthetic strategies solving scalability issues observed in the original route is reported, increasing the total yield by 50% compared to the previously disclosed synthesis. A notable restructuring of the route's initial steps to reach a common allylic alcohol intermediate employs a highly stereoselective epoxidation method and avoids superfluous protecting group manipulations while limiting dependence on kinetic resolution in establishing stereochemistry for four of the six chiral centers in (+)-desmethylxestospongin B. Different protecting group strategies to avoid problems with their subsequent removal were considered and enacted; to this end, material was retained as byproducts were suppressed. While the lactam semireduction under Birch conditions requires further investigation, the updated synthesis of (+)-desmethylxestospongin B reported here made it more scalable, affording 0.37 g of this natural product for continued biological studies.

AB Recently, we reported on the simple, scalable synthesis of quantum-confined one-dimensional (1D) lepidocrocite titanate nanofilaments (1DLs). Herein, we show, using solid-state UV-vis spectroscopy, that reducing the concentration of aqueous 1DL colloidal suspensions from 40 to 0.01 g/L increases the band gap energy and light absorption onset of dried filtered films from approximate to 3.5 to approximate to 4.5 eV. This range is ascribed to quantum confinement as the system transitions from two-dimensional (2D) into 1D with dilution. It is only after the colloidal suspensions are dried and the 1DLs start to self-assemble into ribbons and sheets that the band gap values change. This self-assembly is manifested in the X-ray diffraction patterns and the emergence of a Raman band characteristic of 2D lepidocrocite titanates. In colloidal form, 1DLs exhibit a lyotropic liquid crystal phase with a critical concentration of between 10 and 1 g/L. Additionally, the Beer-Lambert law applies with a mass absorbance coefficient of 2 +/- 0.4 Lg-1 cm-1. The optical absorbance edges of the colloidal suspensions are not a function of concentration. The experimental findings are theoretically supported by density functional theory calculations of the Raman vibrational modes and electronic band structures of the 1D and 2D lepidocrocite titanate atomic structures.

AB This paper presents Flame, a hardware/software co-designed resilience scheme for protecting GPUs against soft errors. For low-cost yet high-performance resilience, Flame uses acoustic sensors and idempotent processing for error detection and recovery, respectively. That is, Flame seeks to correct any sensor-detected errors by re-executing the idempotent region where they occurred. To achieve this, it is essential for each idempotent region to ensure the absence of errors before moving on to the next region. This is so-called soft error verification that takes sensors' worst-case detection latency (WCDL) to verify each region finished Rather than waiting for WCDL at each region end, which incurs too much performance overhead, Flame proposes WCDL-aware warp scheduling that can hide the error verification delay (i.e., WCDL) with GPU's inherent massive warp-level parallelism. When a warp hits each idempotent region boundary, Flame deschedules the warp and switches to one of the other ready warps-as if the region boundary were a regular long-latency operation triggering the warp switching. By leveraging GPU's inherent ability for the latency hiding, Flame can completely eliminate the verification delay without significant hardware modification. The experimental results demonstrate that the performance overhead of Flame is near zero, i.e., 0.6% on average for 34 GPU benchmark applications.

AB Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is an aggressive malignancy usually detectable at the advanced stage, with a 5-year survival rate of less than 8%. It has been reported that a gene called tumor-protein 63 (TP63) is expressed in an aggressive form of pancreatic cancer with a squamous signature. Thus, inhibiting the activity of p63 can be a means of treating and managing PDA. Different studies have shown that plant constituents are rich and can be a promising source for discovering drug candidates. The extract from mistletoe (Viscum album) is known to contain anticancer compounds; however, the specific molecular mechanism of the bioactive compounds is unknown. This study examines the pancreatic cancer therapeutic potential of the bioactive compounds in the flavonoid and phenolic acid constituents of mistletoe by adopting structural bioinformatics and advanced theoretical chemistry techniques via molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation, molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) calculations, pharmacokinetic analysis, and density functional theory analysis. The six best compounds from the flavonoid constituent with the highest binding affinity ranging from -6.8 kcal/mol to -6.7 kcal/mol were selected with the control gemcitabine (-5.5 kcal/mol) for further computational analysis after molecular docking. Furthermore, MM/GBSA calculation showed the highest binding energy for the selected docked compounds, which validates their inhibitory potential. Hence, the molecular dynamics simulation, post-simulation analysis, pharmacokinetics model, and DFT results showed that mistletoe compounds are reliable due to their stable interaction with the target protein and drug-likeness properties.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

AB The benefits of native mass spectrometry have led to the extensive study of proteins inside mass spectrometers in the gas phase. The expansion of native mass spectrometry requires novel tools for gaining greater insights into protein structures. Herein, we introduce a new approach utilizing gas phase ion/ion reactions, where cross-linking reagents link unprotonated lysine residues, arginine residues, and N-termini with their protonated forms. We used three lengths of linkers, determining that different length cross-linkers resulted in different residues being cross-linked, as we have previously observed for electrostatic-to-electrostatic cross-linkers. However, this new method allows for the probing of both protonated and neutral lysine and arginine residues. Native mass spectrometry often produces fewer charges than protonatable sites, allowing access to a greater number of sites on proteins using an electrostatic-to-covalent cross-linking approach. In this report, we describe the reaction phenomenology and trends at reaction sites. We envision electrostatic-to-covalent cross-linking as a useful structural tool to provide complementary information to other native MS-based measurements such as collision cross section.

AB We consider the problem of predictive modeling from irregularly and sparsely sampled longitudinal data with unknown, complex correlation structures and abrupt discontinuities. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel inducing clusters longitudinal deep kernel Gaussian Process (ICDKGP). ICDKGP approximates the data generating process by a zero-mean GP with a longitudinal deep kernel that models the unknown complex correlation structure in the data and a deterministic non-zero mean function to model the abrupt discontinuities. To improve the scalability and interpretability of ICDKGP, we introduce inducing clusters corresponding to centers of clusters in the training data. We formulate the training of ICDKGP as a constrained optimization problem and derive its evidence lower bound. We introduce a novel relaxation of the resulting problem which under rather mild assumptions yields a solution with error bounded relative to the original problem. We describe the results of extensive experiments demonstrating that ICDKGP substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art longitudinal methods on data with both smoothly and non-smoothly varying outcomes.

AB The oxidation of cycloalkanes is important in the combustion of transportation fuels and in atmospheric secondary organic aerosol formation. A transient carbon- centered radical intermediate (center dot QOOH) in the oxidation of cyclohexane is identified through its infrared fingerprint and time- and energy- resolved unimolecular dissociation dynamics to hydroxyl (OH) radical and bicyclic ether products. Although the cyclohexyl ring structure leads to three nearly degenerate center dot QOOH isomers ((3- , gamma-, and delta-QOOH), their transition state (TS) barriers to OH products are predicted to differ considerably. Selective characterization of the (3-QOOH isomer is achieved at excitation energies associated with the lowest TS barrier, resulting in rapid unimolecular decay to OH products that are detected. A benchmarking approach is employed for the calculation of high- accuracy stationary point energies, in particular TS barriers, for cyclohexane oxidation (C6H11O2), building on higher - level reference calculations for the smaller ethane oxidation (C2H5O2) system. The isomer- specific characterization of (3-QOOH is validated by comparison of experimental OH product appearance rates with computed statistical microcanonical rates, including significant heavy - atom tunneling, at energies in the vicinity of the TS barrier. Master- equation modeling is utilized to extend the results to thermal unimolecular decay rate constants at temperatures and pressures relevant to cyclohexane combustion.

AB The surfaces of colloidal nanocrystals are frequently passivated with carboxylate ligands that exert significant effects on their optoelectronic properties and chemical stability. The binding geometries of these ligands are often experimentally investigated using vibrational spectroscopy, but the interpretation of the IR signal is usually not trivial. Here, using machine-learning (ML) algorithms trained on DFT data, we simulate an IR spectrum of a lead-rich PbS nanocrystal passivated with butyrate ligands. We obtain good agreement with the experimental signal and demonstrate that the observed line shape stems from a very wide range of "tilted-bridge"-type geometries and does not indicate the coexistence of "bridging" and "chelating" binding modes as has been previously assumed. This work illustrates the limitations of empirical spectrum assignment and demonstrates the effectiveness of ML-driven molecular dynamics simulations in reproducing the IR spectra of nanoscopic systems.

AB Generative adversarial network (GAN) has attracted wide attention because of its remarkable ability to learn high-dimensional and complex data distributions based on game theory and machine learning. In this article, we focus on the role that GANs, which have been well researched and developed in recent years, play in wireless communications. With the gradual increase in communication rates and the complicacy of communication scenarios, some urgent issues have emerged, such as complex channel generation, high-dimensional channel estimation, and insufficient real-world signal acquisition. The powerful nonlinear fitting property of GAN-whose applications can be categorized into data generation, performance optimization, and data classification according to different purposes and network structures-can break through the bottleneck of traditional communication techniques. For each category, a universal network structure summarizing the characteristics and targets is investigated, and the performance of GANs in communication is also analyzed with simulation examples. Finally, the open research issues are discussed to provide some directions for future study.

AB The catalytic enantioselective synthesis of alpha-chiral alkenes and alkynes represents a powerful strategy for rapid generation of molecular complexity. Herein, we report a transient directing group (TDG) strategy to facilitate site-selective palladium-catalyzed reductive Heck-type hydroalkenylation and hydroalkynylation of alkenylaldehyes using alkenyl and alkynyl bromides, respectively, allowing for construction of a stereocenter at the delta-position with respect to the aldehyde. Computational studies reveal the dual beneficial roles of rigid TDGs, such as L-tert-leucine, in promoting TDG binding and inducing high levels of enantioselectivity in alkene insertion with a variety of migrating groups.

AB While ensemble methods can tackle concept drifts, obtaining pretrained models and conducting ensemble learning upon streamed data impose fundamental challenges, including the dynamic balance between system overhead and inference accuracy in uncertain system environments, and the interlacement between desired economic properties and long-term participation. In this paper, we propose the joint optimization which enables service providers to obtain models via repetitive auctions from the model providers and conduct ensemble methods online in a cost-efficient manner. We design polynomial-time online algorithms to solve the underlying non-linear mixed-integer social cost minimization problem, involving bid selection, payment allocation, model hosting, and ensemble model-weight adaption. We further rigorously prove the performance guarantees with our approach, such as the sub-linear dynamic regret for the bidding cost, the sub-linear dynamic fit for the long-term participation constraint, the truthfulness and the individual rationality for the auctions, the upper bound for ensemble inference loss, and the parameterized-constant competitive ratio for the long-term social cost. Through extensive trace-driven evaluations under real-world settings, we have validated the significant advantages of our approach over multiple baselines and state-of-the-art algorithms.

AB RNA molecules often play critical roles in assisting the formation of membraneless organelles in eukaryotic cells. Yet, little is known about the organization of RNAs within membraneless organelles. Here, using super -resolution imaging and nuclear speckles as a model system, we demonstrate that different sequence domains of RNA transcripts exhibit differential spatial distributions within speckles. Specifically, we image transcripts containing a region enriched in binding motifs of serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins and another region enriched in binding motifs of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs). We show that these transcripts localize to the outer shell of speckles, with the SR motif -rich region localizing closer to the speckle center relative to the hnRNP motif -rich region. Further, we identify that this intra-speckle RNA organization is driven by the strength of RNA -protein interactions inside and outside speckles. Our results hint at novel functional roles of nuclear speckles and likely other membraneless organelles in organizing RNA substrates for biochemical reactions.

TI Water-Hydrocarbon Interactions in Anionic Pyrene Monohydrate

AB Interactions between water and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are essential in many aspects of chemistry, from interstellar and atmospheric processes to interfacial hydrophobicity and wetting phenomena. Despite their growing importance, the intermolecular potentials of the water-hydrocarbon interactions are underdeveloped compared to the water-water potentials, and there are similarly few experimental probes that are sensitive to the details of the water-hydrocarbon potential. We present a combined experimental and computational study of anionic pyrene monohydrate, one of the simplest water/hydrocarbon clusters. The action spectrum in the OH region of the mass-selected cluster ion provides a rigorous benchmark for intermolecular potentials and computational methodologies. We identify missing intermolecular interactions and shortcomings in conventional dynamics calculations by comparing experimental data to density functional theory and classical molecular dynamics calculations. Kinetic trapping is prevalent, even for one water molecule and one pyrene molecule, leading to slow equilibration in conventional molecular dynamics calculations, even on nanosecond time scales and at low temperatures (50 K). At constant energy, temperature fluctuations for the pair of molecules are substantial. Immersing the system in a bath of soft spheres and employing parallel tempering alleviates kinetic trapping and dampens temperature fluctuations, bringing the system closer to the thermodynamic limit. With such augmented sampling, a simple, flexible water model reproduces the line width and the asymmetric broadening of the symmetric OH stretching mode, which we assign to spectral diffusion. In the OH stretching region, dynamics calculations predict a more intense antisymmetric peak than experiments observe but do not predict the bimodal split symmetric peak that the experiments show. Our work suggests that electronic polarization, missing in the empirical force field, is responsible for the first discrepancy and that quantum nuclear effects, captured neither in density functional theory nor in classical dynamics, may be responsible for the second.

AB A significant proportion of antimicrobial agents, such as different antibiotics discharged into the environment via human and animal waste, poses significant problems for ecological balance and human health. Moreover, widespread overuse and misuse of antibiotics have led to antibiotic-resistant bacteria (superbugs), which is one of the biggest global health problems in the 21st century. Since the utilization of solar energy, which is an abundant and natural resource for the photocatalytic system, we report the design of a photothermal-photocatalytic dual-functional light absorber-based ternary heterostructure using plasmonic gold nanoparticle (AuNP)-anchored WO3 nanoplatelet (WO3 NPL)-decorated reduced graphene oxide (r-GO) (AuNP/WO3 NPL/r-GO), which exhibits strong absorption between 400 and 900 nm regions and has the capability for the sunlight-driven 100% degradation of doxycycline antibiotics. Herein, we show that due to the excellent photothermal performance of AuNP and r-GO in the heterostructure, the local temperature increased under 785 NIR nm light irradiation, which boosted the photocatalytic degradation reaction kinetics for doxycycline antibiotics via enhancing the transfer of "hot carriers" and the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, experimental data indicate that by integrating photothermal-photocatalytic materials, sunlight can be used for 100% doxycycline antibiotic degradation after 80 min of light irradiation. Moreover, we demonstrate that the ternary heterostructure can be used for sunlight-based 100% inactivation of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae Escherichia coli (CRE E. coli) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) superbugs by just exposing them to light for 60 min. This study sheds light on the construction of photothermally assisted photocatalytic ternary heterostructures for high-efficiency sunlight-driven degradation of antibiotics and superbugs.

AB Understanding how neural circuits generate sequential activity is a longstanding challenge. While foundational theoretical models have shown how sequences can be stored as memories in neural networks with Hebbian plasticity rules, these models considered only a narrow range of Hebbian rules. Here, we introduce a model for arbitrary Hebbian plasticity rules, capturing the diversity of spike-timing-dependent synaptic plasticity seen in experiments, and show how the choice of these rules and of neural activity patterns influences sequence memory formation and retrieval. In particular, we derive a general theory that predicts the tempo of sequence replay. This theory lays a foundation for explaining how cortical tutor signals might give rise to motor actions that eventually become "automatic." Our theory also captures the impact of changing the tempo of the tutor signal. Beyond shedding light on biological circuits, this theory has relevance in artificial intelligence by laying a foundation for frameworks whereby slow and computationally expensive deliberation can be stored as memories and eventually replaced by inexpensive recall.

AB Evaporation patterns of liquid droplets containing nanoparticles or colloids have extensive applications in diagnostics and printing. Controlling these patterns by studying the evaporation behavior of colloidal droplets on surfaces is important for enhancing sensing platforms. In this study, A liquid-repellent microcavity surface is introduced to robustly capture deposited analytic particles. The proposed microcavity surface maintains stable air pockets for liquid repellency and strong pinning for the spatial stabilization of the evaporating droplet, thereby resulting in a coffee-ring concentration. This microcavity surface also acts as a "microcontainer" for the deposited particles, thereby protecting them against external damage. To demonstrate the multifaceted capabilities of microcavity surfaces, further comparison is done of three different surface structures, planar, micropillared, and that with microcavities in a hexagonal arrangement, by analyzing their evaporation dynamics and dried deposit patterns. The microcavity surface exhibits superior particle capture, thereby revealing its applicability in on-site testing. Using the direct rapid sampling of analytical materials, the potential of the fabricated microcavity surface for point-of-care testing is demonstrated. The proposed microcavity surfaces suggest new avenues for the development of more robust and sensitive sensing platforms.

AB Matching is one of the simplest approaches for estimating causal effects from observational data. Matching techniques compare the observed outcomes across pairs of individuals with similar covariate values but different treatment statuses in order to estimate causal effects. However, traditional matching techniques are unreliable given high-dimensional covariates due to the infamous curse of dimensionality. To overcome this challenge, we propose a simple, fast, yet highly effective approach to matching using Random Hyperplane Tessellations (RHPT). First, we prove that the RHPT representation is an approximate balancing score - thus maintaining the strong ignorability assumption - and provide empirical evidence for this claim. Second, we report results of extensive experiments showing that matching using RHPT outperforms traditional matching techniques and is competitive with state-of-the-art deep learning methods for causal effect estimation. In addition, RHPT avoids the need for computationally expensive training of deep neural networks.

AB A combination of nonionic, cationic, and zwitterionic surfactants is shown both to stabilize the transmembrane protein proteorhodopsin, as well as to direct coassembly into robust transparent mesostructured silica-surfactant films containing high loadings of functionally active protein guests. Proteorhodopsin is a transmembrane protein that exhibits light-activated H+ transport properties, the photocycle kinetics of which are quantified by time-resolved UV-visible spectroscopy and demonstrated to be similar to proteorhodopsin in the abiotic mesostructured films compared to native-like lipids. The surfactants mediate the pK(a) of a key ion-channel residue, leading to an expanded pH functional range for proteorhodopsin in mesostructured silica-surfactant host materials. Small-angle X-ray diffraction results for 100-mu m films show high extents of mesoscale order with protein loadings up to 25 wt % and wormlike mesostructural order for 44 wt % proteorhodopsin. Solid-state H-1, C-13, and Si-29 NMR analyses provide atomic-scale insights into the compositions and interactions at the mesochannel surfaces, which account for the structure-directing roles of surfactant species. Nanoindentation measurements reveal the mechanical robustness of the films, which interestingly increases with proteorhodopsin loading for the compositions examined. Heat treatment analyses show improved thermal stability for proteorhodopsin to 110( degrees)C within mesostructurally ordered films. The results establish closely correlated relationships between the compositions, nano- and mesoscale structures, photocycle kinetics, and macroscopic mechanical properties and thermal stabilities of the silica-surfactant- proteorhodopsin films, providing key biomimetic design criteria.

AB Advances in telecommunications require electronics that operate at ever-increasing frequencies, exemplified by 5G or fifth-generation technologies that operate in the GHz regime. At high frequencies, electrical circuits are plagued by so-called RC delays, arising from the time constant tau = RC for electrical signals which is the product of the resistance R and the capacitance C, respectively, of conductors and their insulating substrates. Besides using high quality, low-R electrical conductors such as high-purity Cu with low surface roughness, small RC delays are achieved by lowering the dielectric constant kappa of the materials used in printed circuit board substrates. These largely comprise particles of an inorganic material, notably functionalized SiO2, embedded in a polymer-based matrix. The value of kappa of the composite is primarily dictated by kappa of the inorganic material. The properties of the inorganic component also impact other relevant parameters such as the quality factor, mechanical strength, and thermal expansion of the substrate. Here, we ask whether there are inorganic compounds with dielectric constants (measured at 10 GHz) that are lower than that of SiO2 and potentially replace it in electronics. We describe the key characteristics for low-kappa materials and develop a framework for screening such compounds by employing some guiding principles, followed by using a combination of empirical estimates and density functional perturbation theory-based calculations. We then report experimental results on two promising aluminum-based low-kappa compounds for high-frequency applications. The first is the cristobalite form of AlPO4. The second is the simplest 3D metal-organic framework, aluminum formate Al(HCOO)(3). The measured values of kappa at 10 GHz, which are 4.0 for AlPO4 and 3.8 for Al(HCOO)(3), compare well with what is measured on SiO2 particles.

AB Graph neural networks (GNNs), which propagate the node features through the edges and learn how to transform the aggregated features under label supervision, have achieved great success in supervised feature extraction for both node-level and graph-level classification tasks. However, GNNs typically treat the graph structure as given and ignore how the edges are formed. This paper introduces a graph generative process to model how the observed edges are generated by aggregating the node interactions over a set of overlapping node communities, each of which contributes to the edges via a logical OR mechanism. Based on this generative model, we partition each edge into the summation of multiple community-specific weighted edges and use them to define community-specific GNNs. A variational inference framework is proposed to jointly learn a GNN-based inference network that partitions the edges into different communities, these community-specific GNNs, and a GNN-based predictor that combines community-specific GNNs for the end classification task. Extensive evaluations on real-world graph datasets have verified the effectiveness of the proposed method in learning discriminative representations for both node-level and graph-level classification tasks.

TI Molecular dynamics and machine learning stratify motion-dependent
   activity profiles of S-layer destabilizing nanobodies
SO PNAS NEXUS

DT Article
ID SURFACE-LAYER; REFINEMENT; MODEL
AB Nanobody (Nb)-induced disassembly of surface array protein (Sap) S-layers, a two-dimensional paracrystalline protein lattice from Bacillus anthracis, has been presented as a therapeutic intervention for lethal anthrax infections. However, only a subset of existing Nbs with affinity to Sap exhibit depolymerization activity, suggesting that affinity and epitope recognition are not enough to explain inhibitory activity. In this study, we performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of each Nb bound to the Sap binding site and trained a collection of machine learning classifiers to predict whether each Nb induces depolymerization. We used feature importance analysis to filter out unnecessary features and engineered remaining features to regularize the feature landscape and encourage learning of the depolymerization mechanism. We find that, while not enforced in training, a gradient-boosting decision tree is able to reproduce the experimental activities of inhibitory Nbs while maintaining high classification accuracy, whereas neural networks were only able to discriminate between classes. Further feature analysis revealed that inhibitory Nbs restrain Sap motions toward an inhibitory conformational state described by domain-domain clamping and induced twisting of domains normal to the lattice plane. We believe these motions drive Sap lattice depolymerization and can be used as design targets for improved Sap-inhibitory Nbs. Finally, we expect our method of study to apply to S-layers that serve as virulence factors in other pathogens, paving the way forward for Nb therapeutics that target depolymerization mechanisms.

AB We report that differences in ring strain enthalpy between cis and trans isomers of sila-cycloheptene provide a driving force for both polymerization and depolymerization via olefin metathesis. A need for new methods to reintroduce the low-strain isomer into the plastic economy inspired the development of a polymerization based on ring-opening/cross-metathesis step polymerization, which afforded perfect sequence control for an alternating copolymer. The chemical principles are a platform for achieving both efficient polymerization and depolymerization with high mass recovery in functional polymers.

AB Among various techniques designed for studying open-shell species, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy plays an important role. The key quantity measured by EPR is the g-tensor, describing the coupling between an external magnetic field and molecular electronic spin. One theoretical framework for quantum chemistry calculations of g-tensors is based on response theory, which involves substantial developments that are specific to the underlying electronic structure models. A simplified and easier-to-implement approach is based on the state-interaction scheme, in which perturbation is included by considering a small number of states. We describe and benchmark the state-interaction approach using equation-of-motion coupled-cluster and restricted-active-space configuration interaction wave functions. The analysis confirms that this approach can deliver accurate results and highlights caveats of applying it, such as a choice of the reference state, convergence with respect to the number of states used in calculations, etc. The analysis also contributes toward a better understanding of challenges in calculations of higher-order properties using approximate wave functions.

AB SEquence Evaluation through k-mer Representation (SEEKR) is a method of sequence comparison that uses sequence substrings called k-mers to quantify the nonlinear similarity between nucleic acid species. We describe the development of new functions within SEEKR that enable end-users to estimate P-values that ascribe statistical significance to SEEKR-derived similarities, as well as visualize different aspects of k-mer similarity. We apply the new functions to identify chromatin-enriched lncRNAs that contain XIST-like sequence features, and we demonstrate the utility of applying SEEKR on lncRNA fragments to identify potential RNA-protein interaction domains. We also highlight ways in which SEEKR can be applied to augment studies of lncRNA conservation, and we outline the best practice of visualizing RNA-seq read density to evaluate support for lncRNA annotations before their in-depth study in cell types of interest.

TI An Areal Approach to Spatial Accessibility Analysis
SO GEOGRAPHICAL ANALYSIS
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
ID HEALTH-CARE; GIS ENVIRONMENT; CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE; CHICAGO
AB Place-based spatial accessibility quantifies the distribution of access to goods and services across space. The Two-Step Floating Catchment Area (2SFCA) family of methods have become a default tool for spatial accessibility analysis in part due to their intuitive approach and interpretability. This family of methods relies on calculating catchment areas around supply locations to estimate the area and population that may utilize them. However, these "catchment areas" are generally defined by origin-destination matrices of travel-time, giving us point-to-point distances and not polygons with actual area. This means that population geographies (census tracts, blocks, etc.) are binarily included or excluded, with no room for partial inclusion. When using nongranular data, which is often the case due to data privacy restrictions, this has the potential to cause significant errors in accessibility measurements. In this article, we propose Areal 2SFCA: a new approach that considers the area of overlap between travel-time polygons and population geographies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the Areal 2SFCA method using a case study that compares the Enhanced Two-Step Floating Catchment Area (E2SFCA) and Areal E2SFCA for the state of Illinois in the USA using multiple population granularities.

TI Probing Notch1-Dll4 signaling in regulating osteogenic differentiation

AB Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) have great potential in cell-based therapies for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine due to their self-renewal and multipotent properties. Recent studies indicate that Notch1-Dll4 signaling is an important pathway in regulating osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs. However, the fundamental mechanisms that govern osteogenic differentiation are poorly understood due to a lack of effective tools to detect gene expression at single cell level. Here, we established a double-stranded locked nucleic acid (LNA)/DNA (LNA/DNA) nanobiosensor for gene expression analysis in single hMSC in both 2D and 3D microenvironments. We first characterized this LNA/DNA nanobiosensor and demonstrated the Dll4 mRNA expression dynamics in hMSCs during osteogenic differentiation. By incorporating this nanobiosensor with live hMSCs imaging during osteogenic induction, we performed dynamic tracking of hMSCs differentiation and Dll4 mRNA gene expression profiles of individual hMSC during osteogenic induction. Our results showed the dynamic expression profile of Dll4 during osteogenesis, indicating the heterogeneity of hMSCs during this dynamic process. We further investigated the role of Notch1-Dll4 signaling in regulating hMSCs during osteogenic differentiation. Pharmacological perturbation is applied to disrupt Notch1-Dll4 signaling to investigate the molecular mechanisms that govern osteogenic differentiation. In addition, the effects of Notch1-Dll4 signaling on hMSCs spheroids differentiation were also investigated. Our results provide convincing evidence supporting that Notch1-Dll4 signaling is involved in regulating hMSCs osteogenic differentiation. Specifically, Notch1-Dll4 signaling is active during osteogenic differentiation. Our results also showed that Dll4 is a molecular signature of differentiated hMSCs during osteogenic induction. Notch inhibition mediated osteogenic differentiation with reduced Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) activity. Lastly, we elucidated the role of Notch1-Dll4 signaling during osteogenic differentiation in a 3D spheroid model. Our results showed that Notch1-Dll4 signaling is required and activated during osteogenic differentiation in hMSCs spheroids. Inhibition of Notch1-Dll4 signaling mediated osteogenic differentiation and enhanced hMSCs proliferation, with increased spheroid sizes. Taken together, the capability of LNA/DNA nanobiosensor to probe gene expression dynamics during osteogenesis, combined with the engineered 2D/3D microenvironment, enables us to study in detail the role of Notch1-Dll4 signaling in regulating osteogenesis in 2D and 3D microenvironment. These findings will provide new insights to improve cell-based therapies and organ repair techniques.

AB The specific nature of CRISPR-Cas12a makes it a desirable RNA-guided endonuclease for biotechnology and therapeutic applications. To understand how R-loop formation within the compact Cas12a enables target recognition and nuclease activation, we used cryo-electron microscopy to capture wild-type Acidaminococcus sp. Cas12a R-loop intermediates and DNA delivery into the RuvC active site. Stages of Cas12a R-loop formation-starting from a 5-bp seed-are marked by distinct REC domain arrangements. Dramatic domain flexibility limits contacts until nearly complete R-loop formation, when the non-target strand is pulled across the RuvC nuclease and coordinated domain docking promotes efficient cleavage. Next, substantial domain movements enable target strand repositioning into the RuvC active site. Between cleavage events, the RuvC lid conformationally resets to occlude the active site, requiring re-activation. These snapshots build a structural model depicting Cas12a DNA targeting that rationalizes observed specificity and highlights mechanistic comparisons to other class 2 effectors.

   Consequences of data bias
AB Energy justice advocates for the equitable and accessible provision of energy services, mainly focusing on marginalized communities. Adopting machine learning in analyzing energy-related data can unintentionally reinforce social inequalities. This perspective highlights the stages in the machine learning process where biases may emerge, from data collection and model development to deployment. Each phase presents distinct challenges and consequences, ultimately influencing the fairness and accuracy of machine learning models. The ramifications of machine learning bias within the energy sector are profound, encompassing issues such as inequalities, the perpetuation of negative feedback loops, privacy concerns regarding, and economic impacts arising from energy burden and energy poverty. Recognizing and rectifying these biases is imperative for leveraging technology to advance society rather than perpetuating existing injustices. Addressing biases at the intersection of energy justice and machine learning requires a comprehensive approach, acknowledging the interconnectedness of social, economic, and technological factors.

TI Time-dependent density functional theory with the orthogonal projector
   augmented wave method
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
LA English

ID ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE CALCULATIONS; REAL-SPACE; AB-INITIO; IMPLEMENTATION
AB The projector augmented wave (PAW) method of Blochl linearly maps smooth pseudo wavefunctions to the highly oscillatory all-electron DFT orbitals. Compared to norm-conserving pseudopotentials (NCPP), PAW has the advantage of lower kinetic energy cutoffs and larger grid spacing at the cost of having to solve for non-orthogonal wavefunctions. We earlier developed orthogonal PAW (OPAW) to allow the use of PAW when orthogonal wavefunctions are required. In OPAW, the pseudo wavefunctions are transformed through the efficient application of powers of the PAW overlap operator with essentially no extra cost compared to NCPP methods. Previously, we applied OPAW to DFT. Here, we take the first step to make OPAW viable for post-DFT methods by implementing it in real-time time-dependent (TD) DFT. Using fourth-order Runge-Kutta for the time-propagation, we compare calculations of absorption spectra for various organic and biological molecules and show that very large grid spacings are sufficient, 0.6-0.7 bohr in OPAW-TDDFT rather than the 0.4-0.5 bohr used in traditional NCPP-TDDFT calculations. This reduces the memory and propagation costs by around a factor of 3. Our method would be directly applicable to any post-DFT methods that require time-dependent propagations such as the GW approximation and the Bethe-Salpeter equation.

AB Oxygen defects in Ni-CeO2 catalysts play an important role in CO2 methanation. Herein, efforts are centered on enhancing the concentration of oxygen defects by tuning the Ni-CeO2 catalyst morphology to enhance methane productivity. A relationship between oxygen defect concentration, the structure of Ni-CeO2 catalysts and catalytic performance for CO2 methanation is established through a combination of catalyst characterization (scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), temperature programmed reduction (H-2-TPR), H-2 pulse chemisorption, X-ray diffraction, in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), and Raman spectroscopy) and kinetic studies. Raman studies indicated that (i) inverse Ni-CeO2 catalyst structures, along with (ii) incorporation of low amounts (<1 wt%) of aliovalent, rare-earth metal dopants, such as Pr, enhanced the formation of oxygen defects, consequently leading to high methane productivity. In situ DRIFTS studies showed that CO2 methanation over Ni-CeO2 inverse catalysts with the best catalytic performance followed a formate reaction pathway.

AB Machine learning (ML) methods have reached high accuracy levels for the prediction of in vacuo molecular properties. However, the simulation of large systems solely through ML methods (such as those based on neural network potentials) is still a challenge. In this context, one of the most promising frameworks for integrating ML schemes in the simulation of complex molecular systems are the so-called ML/MM methods. These multiscale approaches combine ML methods with classical force fields (MM), in the same spirit as the successful hybrid quantum mechanics-molecular mechanics methods (QM/MM). The key issue for such ML/MM methods is an adequate description of the coupling between the region of the system described by ML and the region described at the MM level. In the context of QM/MM schemes, the main ingredient of the interaction is electrostatic, and the state of the art is the so-called electrostatic-embedding. In this study, we analyze the quality of simpler mechanical embedding-based approaches, specifically focusing on their application within a ML/MM framework utilizing atomic partial charges derived in vacuo. Taking as reference electrostatic embedding calculations performed at a QM(DFT)/MM level, we explore different atomic charges schemes, as well as a polarization correction computed using atomic polarizabilites. Our benchmark data set comprises a set of about 80k small organic structures from the ANI-1x and ANI-2x databases, solvated in water. The results suggest that the minimal basis iterative stockholder (MBIS) atomic charges yield the best agreement with the reference coupling energy. Remarkable enhancements are achieved by including a simple polarization correction.

AB In this paper, we address key challenges in Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchains, with a particular focus on Ethereum 2.0. We introduce an innovative mechanism that combines Tullock contests and signaling games to optimize weight assignments based on security deposits from heterogeneous nodes. While Tullock contests motivate participants to allocate resources for potential rewards, signaling games enable efficient information transfer, thereby enriching decision-making. This approach enhances network security, efficiency, and resilience by incentivizing resource investment and facilitating effective information exchange. Our framework significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving a 45.43% increase in blockchain utility and a 47.92% rise in node utility. Additionally, it yields marked improvements in user participation rates (26.89 - 32.21%) and service coverage (24 - 29.54%), and also proves to be resilient against attacks from selfish nodes.

DT Review
ID SOFTWARE
AB Methods for analyzing the full complement of a biomolecule type, e.g., proteomics or metabolomics, generate large amounts of complex data. The software tools used to analyze omics data have reshaped the landscape of modern biology and become an essential component of biomedical research. These tools are themselves quite complex and often require the installation of other supporting software, libraries and/or databases. A researcher may also be using multiple different tools that require different versions of the same supporting materials. The increasing dependence of biomedical scientists on these powerful tools creates a need for easier installation and greater usability. Packaging and containerization are different approaches to satisfy this need by delivering omics tools already wrapped in additional software that makes the tools easier to install and use. In this systematic review, we describe and compare the features of prominent packaging and containerization platforms. We outline the challenges, advantages and limitations of each approach and some of the most widely used platforms from the perspectives of users, software developers and system administrators. We also propose principles to make the distribution of omics software more sustainable and robust to increase the reproducibility of biomedical and life science research.
   Attempts to reproduce the computational steps described in published omics research often fail. This review provides guidelines for the packaging and containerization of software so that readers can use the exact programs used in published work.

AB Biochar is increasingly used in climate-smart agriculture, yet its impact on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and soil carbon (C) sequestration remains poorly understood. This study examined biochar-mediated changes in soil properties and their contribution to C stabilization and GHG mitigation by evaluating four types of biochar. Soil carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions, soil chemical and biological properties, and soil organic carbon (SOC) mineralization kinetics were monitored using greenhouse, laboratory, and modeling experiments. Three pine wood biochars pyrolyzed at 460 degrees C (PB-460), 500 degrees C (PB-500), 700 degrees C (PB-700), and one pine bark biochar from gasification at 760 degrees C (GB -760) were added into soil at 1 % w /w basis. Soils amended with biochar were used to cultivate sorghum for three months in a greenhouse, followed by three months of laboratory incubation. Data obtained from laboratory incubation was modeled using various statistical approaches. The PB500 and PB-700 reduced cumulative N 2 O-N emissions by 68.5 % and 73.9 % and CO 2 equivalent C emissions by 66.9 % and 72.4 %, respectively, compared to unamended control. The N 2 O emissions were positively associated with soil nitrate N, available P, and biochar ash content while negatively associated with SOC. The CO 2 emission was negatively related to biochar C:N ratio and volatile matter content. Biochar amended soils had 49.2 % (PB-500) to 87.7 % (PB-700) greater SOC and 22.9 % (PB-700) to 48.1 % (GB -760) greater sorghum yield than the control. While PB-700 had more saprophytes than the control, the GB -760 yielded a greater yield than biochars prepared by pyrolysis. Microbial biomass C was 7.23 to 23.3 % greater in biochar amended soils than in control. The double exponential decay model best explained the dynamics of C mineralization, which was associated with initial soil nitrate N and available P positively and total fungi and protozoa biomass negatively. Biochar amendment could be a climate smart agricultural strategy. Pyrolysis pine wood biochar showed the greatest potential to reduce GHG emissions and enhance SOC storage and stability, and gasification biochar contributed more to SOC storage and increased crop yield.

ID CODE
AB The electrical environment of a ground vacuum testing chamber creates facility effects for gridded ion thrusters. For example, it is well known that the plume from the thruster generates current paths that are very different from what occurs in space, and the neutralization of this plume is also different. For reasons such as this, it is important to clarify how the experimental testing environment affects plasma flows, but understanding this effect solely through ground experiments is difficult. To that end, this study utilizes particle-in-cell and direct simulation Monte Carlo methods to simulate xenon beam ions and electrons emitted from a neutralizer. First, we compare simulations conducted within the chamber to those conducted in space, demonstrating that grounded chamber walls increase the electric potential and electron temperature. Next, we investigate the impact of the neutralizer's position and the background pressure on the plume in the vacuum chamber. We find that as the neutralizer position moves closer to the location of maximum potential, more electrons are extracted, resulting in increased neutralization of the plume. We also observe that high background pressure generates slow charge-exchange ions, creating ion sheaths on the side walls that alter ion current paths. Finally, we discuss how the potential at the thruster and neutralizer exits affects the plume. The relative potential of the neutralizer to the vacuum chamber wall is observed to significantly influence the behavior of the electrons, thereby altering the degree of plume neutralization. These findings are shown to be consistent with experimental results in the literature and demonstrate the promise of high-performance simulation.

AB Women and racially and ethnically minoritized populations are underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Out-of-school time programs like summer camps can provide positive science experiences that may increase self-efficacy and awareness of STEM opportunities. Such programs often use the same high-impact practices used in K-12 classrooms including relating concepts to real-world examples, engaging students as active participants in inquiry-driven projects, and facilitating learning in a cooperative context. They additionally provide opportunities for engaging in STEM without fear of failure, offer a community of mentors, and allow families to become more involved. We designed a summer camp for middle schoolers who identified as girls, low-income, and as a minoritized race or ethnicity. We describe the design of the camp as well as the results from a simple pre- and post-camp questionnaire that examined each camper's relationship to science, scientific self-efficacy, and interest in having a job in STEM. We found an increase in self-efficacy in camp participants, which is important because high scientific self-efficacy predicts student performance and persistence in STEM, especially for girls. We did not detect an increase in interest in pursuing a STEM job, likely because of already high values for this question on the pre-camp survey. We add to the growing body of work recognizing the potential of out-of-school time STEM programs to increase scientific self-efficacy for girls and racially minoritized students.
   Tweet: Summer camp for minoritized middle-school girls increases scientific self-efficacy, a characteristic that may be important for removing barriers to participation in STEM.

AB One of the major impediments to the computational investigation and design of complex alloys such as steel is the lack of effective and versatile interatomic potentials to perform large-scale calculations. In this study, we developed an RF-MEAM potential for the iron-carbon (Fe-C) system to predict the elastic properties at elevated temperatures. Several potentials were produced by fitting potential parameters to the various datasets containing forces, energies, and stress tensor data generated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The potentials were then evaluated using a two-step filter process. In the first step, the optimized RSME error function of the potential fitting code, MEAMfit, was used as the selection criterion. In the second step, molecular dynamics (MD) calculations were employed to calculate ground-state elastic properties of structures present in the training set of the data fitting process. The calculated single crystal and poly-crystalline elastic constants for various Fe-C structures were compared with the DFT and experimental results. The resulting best potential accurately predicted the ground state elastic properties of B1, cementite, and orthorhombic-Fe7C3 (O-Fe7C3), and also calculated the phonon spectra in good agreement with the DFT-calculated ones for cementite and O-Fe7C3. Furthermore, the potential was used to successfully predict the elastic properties of interstitial Fe-C alloys (FeC-0.2% and FeC-0.4%) and O-Fe7C3 at elevated temperatures. The results were in good agreement with the published literature. The successful prediction of elevated temperature properties of structures not included in data fitting validated the potential's ability to model elevated-temperature elastic properties.

TI Discovering quirks through timing at FASER and future forward
   experiments at the LHC
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
LA English
DT Article
DE New Gauge Interactions; Specific BSM Phenomenology
AB Quirks are generic predictions of strongly-coupled dark sectors. For weak-scale masses and a broad range of confining scales in the dark sector, quirks can be discovered only at the energy frontier, but quirk-anti-quirk pairs are produced with unusual signatures at low pT, making them difficult to detect at the large LHC detectors. We determine the prospects for discovering quirks using timing information at FASER, FASER2, and an "ultimate detector" in the far-forward region at the LHC. NLO QCD corrections are incorporated in the simulation of quirk production, which can significantly increase the production rate. To accurately propagate quirk pairs from the ATLAS interaction point to the forward detectors, the ionization energy loss of charged quirks traveling through matter, the radiation of infracolor glueballs and QCD hadrons during quirk pair oscillations, and the annihilation of quirkonium are properly considered. The quirk signal is separated from the large muon background using timing information from scintillator detectors by requiring either two coincident delayed tracks, based on arrival times at the detector, or two coincident slow tracks, based on time differences between hits in the front and back scintillators. We find that simple cuts preserve much of the signal, but reduce the muon background to negligible levels. With the data already collected, FASER can discover quirks in currently unconstrained parameter space. FASER2, running at the Forward Physics Facility during the HL-LHC era, will greatly extend this reach, probing the TeV-scale quirk masses motivated by the gauge hierarchy problem for the broad range of dark-sector confining scales between 100 eV and 100 keV.

AB A combination of DFT calculations and experiments is used to describe how the selection of a promoter can control the stereochemical outcome of glycosylation reactions with the deoxy sugar saccharosamine. Depending on the promoter, either alpha- or beta-linked reactive intermediates are formed. These studies show that differential modes of activation lead to the formation of distinct intermediates that undergo highly selective reactions through an S(N)2-like mechanism.

AB Protein-protein complexes can vary in mechanical stability depending on the direction from which force is applied. Here, we investigated the mechanical stability of a complex between a binding scaffold called Affibody and an immune checkpoint protein Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1). We used AFM single-molecule force spectroscopy with bioorthogonal clickable peptide handles, shear stress bead adhesion assays, molecular modeling, and steered molecular dynamics (SMD) to understand the pulling point dependency of the mechanostability of the Affibody:(PD-L1) complex. We observed a wide range of rupture forces depending on the anchor point. Pulling from residue #22 on Affibody generated an intermediate state attributed to partially unfolded PD-L1, while pulling from Affibody's N-terminus generated a force-activated catch bond. Pulling from residue #22 or #47 on Affibody generated high rupture forces, with the complex breaking at up to similar to 190 pN under loading rates of similar to 104-105 pN/s, representing a similar to 4-fold increase as compared with low-force N-terminal pulling. SMD simulations showed relative tendencies in rupture forces that were consistent with experiments and, through visualization of force propagation networks, provided mechanistic insights. These results demonstrate how the mechanical properties of protein-protein interfaces can be controlled by informed choice of site-specific bioconjugation points within molecules, with implications for optimal bioconjugation strategies in drug delivery vehicles.

AB Accurate estimation of water column temperature is vital for modeling physical and biogeochemical processes. A key process in the thermal dynamics of the upper ocean is the attenuation of solar radiation. In shallow-turbid coastal systems, spatially and temporally varying optical characteristics present challenges for commonly used attenuation parameterization schemes. This study investigates the dependency of temperature with a ROMS model of Mobile Bay, a shallow, turbid estuary, using six different attenuation approaches including three base cases: Conventional approach PS77 based on water type-9; Novel approach SAL relating in situ PAR attenuation to salinity; and Surface trapped irradiance method ST. In addition, these base cases are also tested with surface atmospheric heat flux correction (QC). Simulations were validated against observations from various sources to identify the optimal approach at annual and synoptic scales. While all simulations showed effective temperature performance over an annual cycle, monthly analysis revealed some seasonality, with winter months typically performing better than summer months. The influence of QC notably enhanced temperature performance in both annual and synoptic scales, given that surface heat flux primarily drove temperature changes in this shallow system. The best overall performance was determined to be the ST approach incorporating QC. Conversely, PS77 without QC demonstrated the poorest performance. The SAL model with QC, notably improved performance over PS77 with QC, yet demonstrated comparable yet weaker performance compared to the ST model with QC. The study also implies that neglecting subseasonal validation in long-term regional climate modeling could introduce uncertainty into analyzing events tied to subseasonal temperatures.

AB Skatole is a pungent heterocyclic compound derived from the essential amino acid l-tryptophan by bacteria in the mammalian digestive tract. The four-step anaerobic conversion of tryptophan to skatole is well-established; though, to date, no aerobic counterpart has been reported. Herein, we report the discovery of the oxygen-dependent skatole synthase SktA that single-handedly converts 5-bromo-l-tryptophan to 5-bromoskatole, obviating the need for a multienzyme process. SktA is part of a three-gene biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) in the cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme NIES-2108 and functions as a nonheme diiron enzyme belonging to the heme oxygenase-like domain-containing oxidase (HDO) superfamily. Our detailed biochemical analyses revealed cyanide and bicarbonate as biosynthetic coproducts, while stopped-flow experiments showed the hallmark formation of a substrate-triggered peroxo Fe2(III) intermediate. Overall, this work unravels an alternative pathway for converting tryptophan to skatole while also expanding the functional repertoire of HDO enzymes.

AB The transition toward electric-powered devices is anticipated to play a pivotal role in advancing the global net-zero carbon emission agenda aimed at mitigating greenhouse effects. This shift necessitates a parallel focus on the development of energy storage materials capable of supporting intermittent renewable energy sources. While lithium-ion batteries, featuring inorganic electrode materials, exhibit desirable electrochemical characteristics for energy storage and transport, concerns about the toxicity and ethical implications associated with mining transition metals in their electrodes have prompted a search for environmentally safe alternatives. Organic electrodes have emerged as promising and sustainable alternatives for batteries. This review paper will delve into the recent advancements in nature-inspired electrode design aimed at addressing critical challenges such as capacity degradation due to dissolution, low operating voltages, and the intricate molecular-level processes governing macroscopic electrochemical properties.
   Organic cathode-based batteries experience rapid capacity fading, low voltages and understudied molecular-level electrochemical processes. Here, an overview of the molecular electrode design and functional group tuning is provided for stable capacities and high voltages while considering the fundamental electrochemical properties (thermodynamics, kinetics and mass transport) that dictate the molecular level characteristics of organic electrodes in batteries. image
