AB Optical continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems are emerging for personalized glucose management owing to their lower cost and prolonged durability compared to conventional electrochemical CGMs. Here, we report a computational CGM system, which integrates a biocompatible phosphorescence-based insertable biosensor and a custom-designed phosphorescence lifetime imager (PLI). This compact and cost-effective PLI is designed to capture phosphorescence lifetime images of an insertable sensor through the skin, where the lifetime of the emitted phosphorescence signal is modulated by the local concentration of glucose. Because this phosphorescence signal has a very long lifetime compared to tissue autofluorescence or excitation leakage processes, it completely bypasses these noise sources by measuring the sensor emission over several tens of microseconds after the excitation light is turned off. The lifetime images acquired through the skin are processed by neural network-based models for misalignment-tolerant inference of glucose levels, accurately revealing normal, low (hypoglycemia) and high (hyperglycemia) concentration ranges. Using a 1 mm thick skin phantom mimicking the optical properties of human skin, we performed in vitro testing of the PLI using glucose-spiked samples, yielding 88.8% inference accuracy, also showing resilience to random and unknown misalignments within a lateral distance of similar to 4.7 mm with respect to the position of the insertable sensor underneath the skin phantom. Furthermore, the PLI accurately identified larger lateral misalignments beyond 5 mm, prompting user intervention for realignment. The misalignment-resilient glucose concentration inference capability of this compact and cost-effective PLI makes it an appealing wearable diagnostics tool for real-time tracking of glucose and other biomarkers.

AB Carbon foam materials exhibit useful characteristics for unique and diverse applications. However, accurately modeling three-dimensional carbon foam remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a novel technique for transitioning atomistic-scale models of porous carbon, obtained via molecular dynamics simulation, to continuum-scale carbon foam models suited for finite element simulations. We present our method using the fractal properties of porous media, specifically carbon foams. The resulting models demonstrate testable properties consistent with those derived from computed tomography (CT) scans and experimental data. Stress-strain curves obtained from finite element analysis (FEA) calculations of our models correlate well with experimental measurements from dogbone testing samples of carbon foam sourced from CONSOL Innovations LLC, WV, USA, as well as CT scan models derived from the carbon foams. Our approach presents a computationally efficient alternative and encourages innovation in modeling porous media, particularly in extracting physical properties from an ensemble of models.

AB Chronic diseases, including diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and microvascular complications, contribute significantly to global morbidity and mortality. Current monitoring tools such as glucometers and continuous glucose monitors only measure one analyte; multiplexing technologies offer a promising approach for monitoring multiple biomarkers, enabling the management of comorbidities and providing more comprehensive disease insights. In this work, we describe a miniaturized optical "barcode" sensor with high biocompatibility for the continuous monitoring of glucose and oxygen. This enzymatic sensor relies on oxygen consumption in proportion to local glucose levels and the phosphorescence reporting of tissue oxygen with a lifetime-based probe. The sensor was specifically designed to operate in a tissue environment with low levels of dissolved oxygen. The barcode sensor consists of a poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) hydrogel with four discrete compartments separately filled with glucose- or oxygen-sensing phosphorescent microparticles. We evaluated the response of the barcode hydrogels to fluctuating glucose levels over the physiological range under low oxygen conditions, demonstrating the controlled tuning of dynamic range and sensitivity. Moreover, the barcode sensor exhibited remarkable storage stability over 12 weeks, along with full reversibility and excellent reproducibility (similar to 6% variability in the phosphorescence lifetime) over nearly 50 devices. Electron beam sterilization had a negligible effect on the glucose response of the barcode sensors. Furthermore, our investigation revealed minimal phosphorescence lifetime changes in oxygen compartments while exhibiting increased lifetime in glucose-responsive compartments when subjected to alternating glucose concentrations (0 and 200 mg/dL), showcasing the sensor's multianalyte sensing capabilities without crosstalk between compartments. Additionally, the evaluation of chronic tissue response to sensors inserted in pigs revealed the appropriate biocompatibility of the barcodes as well as excellent material stability over many months. These findings support further development of similar technologies for introducing optical assays for multiple biomarkers that can provide continuous or on-demand feedback to individuals to manage chronic conditions.

AB Survival analysis, aka time-to-event analysis, has a wide-ranging impact on patient care. Federated Survival Analysis (FSA) is an emerging Federated Learning (FL) paradigm for performing survival analysis on distributed decentralized data available at multiple medical institutions. FSA enables individual medical institutions, referred to as clients, to improve their survival predictions while ensuring privacy. However, FSA faces challenges due to non-linear and non-IID data distributions among clients, as well as bias caused by censoring. Although recent studies have adapted Cox Proportional Hazards (CoxPH) survival models for FSA, a systematic exploration of these challenges is currently lacking. In this paper, we address these critical challenges by introducing FedPseudo, a pseudo value-based deep learning framework for FSA. FedPseudo uses deep learning models to learn robust representations from non-linear survival data, leverages the power of pseudo values to handle non-uniform censoring, and employs FL algorithms such as FedAvg to learn model parameters. We propose a novel and simple approach for estimating pseudo values for FSA. We provide theoretical proof that the estimated pseudo values, referred to as Federated Pseudo Values, are consistent. Moreover, our empirical results demonstrate that they can be computed faster than traditional methods of deriving pseudo values. To ensure and enhance the privacy of both the estimated pseudo values and the shared model parameters, we systematically investigate the application of differential privacy (DP) on both the federated pseudo values and local model updates. Furthermore, we adapt V-Usable Information metric to quantify the informativeness of a client's data for training a survival model and utilize this metric to show the advantages of participating in FSA. We conducted extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world survival datasets to demonstrate that our FedPseudo framework achieves better performance than other FSA approaches and performs similarly to the best centrally trained deep survival model. Moreover, FedPseudo consistently achieves superior results across different censoring settings.

AB One of the significant challenges when a new virus circulates in a host population is to detect the outbreak as it arises in a timely fashion and implement the appropriate preventive policies to halt the spread of the disease effectively. The conventional computational epidemic models provide a state-space representation of the dynamic changes of various sub-clusters of a society based on their exposure to the virus and are primarily developed for small-size epidemics. In this work, we reformulate the conventional computational epidemic modeling approach inspired by the complex temporal dynamics observed during the COVID-19 pandemic. We utilize the Poisson point process to delineate transitions between various states, enabling us to track the exposed population effectively. The proposed model, based on random event-based Poisson arrivals, offers a comprehensive framework for understanding disease spread when the exposed state is intermediate between susceptibility and infectiousness and delays in implementing mitigation strategies are inevitable. Moreover, our newly proposed framework allows the construction of the transmission probability (p) as a probabilistic function of contributing factors such as virus mutation, immunity waning, and immunity resilience. Our results unravel the interplay between delays, transmission probability, vaccination, virus mutation, immunity loss, and their indirect impacts on the endemic states and waves of the spread. The proposed model provides a mathematical framework that allows policy-makers to improve preparedness for curtailing a lingering infectious disease spreading and unfolds the optimal time frame for vaccination given the available resources and the probability of virus mutation for the current and unforeseen outbreaks.

ID RESOLUTION
AB Reconstituted cytoskeleton composites have emerged as a valuable model system for studying non-equilibrium soft matter. The faithful capture of the dynamics of these 3D, dense networks calls for optical sectioning, which is often associated with fluorescence confocal microscopes. However, recent developments in light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) have established it as a cost-effective and, at times, superior alternative. To make LSFM accessible to cytoskeleton researchers less familiar with optics, we present a step-by-step beginner's guide to building a versatile light-sheet fluorescence microscope from off-the-shelf components. To enable sample mounting with traditional slide samples, this LSFM follows the single-objective lightsheet (SOLS) design, which utilizes a single objective for both the excitation and emission collection. We describe the function of each component of the SOLS in sufficient detail to allow readers to modify the instrumentation and design it to fit their specific needs. Finally, we demonstrate the use of this custom SOLS instrument by visualizing asters in kinesin-driven microtubule networks.

AB Holographic acoustic lenses (HALs), also known as acoustic holograms, are used for generating unprecedented complex focused ultrasound (FU) fields. HALs store the phase profile of the desired wavefront, which is used to reconstruct the acoustic pressure field when illuminated by a single acoustic source. Nonlinear effects occur as the sound intensity increases, leading to distorted and asymmetric waveforms. Here, the k-space pseudospectral method is used to perform homogeneous three-dimensional nonlinear acoustic simulations with power law absorption. An in-depth analysis is performed to study the evolution of holographic-modulated FU fields produced by HALs as the excitation amplitude increases. It is shown that nonlinear waveform distortion significantly affects the reconstruction of the pressure pattern when compared to the linear condition. Diffraction and nonlinear effects result in an asymmetric waveform with distinct positive and negative pressure patterns at the target plane. Peak positive pressure distribution becomes more localized around the areas with the highest nonlinear distortion. The peak signal-to-distortion ratio (PSDR) at the target plane falls while the nonuniformity index (NUI) rises. As a result of harmonic generation, the heat deposition distribution becomes highly localized with a significant increase in the NUI. Nonlinear effects have also been shown to flatten the peak negative pressure distribution while having minimal effect on the PSDR or NUI. However, nonlinear effects are shown to be critical for accurately predicting cavitation zones. Findings will pave the way for HALs implementation in high-intensity applications and prompt the incorporation of nonlinear acoustics into the notion of computer-generated holography.

ID HUMAN MOTION PREDICTION
AB Construction robots have great potential to serve as assistants to relieve construction workers from repetitive and physically demanding tasks. It is essential for robots to understand and predict human intention in order to adapt their motion to ensure smooth human-robot collaboration. This study proposes a long short-term memory model-based multi-task learning framework to simultaneously predict multi-level human intention in assembly tasks, including high-level actions and objects, and low-level body movements, from observed body movements and associated assembly components extracted from videos. The proposed models were trained and tested using 54 videos collected with nine participants performing six assembly tasks, achieving an accuracy of 82% and 98% in action and object prediction, respectively, and an average displacement error of 8.71 pixels in pose prediction. The incorporation of work context significantly improves the accuracy of object prediction by 11.36%, with the performance of other two tasks increasing slightly.

AB Automotive radar emerges as a crucial sensor for autonomous vehicle perception. As more cars are equipped radars, radar interference is an unavoidable challenge. Unlike conventional approaches such as interference mitigation and interference-avoiding technologies, this paper introduces an innovative collaborative sensing scheme with multiple automotive radars that exploits constructive interference. Through collaborative sensing, our method optimally aligns cross-path interference signals from other radars with another radar's self-echo signals, thereby significantly augmenting its target detection capabilities. This approach alleviates the need for extensive raw data sharing between collaborating radars. Instead, only an optimized weighting matrix needs to be exchanged between the radars. This approach considerably decreases the data bandwidth requirements for the wireless channel, making it a more feasible and practical solution for automotive radar collaboration. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the constructive interference approach for enhanced object detection capability.

AB Recent advances in robotics and artificial intelligence have influenced the broader adoption of human-robot collaboration (HRC) in industries such as manufacturing and healthcare, but the same cannot be said about construction due to the dynamic nature of the work environment. To facilitate informed decision-making in HRC adoption, there is a need to evaluate the potential benefits of incorporating robots in construction activities. This study evaluates the impact of HRC on construction workers' workload. Experiments involving human-robot collaborative wood assembly tasks were conducted, and workload levels of humans in different scenarios were evaluated using physiological data collected with a wearable sensing device. Thereafter, a survey was administered to participants to assess their mental workload. Findings show that HRC posed less workload on workers compared to human-human collaboration, which demonstrates the potential benefits of HRC in the aspect of workload or fatigue reduction among construction workers, and thus could help enhance productivity.

AB Global climate changes, especially the rise of global mean temperature due to the increased carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration, can, in turn, result in higher anthropogenic and biogenic greenhouse gas emissions. This potentially leads to a positive loop of climate-carbon feedback in the Earth's climate system, which calls for sustainable environmental strategies that can mitigate both heat and carbon emissions, such as urban greening. In this study, we investigate the impact of urban irrigation over green spaces on ambient temperatures and CO2 exchange across major cities in the contiguous United States. Our modeling results indicate that the carbon release from urban ecosystem respiration is reduced by evaporative cooling in humid climate, but promoted in arid/semi-arid regions due to increased soil moisture. The irrigation-induced environmental co-benefit in heat and carbon mitigation is, in general, positively correlated with urban greening fraction and has the potential to help counteract climate-carbon feedback in the built environment.
   This study shows that urban irrigation is capable of achieving the environmental co-benefit of heat mitigation and carbon neutrality and has the potential to counteract the climate-carbon feedback loop in the U.S. urban environment.

AB Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) is a promising approach to relieve workers from repetitive and physically demanding tasks and improve safety and productivity in construction. It is critical for robots to understand worker intention in order to adapt their motion to facilitate smooth HRC. Evidence has shown that visual attention reveals human intention. However, it is still unclear how visual attention is distributed in human-robot collaborative construction tasks. In this study, a pilot experiment was conducted to examine human visual attention in a wood assembly task with the assistance of a collaborative robot. A mobile eye tracker was used to collect participants' gaze movements. Data were validated and processed in terms of various metrics to analyze visual attention patterns. It is found that construction workers' visual attention is related to the detailed process of the task-around 30% of the eye gaze is located at the connector areas and the design drawing area, which is primarily relevant to their task. Furthermore, workers' attention could be affected by the movement of the robot, with their gaze following the path of robot arm and gripper during the collaboration. The findings can stimulate further research into attention-aware HRC for intelligent construction.

AB The advent of large language models has significantly influenced the development of artificial intelligence (AI), expanding its reach beyond researchers to the general public via practical tools. These models demonstrate remarkable capabilities in complex tasks but also present limitations and risks of misuse. In response, regulatory frameworks from the United States and the European Union have proposed measures to ensure AI safety, introducing notions such as Constitutional AI to ensure adherence to these guidelines. This special issue introduces and covers the following two interweaving research directions toward AI safety. First, civilizing AI to balance AI's ability to generate human-like outputs and mitigate adverse behaviors such as hallucinations and unintended biases, and second, humanizing AI to align AI systems' behavior with human ethics, sociocultural norms, values, and regulations, ensuring they meet societal expectations similar to those for human roles such as drivers or health professionals.

AB Mining spatiotemporal mobility patterns is crucial for optimizing urban planning, enhancing transportation systems, and improving public safety by providing useful insights into human movement and behavior over space and time. As an unsupervised learning technique, time series clustering has gained considerable attention due to its efficiency. However, the existing literature has often overlooked the inherent characteristics of mobility data, including high-dimensionality, noise, outliers, and time distortions. This oversight can lead to potentially large computational costs and inaccurate patterns. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel neural network-based method integrating temporal autoencoder and dynamic time warping-based K-means clustering algorithm to mutually promote each other for mining spatiotemporal mobility patterns. Comparative results showed that our proposed method outperformed several time series clustering techniques in accurately identifying mobility patterns on both synthetic and real-world data, which provides a reliable foundation for data-driven decision-making. Furthermore, we applied the method to monthly county-level mobility data during the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S., revealing significant differences in mobility changes between rural and urban areas, as well as the impact of public response and health considerations on mobility patterns.

AB Accurate and efficient numerical simulation of highly nonlinear ultrasound propagation is essential for a wide range of therapeutic and physical ultrasound applications. However, due to large domain sizes and the generation of higher harmonics, such simulations are computationally challenging, particularly in 3-D problems with shock waves. Current numerical methods are based on computationally inefficient uniform meshes that resolve the highest harmonics across the entire spatial domain. To address this challenge, we present an adaptive numerical algorithm for computationally efficient nonlinear acoustic holography. At each propagation step, the algorithm monitors the harmonic content of the acoustic signal and adjusts its discretization parameters accordingly. This enables efficient local resolution of higher harmonics in areas of high nonlinearity while avoiding unnecessary resolution elsewhere. Furthermore, the algorithm actively adapts to the signal's nonlinearity level, eliminating the need for prior reference simulations or information about the spatial distribution of the harmonic content of the acoustic field. The proposed algorithm incorporates an upsampling process in the frequency domain to accommodate the generation of higher harmonics in forward propagation and a downsampling process when higher harmonics are decimated in backward propagation. The efficiency of the algorithm was evaluated for highly nonlinear 3-D problems, demonstrating a significant reduction in computational cost with a nearly 50-fold speedup over a uniform mesh implementation. Our findings enable a more rapid and efficient approach to modeling nonlinear high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) wave propagation.

AB Modern Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) cloud platforms offer great potential for supporting event-driven scientific workflows. Nonetheless, there remain barriers to adoption by the scientific community in domains such as environmental sciences, where R is the focal language used for the development of applications and where users are typically not well-versed with FaaS APIs. This paper describes the design and implementation of FaaSr, a novel middleware system that supports event-driven scientific workflows in R. A key novelty in FaaSr is the ability to deploy workflows across FaaS providers without the need for any managed servers for coordination. With FaaSr: 1) functions are written in R; 2) the runtime environments for their execution are customizable containers; 3) functions access data in cloud storage (S3) with a familiar file-based abstraction supporting both full file put/get primitives and subsetting using the Parquet format; and 4) function invocation and workflow coordination only requires S3 cloud object storage, without relying on any dedicated, active workflow engine server or cloud-specific queues/databases. The paper reports on the functionality and performance of FaaSr for micro-benchmarks and two case studies: event-driven forecast and batch job workflows. These demonstrate the ability to deploy workflows across multiple platforms (GitHub Actions, Amazon Web Services Lambda, and the open-source OpenWhisk), without the need for dedicated coordination servers, across both cloud and edge resources. FaaSr is open-source and available as a CRAN package.

AB In Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) networks, Smart Meters (SMs), are installed at consumers' houses, provide electric utilities with fine-grained power consumption data necessary for accurate billing, load monitoring, and energy management. However, utility companies are still subjected to electricity theft cyber-attacks in which fraudulent consumers may manipulate their reported readings and hence reduce their bills. Several ML-based electricity theft detectors have been proposed in the literature, however, they either do not capture well the deeper periodicity and temporal features in energy consumption data or violate consumers' privacy by running these models over unencrypted power consumption data. To address these challenges, we propose in this paper a Conv-LSTM-based detector that integrates a 2-D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to significantly improve the model's functionality and detection accuracy, specifically addressing the inherent periodicity and temporal dependencies in electricity consumption data. Moreover, to run the proposed model over encrypted 2D data and preserve consumers' privacy, we designed a novel lightweight Inner Product Functional Encryption (IPFE) scheme that allows SMs to send their encrypted power consumption data to the Electric Utility (EU) which can securely compute the first feature map of the first convolutional layer of the Conv-LSTM detector while preserving consumer privacy. Our analysis and experiments demonstrate that our scheme is secure and efficiently detecting fraudulent consumers with minimal overhead. In specific, our model achieves a Detection Rate (DR) of 92.95%, a False Alarm Rate (FAR) of 3.68%, and a High Detection (HD) rate of 89.27%, resulting in an overall Accuracy (ACC) of 94.65%. Moreover, our scheme achieves high Precision (PR) at 98.80% and a robust Area Under the Curve (AUC) value of 98.50%. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing both detection accuracy and reliability all while protecting consumers' privacy.

AB With the advancement and boom of autonomous vehicles, vehicular digital twins (VDTs) have become an emerging research area. VDT can solve the issues related to autonomous vehicles and provide improved and enhanced services to users. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of using priorities in acquiring improved response time. However, since VDT is comprised of intra-twin and inter-twin communication, it leads to a reduced response time as traffic congestion grows, which causes issues in the form of accidents. It would be encouraging if priorities could be used in inter-twin communication of VDT for data sharing and processing tasks. Moreover, it would also be effective for managing the communication overhead on the digital twin layer of the cloud. This paper proposes a novel priority-based inter-twin communication in VDT to address this issue. We formulate the problem for priorities of digital twins and applications according to their categories. In addition, we describe the priority-based inter-twin communication in VDT in detail, and algorithms for priority communication for intra-twin and inter-twin are designed, respectively. Finally, experiments on different priority tasks are conducted and compared with two existing algorithms, demonstrating our proposed algorithm's effectiveness and efficiency.

AB In recent years, immense developments have occurred in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the spread of broadband and ubiquitous connectivity technologies. This has led to the development and commercialization of Digital Twin (DT) technology. The widespread adoption of DT has resulted in a new network paradigm called Digital Twin Networks (DTNs), which orchestrate through the networks of ubiquitous DTs and their corresponding physical assets. DTNs create virtual twins of physical objects via DT technology and realize the co-evolution between physical and virtual spaces through data processing, computing, and DT modeling. The high volume of user data and the ubiquitous communication systems in DTNs come with their own set of challenges. The most serious issue here is with respect to user data privacy and security because users of most applications are unaware of the data that they are sharing with these platforms and are naive in understanding the implications of the data breaches. Also, currently, there is not enough literature that focuses on privacy and security issues in DTN applications. In this survey, we first provide a clear idea of the components of DTNs and the common metrics used in literature to assess their performance. Next, we offer a standard network model that applies to most DTN applications to provide a better understanding of DTN's complex and interleaved communications and the respective components. We then shed light on the common applications where DTNs have been adapted heavily and the privacy and security issues arising from the DTNs. We also provide different privacy and security countermeasures to address the previously mentioned issues in DTNs and list some state-of-the-art tools to mitigate the issues. Finally, we provide some open research issues and problems in the field of DTN privacy and security. (c) 2024 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Shandong University.

AB The construction industry has been male-dominated for a long time and has struggled with diversity and inclusion in the workforce, especially for construction equipment operators with only 2.7% of women. Meanwhile, the construction industry is also currently facing the emergence of new technologies such as construction robots. This trend may offer new opportunities for increasing diversity and inclusion in the workforce, but it also poses the risk of exacerbating existing inequities without a well-designed transformation process of hiring and performance evaluation. This study aims to examine the current state of hiring and performance evaluation practices for equipment operators and identify the barriers and challenges to creating a more diverse and inclusive workforce, especially in the context of the incorporation of construction robots. Specifically, through content analysis of job posters and a series of interviews with industry professionals, this study identifies the reasons that prevent women from entering this occupation, the existing barriers, and the potential impacts of emerging technology adoptions on workforce diversity. The findings of this study provide valuable insights for the construction industry to build a more diverse and inclusive workforce in the technology transformation process.

AB Robotic teleoperation is regarded as a promising method of assisting workers in performing construction activities while avoiding potentially dangerous conditions. However, the control interface of conventional teleoperation systems relies on physical devices, such as a keyboard and joystick, to input control commands, which cannot be intuitively mapped to robot movement, and thus affecting the teleoperation performance of non-expert users. In this research, we present a novel human-robot interface to map human arm movement to robotic arm motion for intuitive teleoperation. Firstly, the human arm is tracked in real-time through a motion capturing system, that is, OptiTrack. The 3D location data is then streamed to robot operating system (ROS) and is used for motion planning of the robotic arm in MoveIt. Finally, the interface is demonstrated in a teleoperated pick-and-place task through robotic simulation, and the usability of the developed framework is compared to that of a joystick-based teleoperation system.

AB This paper presents an investigation of a fluidic-based impedance biosensor for rapid and accurate detection of Salmonella Typhimurium in raw chicken carcass rinsate. The biosensor is engineered with multiple distinct regions that concentrates Salmonella antigens to a detectable level, subsequently trapping the concentrated Salmonella samples on top of the detection interdigitated electrode array coated with a specific Salmonella antibody, maximizing the number of captured antigens. Detection is achieved through the antibody-antigen binding process, where binding events changes impedance values, providing a reliable method for identifying and quantifying Salmonella. The biosensor demonstrated a low limit of detection (LOD) of 1-2 cells/ml within 40-50 min. The findings demonstrated that the biosensor distinguishes low concentrations of live Salmonella cells, even in the presence of high concentrations of dead Salmonella cells, and non-specific binding pathogens viz., Listeria monocytogenes and E. coli O157:H7.

AB This study investigates the equi-energetic low-velocity impact (LVI) and compression after impact (CAI) response of tubular CFRP structures. Various layups and geometries are employed to understand the effects of impact energy, configurations, and damage on the CAI behavior. Low mass-high velocity (LMHV) impact results in greater absorbed energy than high mass-low velocity (HMLV). Impact damage formation, especially circumferentially, significantly affects CAI strength. Braided tubes show higher impact resistance, but weaker compressive strength compared to unidirectional/twill tubes. A new analytical model provides accurate prediction of CAI strength. This study emphasizes the importance of impact energy and lay-up configurations in CFRP design.

AB Underground pipeline strikes, a pressing problem due to inaccurate subsurface data, are addressed in this paper with a pipeline detection and localization framework. First, abundant radargrams are generated to relieve radargram data shortage by simulating Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) scans along the urban roadway and enhancing their realism with Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) technique. Second, a deep learning network is designed to directly reconstruct permittivity maps from radargrams for accurate pipeline detection and characterization, instead of detecting pipeline features within the radargram. Third, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is employed for GPR position estimation, enabling precise georegistration of pipelines. The proposed method attains an R-squared (R2 15) value of 0.957 in permittivity map reconstruction and 96.2% precision in pipeline detection. Additionally, it provides satisfactory performance with a deviation of 1.71% in depth and 20.44% in diameter for the detected pipelines. Real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, highlighting its potential to prevent excavation accidents, reduce project delays, and offer significant benefits to utility companies, contractors, and urban planners

AB Asset tracking is increasingly necessary for better management of offsite and onsite construction progress for modular construction projects. Delayed delivery of elements from prefabricated plants would postpone the construction progress, resulting in economic losses, disputes, and change orders. To certify these works transparently and precisely, a tamperproof digital asset tracking system is important. Blockchain can be the potential solution due to the immutability and trustworthiness of its record, while building information modeling (BIM)-based digital twins can provide rich semantic information on building assets. However, current studies have not achieved sufficient collaboration for automatic asset tracking and change visualization. To address the limitation, this paper proposes an integrated BIM-based blockchain framework based on smart contracts. First, assets and their semantic information, as well as construction schedule with the dependency among their relevant activities, are automatically transmitted from BIM to the blockchain, where corresponding QR codes are generated to attach physical assets. As their physical tracking data are updated in the blockchain, if any delay, the potential changes will be automatically propagated to all affected activities by executing compiled smart contracts. Once stakeholders certify these changes, the affected activities with corresponding assets are automatically visualized in the 4D environment for timely notification and collaboration. We also develop a prototype system to validate this framework's feasibility in a trusted and traceable way.

AB Although many collisional orogens form after subduction of oceanic lithosphere between two continents, some orogens result from strain localization within a continent via inversion of structures inherited from continental rifting. Intracontinental rift -inversion orogens exhibit a range of structural styles, but the underlying causes of such variability have not been extensively explored. We use numerical models of intracontinental rift inversion to investigate the impact of parameters including rift structure, rift duration, post -rift cooling, and convergence velocity on orogen structure. Our models reproduce the natural variability of rift -inversion orogens and can be categorized using three endmember styles: asymmetric underthrusting (AU), distributed thickening (DT), and localized polarity flip (PF). Inversion of narrow rifts tends to produce orogens with more localized deformation (styles AU and PF) than those resulting from wide rifts. However, multiple combinations of the parameters we investigated can produce the same structural style. Thus, our models indicate no unique relationship between orogenic structure and the conditions prior to and during inversion. Because the style of rift -inversion orogenesis is highly contingent upon the rift history prior to inversion, knowing the geologic history that preceded rift inversion is essential for translating orogenic structure into the processes that produced that structure.

AB The adoption of collaborative robots in construction is one major step toward achieving intelligent and automated construction to improve productivity and safety. Many construction tasks require physical human-robot collaboration (HRC), where workers and robots collaborate side-by-side in a common workspace. Such close-distance interactions may cause worker resistance, hindering successful HRC implementation. This study aims to understand workers' acceptance of HRC via experimental studies. Experiments on human-robot collaborative wood assembly were performed, where participants were tasked to connect wood pieces, and a robot was programmed to place pieces according to design. Two designs with different complexity levels were given. Surveys adapted from technology acceptance model were collected before and after the experiments to investigate individual perceptions and acceptance of robots. The results show that gender and complexity of tasks have a great impact on the acceptance of robots. Finally, the implications for the future development of HRC in construction were discussed.

AB Asset tracking is crucial for managing prefabricated construction projects, as delayed deliveries might disrupt interdependent offsite and onsite activities, causing economic losses and disputes. To clarify liabilities, tamperproof asset tracking and delay propagation analysis are necessary. To achieve this, a BIM-blockchain integrated framework via smart contracts is proposed given rich information in BIM and blockchain's immutable records. First, asset information and interdependent activity schedule are automatically transmitted from BIM to blockchain. Then, QR codes are generated and attached to physical assets for tracking. If any delays, compiled smart contracts will automatically derive propagated impacts on offsite and onsite activities considering their interdependencies and proactively notify relevant parties. Affected activities with assets, certification time, and responsible parties are automatically visualized in 4D BIM for timely collaboration. The developed IFCEthereum prototype demonstrates the framework's feasibility and effectiveness, reducing coordination overhead costs and time. Traceable records help further calculate parties' penalties and compensation.

AB Advances in robotics enable the implementation of collaborative robots in hazardous, repetitive, and demanding construction tasks to improve safety and productivity. Accurate and reliable human motion prediction is required to achieve smooth human-robot collaboration (HRC). However, many deep-learning-based models only consider observed movement to predict human motion while neglecting the interactions between humans and their surroundings. This study proposes a context-aware deep learning model, integrating observed movement and context information (i.e., locations of assigned tasks) into a long short-term memory network with an encoder-decoder architecture to predict a sequence of human motion in 3D. A pilot experiment was conducted, and the proposed model achieves an average displacement error of 0.15 m. The results show that incorporating task contextual information improves the accuracy of human motion prediction by 6.25%, which could augment the perception and reasoning capability of collaborative robots for improved HRC in construction.

AB Conducting survival analysis on distributed healthcare data is an important research problem, as privacy laws and emerging data-sharing regulations prohibit the sharing of sensitive patient data across multiple institutions. The distributed healthcare survival data often exhibit heterogeneity, non-uniform censoring and involve patients with multiple health conditions (competing risks), which can result in biased and unreliable risk predictions. To address these challenges, we propose employing federated learning (FL) for survival analysis with competing risks. In this work, we present two main contributions. Firstly, we propose a simple algorithm for estimating consistent federated pseudo values (FPV) for survival analysis with competing risks and censoring. Secondly, we introduce a novel and flexible FPV-based deep learning framework named Fedora, which jointly trains our proposed transformer-based model, TransPseudo, specific to the participating institutions (clients) within the Fedora framework without accessing clients' data, thus, preserving data privacy. We conducted extensive experiments on both real-world distributed healthcare datasets characterized by non-IID and non-uniform censoring properties, as well as synthetic data with various censoring settings. Our results demonstrate that our Fedora framework with the TransPseudo model performs better than the federated learning frameworks employing state-of-the-art survival models for competing risk analysis.

AB CyberGIS-geographic information science and systems (GIS) based on advanced cyberinfrastructure-is becoming increasingly important to tackling a variety of socio-environmental problems like climate change, disaster management, and water security. While recent advances in high-performance computing (HPC) have the potential to help address these problems, the technical knowledge required to use HPC has posed challenges to many domain experts. In this paper, we present CyberGIS-Compute: a geospatial middleware tool designed to democratize HPC access for solving diverse socio-environmental problems. CyberGIS-Compute does this by providing a simple user interface in Jupyter, streamlining the process of integrating domain-specific models with HPC, and establishing a suite of APIs friendly to domain experts.

AB Emerging connected vehicular services, such as intelligent driving and high-definition (HD) map, are gaining increasing interest with the fast development of multi-access edge computing (MEC). For most time-sensitive and computation-intensive vehicular services, the data offloading process significantly influences the capacity and performance of MEC, especially when the number of connected vehicles is enormous. In this work, we consider data offloading optimization for a large-scale automotive MEC network. The problem is challenging due to the large number of connected vehicles and the complicated interaction between vehicles and edge servers. To tackle the scalability problem, we reformulate the original offloading optimization problem into a Mean-Field-Game (MFG) problem by abstracting the interaction among the connected vehicles as a distribution over their state spaces of task sizes, known as the mean-field term. To solve the problem efficiently, we propose a G-prox Primal-Dual-Hybrid-Gradient (PDHG) algorithm that transforms the MFG problem into a saddle-point problem. Based on our developed MFG model and G-prox PDHG algorithm, we propose the first data offloading scheme whose computation time is independent of the number of connected vehicles in automotive MEC systems. Extensive evaluation results corroborate the superior performance of our proposed scheme compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

AB Demand for water- and oil-repellent-coated paper as an alternative to plastics is growing, but the challenge is that coated paper lacks concurrent recyclability and biodegradability. Reported herein is a novel carboxylic acid-functionalized poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (CPBAT) copolymer investigated for recyclable and repulpable water-borne paper coatings. The CPBAT synthesized here is characterized by spectroscopic methods. Paper coated with waterborne CPBAT exhibited excellent water, oil, moisture, and gas barrier properties suitable for packaging applications. The recyclability and repulpability of the CPBAT-coated paper are successfully validated via certified TAPPI methods. This work demonstrates the first successful preparation of coated paper that is per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)-free, recyclable, and biodegradable, with significant benefits for the environment and human health.

AB Quantitative approaches to conflict research are evolving to incorporate better theoretical, methodical, and dataset tools. One key area where our progress is especially limited relates to the social origins of rebel groups: how a group's political identity emerges as a focal point for mobilization and future conflict behaviors. We benchmark two key empirical agendas in civil war and rebellion research and then discuss key contributions of this special issue. In bringing together multiple theoretical perspectives and original datasets, including the individual-level and group-level data, the contributions to this special feature push the research frontier further along these lines. Jointly, they demonstrate that a rebel group's origins - where it comes from, who are its constituents, what is its political appeal, and how it organizes - have far-reaching implications to explanations along different dimensions and across a wide range of contexts and regions.

AB AI recommendations influence our daily decisions. The convenience of navigating personalized content goes hand-in-hand with the notorious filter bubble effect, which may decrease people's exposure to diverse options and opinions. Children are especially vulnerable to this due to their limited AI literacy and critical thinking skills. In this study, we propose a novel Augmented Reality (AR) application BeeTrap. It aims to not only raise children's awareness of filter bubbles but also empower them to mitigate this ethical issue through sense-making of AI recommendation systems' inner workings. By having children experience and break filter bubbles in a flower recommendation system, BeeTrap utilizes embodied metaphors (e.g., NEAR-FAR, ITERATION) and analogies (bee pollination) to bridge abstract AI concepts with sensory-motor experiences in familiar STEM contexts. To evaluate our design's effectiveness and accessibility for a broad range of children, we introduced BeeTrap in a four-day summer camp for middle-school students from underrepresented backgrounds in STEM. Results from pre- and post-tests and interviews show that BeeTrap developed students' technical understanding of AI recommendations, empowered them to break filter bubbles, and helped them foster new personal and societal perspectives around AI technologies.

TI Model-based motion planning in POMDPs with temporal logic specifications

   automaton; reinforcement learning; deep q-learning
AB Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) have been used as mathematical models for sequential decision-making under uncertain and incomplete information. Since the state space is partially observable in a POMDP, the agent has to make a decision based on the integrated information over the past experiences of actions and observations. This study aims to solve probabilistic motion planning problems in which the agent is assigned a complex task under a partially observable environment. We employ linear temporal logic (LTL) to formulate the complex task and then convert it to a limit-deterministic generalized Buchi automaton (LDGBA). We reformulate the problem as finding an optimal policy on the product of POMDP and LDGBA based on model-checking techniques. This paper adopts and modifies two reinforcement learning (RL) approaches: value iteration and deep Q-learning. Both are model-based because the optimal policy is a function of belief states that need transition and observation probabilities to be updated. We illustrate the applicability of the proposed methods by addressing two simulations, including a grid-world problem with various sizes and a TurtleBot office path planning problem.

AB We explore neutrino emission from nonrotating, single-star models across six initial metallicities and 70 initial masses from the zero-age main sequence to the final fate. Overall, across the mass spectrum, we find metal-poor stellar models tend to have denser, hotter, and more massive cores with lower envelope opacities, larger surface luminosities, and larger effective temperatures than their metal-rich counterparts. Across the mass-metallicity plane we identify the sequence (initial CNO -> 14N -> 22Ne -> 25Mg -> 26Al -> 26Mg -> 30P -> 30Si) as making primary contributions to the neutrino luminosity at different phases of evolution. For the low-mass models we find neutrino emission from the nitrogen flash and thermal pulse phases of evolution depend strongly on the initial metallicity. For the high-mass models, neutrino emission at He-core ignition and He-shell burning depends strongly on the initial metallicity. Antineutrino emission during C, Ne, and O burning shows a strong metallicity dependence with 22Ne(alpha, n)25Mg providing much of the neutron excess available for inverse-beta decays. We integrate the stellar tracks over an initial mass function and time to investigate the neutrino emission from a simple stellar population. We find average neutrino emission from simple stellar populations to be 0.5-1.2 MeV electron neutrinos. Lower metallicity stellar populations produce slightly larger neutrino luminosities and average beta decay energies. This study can provide targets for neutrino detectors from individual stars and stellar populations. We provide convenient fitting formulae and open access to the photon and neutrino tracks for more sophisticated population synthesis models.

AB Generative AI models can produce high-quality images based on text prompts. The generated images often appear indistinguishable from images generated by conventional optical photography devices or created by human artists (i.e., real images). While the outstanding performance of such generative models is generally well received, security concerns arise. For instance, such image generators could be used to facilitate fraud or scam schemes, generate and spread misinformation, or produce fabricated artworks. In this paper, we present a systematic attempt at understanding and detecting AI-generated images (AI-art) in adversarial scenarios. First, we collect and share a dataset of real images and their corresponding artificial counterparts generated by four popular AI image generators. The dataset, named ARIA, contains over 140K images in five categories: artworks (painting), social media images, news photos, disaster scenes, and anime pictures. This dataset can be used as a foundation to support future research on adversarial AI-art. Next, we present a user study that employs the ARIA dataset to evaluate if real-world users can distinguish with or without reference images. In a benchmarking study, we further evaluate if state-of-the-art open-source and commercial AI image detectors can effectively identify the images in the ARIA dataset. Finally, we present a ResNet-50 classifier and evaluate its accuracy and transferability on the ARIA dataset. The ARIA dataset and the project source code are shared at: https://github.com/AdvAIArtProject/AdvAIArt.

AB Civil engineers design buildings, roads, and utility pipelines in the Arctic to rest on firm frozen ground. But as permafrost thaws due to increased air temperature, the ground subsides and infrastructure fails. This paper assesses the current tools used for mapping Arctic geohazard for civil infrastructure planning in the warming Arctic. We formulate an integrated framework to inform science-based decisions and policymaking in response to the ongoing environmental changes. This study first conducts a systematic review of the Arctic geohazard mapping tools. Tools used for Arctic geohazard mapping fall into three categories: analytical or statistical equations for geohazard assessment, modeling approaches for predicting the extent of permafrost degradation, and remote and in-situ sensing for monitoring the natural and built environments and data collection. A description of these tools, along with their limitations and applicability, is provided. Co-production of knowledge is important in developing a robust geohazard assessment tool. Based on the scientific and gray literature, however, we find that the literature of the use of knowledge co-production in the development of evaluation tools outside of health care and public governance is highly sparse. Through the review of Arctic geohazard mapping tools, we provide an integrated framework for Arctic high spatial-resolution multi-geohazards evaluation for civil infrastructure planning. Indigenous knowledge and local observations are included in the proposed framework.

AB The integration of a decentralized home energy management system (HEMS) marks a pivotal advancement in the pursuit of enhanced energy efficiency and sustainability within modern households. While numerous studies focus on developing efficient and innovative programs from technical perspectives, the willingness of individuals to adopt these systems is equally crucial for achieving widespread adoption and ultimately creating a more energy-efficient society. Based on a large-scale online survey with 1,196 participants in California in 2021, we investigated the intentions related to the adoption of decentralized HEMS, particularly considering demand flexibility encompassing both air-conditioning (AC) and electric vehicles (EV) control, specifically focusing on socio-demographic disparities. Our analysis found greater openness for allowing HEMS to control AC usage compared to scheduling EV charging, possibly due to immediate comfort needs or trust in AC predictability. Lowincome households showed less flexibility in adjusting both AC and EVs, while high-income households were less likely to decrease EV charging. Furthermore, homeowners exhibited greater flexibility compared to renters. Disparities between different racial backgrounds in EV charging time-shifting were more pronounced than in AC aspects. Our findings indicated that vulnerable populations may lack the flexibility and resources necessary to shift their energy consumption patterns effectively, potentially amplifying energy-related disparities and exacerbating their energy burden. Policy recommendations highlight the need for multifaceted approaches in addressing demand flexibility and energy management, especially with emerging technologies like EVs, to ensure equitable strategies for promoting sustainable energy practices across diverse communities.

AB All -solid-state batteries (ASSBs) have potential to provide higher specific energy, higher power, and longer cycle life than Li -ion batteries (LIBs) for continuously increasing demands of high-performance rechargeable batteries with intrinsic safety. However, one of the barriers for successful design and fabrication of ASSBs is the lack of solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) that can meet multi -functional requirements for ASSBs. To address this issue, the present study investigates hydrothermal synthesis of amorphous and crystalline Ba-doped Li 3 OCl solid electrolytes and develops the understanding of the relationships between the synthesis conditions and electrochemical properties of the products. It is shown that the formation of an amorphous/crystalline Ba-doped Li 3 OCl mixture with little hydroxide impurities depends strongly on the hydrothermal reaction temperature, drying temperature, Ba concentration, and rate of removing OH - and H + ions as steam from water solvated Ba-doped Li 3 OCl. The key to generate amorphous Li 3 OCl-based electrolytes with high ionic conductivities (7.65 x 10 -3 S/cm) at room temperature is to create non -equilibrium synthesis conditions such as the one identified in this study. The understanding developed in this study will offer critical guidelines for synthesizing amorphous and crystalline Li 3 OCl-based electrolytes with superior electrochemical properties for ASSBs reliably and reproducibly in the near future.

ID PROGRESS
AB The demand for high-energy-density batteries has prompted exploration into advanced materials for enhancing the safety and performance of lithium metal batteries (LMBs). This study introduces a novel approach, incorporating two-dimensional (2D) pyrazine and imine-linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) into a polyethylene oxide (PEO)-based solid electrolyte matrix. The synthesized COFs act as multifunctional additives, improving mechanical strength, ionic conductivity (reaching 1.86 x10- 3 S/cm at room temperature), electrochemical window (oxidation resistance up to 5 V vs. Li/Li+), and thermal stability (up to 400 degrees C). The unique electron-rich and polar functionalities of pyrazine and imine linkages facilitate strong interactions with lithium ions (Li+), resulting in a flexible composite solid electrolyte that mitigates dendrite formation and interface instability. Electrochemical performance of LMBs with LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811) cathode further confirm the enhanced Li+ conductivity, prolonged cycling stability, and a stable solid electrolyte interface, showcasing the potential of COFs in improving LMB performance. Overall, this study highlights the promising role of pyrazine and imine-linked COFs as effective additives for polymer-based solid electrolytes and their potential for developing safer and more efficient LMBs in the future.

TI Deep Learning and Blockchain-Driven Contract Theory: Alleviate Gender
   Bias in Construction
SO JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID MANAGEMENT; INTERNET
AB In the construction industry, the advent of teleoperation and robotic technologies is revolutionizing traditional recruitment practices, introducing new criteria for identifying qualified workers. This evolution presents significant challenges for employers aiming to recruit workers who can maximize organizational utility. Although contract theory offers a promising solution to these challenges, its inherent self-disclosure property could inadvertently lead to privacy breaches, such as revealing gender-related information. Such disclosure risk might intensify existing biases, notably gender bias, within the sector. To this end, we proposed deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based contract theory. Firstly, the trained DRL model will produce unpredictable contract bundles, restricting employers' access to workers' privacy. Subsequently, to ensure employers adopt DRL-based contract theory, we utilized blockchain to supervise contract bundle generation. Finally, given that the DRL models are homogenous among employers, we integrated transfer learning to reduce unnecessary overhead. Simulation experiments conducted using US labor force statistical data demonstrated that our work can effectively mitigate potential gender bias by augmenting the contract selection rights for female workers from 72.73% and 60% to 96.97% and 95% in comparison with traditional contract theory while maximizing employers' utility. In addition, with the integration of transfer learning, the training overhead of DRL-based contract theory can decrease by 50%. The meaning and significance of the results lie in the innovative integration of contract theory, deep reinforcement learning, and transfer learning into the recruitment framework, significantly advancing the body of knowledge in unbiased workforce development.

AB Long-range Wide Area Network (LoRAWAN) is one of the most widely used low-power wide-area network technologies for enabling long-range and extensive coverage for Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems. The network performance and sustainability metrics are crucial to effectively and efficiently implementing such IoT ecosystems. However, existing broadcasting protocols (e.g., ECHO) typically suffer from high collision rates and low network throughput when deployed in the IoT domain and, thus, may adversely impact the network performance. Therefore, a key objective in designing broadcast routing protocols in IoT is to increase the packet delivery success rate while reducing the packet collision rate. In this paper, we present an efficient rebroadcast location-unaware protocol for LoRaWAN mesh networks in the IoT domain. The proposed protocol dynamically adjusts the rebroadcast delay (i.e., timing) based on the network conditions. We in-depth analyzed the critical performance parameters (i.e., rebroadcast delay, packet size, and re-transmission strategy) that influence LoRaWAN mesh networks in various IoT environments operating in a low-data-rate context. As a result, we identified the causes of higher collision rates and, consequently, low network throughput in such a context. Experimental results showed that our protocol outperformed the ECHO protocol regarding the packet collision rate and energy efficiency.

AB Ethical AI has become increasingly important, and it has been attracting attention from academia and industry, due to its increased popularity in real-world applications with fairness concerns. It also places fundamental importance on ethical considerations in determining legitimate and illegitimate uses of AI. Organizations that apply ethical AI have clearly stated well-defined review processes to ensure adherence to legal guidelines. Therefore, the wave of research at the intersection of ethical AI in data mining and machine learning has also influenced other fields of science, including computer vision, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, and social science. Despite these successes, ethical AI still faces many challenges, such as lack of interpretable and explainable methods for fairness-aware deep learning models, etc. Consequently, there is an urgent need to bring experts and researchers together at prestigious venues to discuss ethical AI, which has been rarely seen in previous KDD conferences. This workshop will provide a premium platform for both research and industry from different backgrounds to exchange ideas on opportunities, challenges, and cutting-edge techniques in ethical AI.

AB Utilizing a discrete choice experiment with 250 US electricity consumers, this study estimates willingness to pay (WTP) for each percentage increase in carbon dioxide captured and the preferred carbon management technique -permanent storage or industrial utilization. Results from an alternative-specific conditional logit model suggest a WTP of $0.13 for each percent increase in carbon capture, and an additional $5-$6 per month for industrial utilization over storage. In contrast, the estimated WTP for each percent increase in renewable energy is $0.25, suggesting that consumers value renewable energy nearly twice as much as carbon capture. These preliminary results indicate some preference for carbon capture, though not as strong as for cleaner energy, with a clearer preference for carbon utilization than storage. Further research is recommended to investigate variations in these preferences based on individual characteristics.

   regulatory neural network
SO BIOPHYSICAL REPORTS

ID ESCHERICHIA-COLI
AB The gene regulatory network (GRN) of biological cells governs a number of key functionalities that enable them to adapt and survive through different environmental conditions. Close observation of the GRN shows that the structure and operational principles resemble an artificial neural network (ANN), which can pave the way for the development of wet-neuromorphic computing systems. Genes are integrated into gene-perceptrons with transcription factors (TFs) as input, where the TF concentration relative to half-maximal RNA concentration and gene product copy number influences transcription and translation via weighted multiplication before undergoing a nonlinear activation function. This process yields protein concentration as the output, effectively turning the entire GRN into a gene regulatory neural network (GRNN). In this paper, we establish nonlinear classifiers for molecular machine learning using the inherent sigmoidal nonlinear behavior of gene expression. The eigenvalue-based stability analysis, tailored to system parameters, confirms maximum-stable concentration levels, minimizing concentration fluctuations and computational errors. Given the significance of the stabilization phase in GRNN computing and the dynamic nature of the GRN, alongside potential changes in system parameters, we utilize the Lyapunov stability theorem for temporal stability analysis. Based on this GRN-to-GRNN mapping and stability analysis, three classifiers are developed utilizing two generic multilayer sub-GRNNs and a sub-GRNN extracted from the Escherichia coli GRN. Our findings also reveal the adaptability of different sub-GRNNs to suit different application requirements.

AB During the global COVID-19 pandemic, people utilized social media platforms, especially Twitter, to spread and express opinions about the pandemic. Such discussions also drove the rise in COVID-related offensive speech. In this work, focusing on Twitter, we present a comprehensive analysis of COVID-related offensive tweets and their targets. We collected a COVID-19 dataset with over 747 million tweets for 30 months and fine-tuned a BERT classifier to detect offensive tweets. Our offensive tweets analysis shows that the ebb and flow of COVID-related offensive tweets potentially reflect events in the physical world. We then studied the targets of these offensive tweets. There was a large number of offensive tweets with abusive words, which could negatively affect the targeted groups or individuals. We also conducted a user network analysis, and found that offensive users interact more with other offensive users and that the pandemic had a lasting impact on some offensive users. Our study offers novel insights into the persistence and evolution of COVID-related offensive tweets during the pandemic.

AB Learning to hash has become popular for video retrieval due to its fast speed and low storage consumption. Previous efforts formulate video hashing as training a binary auto-encoder, for which noncontinuous latent representations are optimized by the biased straight-through (ST) back-propagation heuristic. We propose to formulate video hashing as learning a discrete variational auto-encoder with the factorized Bernoulli latent distribution, termed as Bernoulli variational auto-encoder (BerVAE). The corresponding evidence lower bound (ELBO) in our BerVAE implementation leads to closed-form gradient expression, which can be applied to achieve principled training along with some other unbiased gradient estimators. BerVAE enables uncertainty-aware video hashing by predicting the probability distribution of video hash code-words, thus providing reliable uncertainty quantification. Experiments on both simulated and real-world large-scale video data demonstrate that our BerVAE trained with unbiased gradient estimators can achieve the state-of-the-art retrieval performance. Furthermore, we show that quantified uncertainty is highly correlated to video retrieval performance, which can be leveraged to further improve the retrieval accuracy.

AB To achieve net-zero emission in America by 2050, high voltage transmission capacity must expand similar to 60% by 2030 and triple by 2050 to connect further wind and solar facilities to demand. This expansion requires a capital investment in transmission capacity of $ 360 billion by 2030 and $2.4 trillion by 2050. Considering the high cost of building transmission lines, innovations toward high-capacity overhead lines have been targeted to reduce the number of transmission lines required. In our previous studies, we introduced unconventional high-capacity transmission lines. To realize these novel transmission lines, various aspects of line design should be studied, and this paper addresses determining the location and number of shield wires to protect these novel lines against lightning strikes. Lightning-induced overvoltage across line insulators is one of the key factors in power system outages. The design meets the shielding failure flashover rate (SFFOR) <= 0.05/100 km-years for all three phases of the unconventional high-capacity transmission line. Brown-Whitehead equations were used to measure and analyze the striking distance for vertical strokes.

AB Cardiomyocytes are viscoelastic and contribute significantly to right ventricle (RV) mechanics. Microtubule, a cytoskeletal protein, has been shown to regulate cardiomyocyte viscoelasticity. Additionally, hypertrophied cardiomyocytes from failing myocardium have increased microtubules and cell stiffness. How the microtubules contribute to the tissue-level viscoelastic behavior in RV failure remains unknown. Our aim was to investigate the role of the microtubules in the passive anisotropic viscoelasticity of the RV free wall (RVFW) during pulmonary hypertension (PH) progression. Equibiaxial stress relaxation tests were conducted in the RVFW from healthy and PH rats under early (6%) and end (15%) diastolic strains, and at sub- (1Hz) and physiological (5Hz) stretch-rates. The RVFW viscoelasticity was also measured before and after the depolymerization of microtubules at 5Hz. In intact tissues, PH increased RV viscosity and elasticity at both stretch rates and strain levels, and the increase was stronger in the circumferential than longitudinal direction. At 6% of strain, the removal of microtubules reduced elasticity, viscosity, and the ratio of viscosity to elasticity in both directions and for both healthy and diseased RVs. However, at 15% of strain, the effect of microtubules was different between groups - both viscosity and elasticity were reduced in healthy RVs, but in the diseased RVs only the circumferential viscosity and the ratio of viscosity to elasticity were reduced. These data suggest that, at a large strain with collagen recruitment, microtubules play more significant roles in healthy RV tissue elasticity and diseased RV tissue viscosity. Our findings suggest cardiomyocyte cytoskeletons are critical to RV passive viscoelasticity under pressure overload.

AB This paper introduces a new 17-bus 500 kV test system that has been specially designed to support transmission expansion planning studies. Unlike other test systems that have been developed for power system analysis, this system is unique because it focuses exclusively on transmission expansion planning at high voltage levels. Existing test systems that are used for TEP studies, in combination with electricity market problems or for integrating new generation or loads, tend to consider the system operations only under normal conditions and one loading condition. However, in practical scenarios, the system must be able to operate under different loading conditions and single contingencies to ensure reliability. Therefore, a reliable test system should mimic the behavior of a real power system, operating under both normal and all single contingency conditions for different loading conditions. This paper addresses this need by introducing a 17-bus 500 kV test system that can operate successfully under three different loading conditions (peak load, dominant load - 60% of peak load, and light load - 40% of peak load), while also being able to handle the operation at normal and single contingency conditions in each case.

AB Corona discharges cause power loss, audible noise (AN), radio interference (RI), and television interference (TVI), all of which should be considered during transmission line design. Unconventional high surge impedance loading (HSIL) lines have been shown to have the potential to produce greater natural power than conventional lines and conventional HSIL lines. More than one conductor is used in conventional extra high voltage (EHV) lines, typically more than 300 kV, to form bundled conductors which reduce the electrical field on the subconductors and, as a result, reduce corona effects. In conventional lines, the number of subconductors symmetrically placed on a circle and bundle radius are determined based on corona effects considerations. Using a larger bundle circle and increasing the number of subconductors lead to greater natural power, resulting in conventional HSIL lines. Therefore, in conventional HSIL lines, bundled conductors are used not only to address corona effects but also to increase natural power. Using smaller conductors for conventional HSIL lines keeps costs close to conventional lines. In conventional HSIL lines, subconductors are still symmetrically placed on a circle while unconventional HSIL lines have subconductors placed at any point in space. Unconventional HSIL lines can lead to more natural power than conventional HSIL lines. In this paper, AN and RI for unconventional HSIL lines are calculated and discussed.

ID RENEWABLE ENERGY
AB This paper presents an extra-high voltage synthetic test system that consists of 500 kV and 765 kV voltage levels, specifically designed for transmission expansion planning (TEP) studies. The test network includes long transmission lines whose series impedance and shunt admittance are calculated using the equivalent pi circuit model, accurately reflecting the distributed nature of the line parameters. The proposed test system offers technically feasible steady-state operation under normal and all single contingency conditions. By incorporating accurate modeling for long transmission lines and EHV voltage levels, the test system provides a realistic platform for validating models and theories prior to their application in actual power systems. It supports testing new algorithms, control strategies, and grid management techniques, aids in transmission expansion planning and investment decisions, and facilitates comprehensive grid evaluations. Moreover, a TEP study is conducted on this test system and various scenarios are evaluated and compared economically.

AB Feedstock from locally-sourced, recycled Ti-6Al-4V (Ti64) swarf is a low-cost alternative to atomized powder and encourages circular additive manufacturing. This study investigates the feasibility of Ti64 swarf as feedstock for laser directed energy deposition (L-DED) additive manufacturing. Ti64 swarf was recycled and ball- milled into irregular-shaped powder and compared to spherical plasma-atomized powder in powder flow, melt flow, and resulting microstructure. In situ monitoring showed that plasma-atomized powder had laminar flow during deposition and that ball-milled swarf powder had turbulent flow. Plasma-atomized powder caused steady melt pool dynamics and acicular microstructure. Ball-milled swarf powder caused melt pool fluctuation and equiaxed microstructure. (c) 2024 The Author(s).

ID VISUALIZATION
AB Ranking schemes drive many real-world decisions, like, where to study, whom to hire, what to buy, etc. Many of these decisions often come with high consequences. For example, a university can be deemed less prestigious if not featured in a top-k list, and consumers might not even explore products that do not get recommended to buyers. At the heart of most of these decisions are opaque ranking schemes, which dictate the ordering of data entities, but their internal logic is inaccessible or proprietary. Drawing inferences about the ranking differences is like a guessing game to the stakeholders, like, the rankees (i.e., the entities who are ranked, like product companies) and the decision-makers (i.e., who use the rankings, like buyers). In this paper, we aim to enable transparency in ranking interpretation by using algorithmic rankers that learn from available data and by enabling human reasoning about the learned ranking differences using explainable AI (XAI) methods. To realize this aim, we leverage the exploration-explanation paradigm of human-data interaction to let human stakeholders explore subsets and groupings of complex multi-attribute ranking data using visual explanations of model fit and attribute influence on rankings. We realize this explanation paradigm for transparent ranking interpretation in TRIVEA, a visual analytic system that is fueled by: (i) visualizations of model fit derived from algorithmic rankers that learn the associations between attributes and rankings from available data and (ii) visual explanations derived from XAI methods that help abstract important patterns, like, the relative influence of attributes in different ranking ranges. Using TRIVEA, end users not trained in data science have the agency to transparently reason about the global and local behavior of the rankings without the need to open black-box ranking models and develop confidence in the resulting attribute-based inferences. We demonstrate the efficacy of TRIVEA using multiple usage scenarios and subjective feedback from researchers with diverse domain expertise.

AB Transmission expansion planning (TEP) is crucial for maintaining the reliable and efficient operation of the power systems, particularly in the face of increasing electricity demand and the integration of renewable energy sources. This paper aims to investigate the application of unconventional high surge impedance loading (HSIL) lines in TEP and presents a comparative analysis of their outcomes against conventional line-based TEP approaches. Starting with a 17-bus 500 kV test system, which can operate well under normal operating condition as well as all single contingency conditions, the objective is to connect a new load located in a new bus, bus #18, to the existing test system via two approaches: using conventional lines and incorporating unconventional HSIL lines. By comparing the number of lines required for the conventional and unconventional approaches, maintaining identical conductor weight per circuit, the effectiveness of unconventional HSIL lines in TEP is evaluated where using only two unconventional HSIL lines is sufficient to connect 1250 MW load demand at bus 18 while three transmission lines are required when using the conventional line. Finally, a thorough economic analysis has been conducted on both TEP scenarios, revealing that implementing unconventional HSIL lines leads to remarkable cost savings and thus can be considered a promising option for TEP studies.

AB Accurate prediction of citywide crowd activity levels (CALs), i.e., the numbers of participants of citywide crowd activities under different venue categories at certain time and locations, is essential for the city management, the personal service applications, and the entrepreneurs in commercial strategic planning. Existing studies have not thoroughly taken into account the complex spatial and temporal interactions among different categories of CALs and their extreme occurrences, leading to lowered adaptivity and accuracy of their models. To address above concerns, we have proposed IE-CALP, a novel spatio-temporal I nteractive attention-based and E xtreme-aware model for C rowd A ctivity L evel P rediction. The tasks of IE-CALP consist of (a) forecasting the spatial distributions of various CALs at different city regions (spatial CALs), and (b) predicting the number of participants per category of the CALs (categorical CALs). To realize above, we have designed a novel spatial CAL-POI interaction-attentive learning component in IE-CALP to model the spatial interactions across different CAL categories, as well as those among the spatial urban regions and CALs. In addition, IE-CALP incorporate the multi-level trends (e.g., daily and weekly levels of temporal granularity) of CALs through a multi-level temporal feature learning component. Furthermore, to enhance the model adaptivity to extreme CALs (e.g., during extreme urban events or weather conditions), we further take into account the extreme value theory and model the impacts of historical CALs upon the occurrences of extreme CALs. Extensive experiments upon a total of 738,715 CAL records and 246,660 POIs in New York City (NYC), Los Angeles (LA), and Tokyo have further validated the accuracy, adaptivity, and effectiveness of IE-CALP's interaction-attentive and extreme-aware CAL predictions.

AB This paper introduces a high-voltage test system tailored specifically for transmission expansion planning (TEP). The network incorporates long transmission lines, and the line series impedance and shunt admittance for each line are computed utilizing the equivalent.. circuit model for long transmission lines to account for the distributed nature of line parameters. The proposed test system offers technically feasible load flow solutions under normal and all single contingency conditions for three distinct loading scenarios: peak, dominant, and light loading conditions. As the real power system is subject to various loading scenarios and should be effectively operable under all conditions, this test system accurately replicates the properties of real power systems. The test system introduced in this paper can be a valuable resource for TEP research.

AB Despite the success of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) in approximating partial differential equations (PDEs), PINNs can sometimes fail to converge to the correct solution in problems involving complicated PDEs. This is reflected in several recent studies on characterizing the "failure modes" of PINNs, although a thorough understanding of the connection between PINN failure modes and sampling strategies is missing. In this paper, we provide a novel perspective of failure modes of PINNs by hypothesizing that training PINNs relies on successful "propagation" of solution from initial and/or boundary condition points to interior points. We show that PINNs with poor sampling strategies can get stuck at trivial solutions if there are propagation failures, characterized by highly imbalanced PDE residual fields. To mitigate propagation failures, we propose a novel Retain-Resample-Release sampling (R3) algorithm that can incrementally accumulate collocation points in regions of high PDE residuals with little to no computational overhead. We provide an extension of R3 sampling to respect the principle of causality while solving time-dependent PDEs. We theoretically analyze the behavior of R3 sampling and empirically demonstrate its efficacy and efficiency in comparison with baselines on a variety of PDE problems.

AB In conventional lines, subconductors are located symmetrically on an identical circle in each phase. The number of subconductors in a bundle, the radius of the bundle circle, and the radius of each subconductor, are chosen so that the maximum electric field strength on the subconductors, E-max, is limited to the permissible field strength on the conductor surface, E-pr, (E-max <= E-pr), which is determined by the corona discharge limitation requirement. In this paper, we show that by shifting phase configurations and subconductors into unusual/unconventional arrangements that are geometrically optimized within the space, high power density designs can be achieved. A novel bundle and phase arrangement of a 500 kV transmission line is presented in this paper, resulting in higher natural power than conventional design.

AB Object counting in images has been studied extensively, in particular using deep network models recently. The existing counting models typically output the point estimates of the object counts in given images. However, none of these can provide reliable uncertainty quantification of the derived count estimates, which is critical for consequent decision making when adopting these counting models in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a novel deep counting model in a Bayesian framework. With the designed Bayesian attention module and Bayesian counting loss function, our deep Bayesian counting model not only improves the accuracy of count estimates with varying object and background appearance; but also enables their uncertainty quantification. We specifically focus on plant counting, which plays important roles in AI-augmented agriculture, for example crop yield estimates and farm management. Our ablation studies and experiments with the real-world agriculture data in the Global Wheat dataset have demonstrated that our deep Bayesian counting model obtains high count estimation accuracy as well as reliable uncertainty quantification. In addition, with the integrated Bayesian attention modules, it may help improve the interpretability of the derived count estimates, especially when the distribution of the interested plants in images is heterogeneous.

AB Understanding public preference is a key ingredient in the sustainable design and implementation of climate change policies. Through a nationally representative survey based in the US, this study examines the likelihood of public support for four policy options: using carbon capture and storage (CCS) subsidies, using private funds for CCS, requiring emissions reduction, and using carbon penalties. Out of 1850 survey respondents, 47% prefer reducing carbon generation, 19% favor a CCS subsidy, 17% private-led CCS, and the rest 17% prefer penalizing emissions. Regression results show that: (1) Individuals who believe CCS can address climate change are likely to favor policies that incorporate CCS technology either via subsidies or private funds, (2) Individuals who believe CCS poses a danger to the community and those who mistrust the safe operation of CCS by the private sector are likely to favor a non-CCS policy option of achieving climate change by limiting emissions, (3) Individuals that mistrust the private sector's safe operation of CCS are also likely to favor penalizing emissions and oppose a private-led CCS, (4) Individuals who believe the government will adequately regulate CCS are likely to support policies that promote CCS via government subsidies and not private means, and (5) Individual traits and demography characters influence climate policy preference. The study provides insights for designing and implementing climate policies that either incorporate or exclude the use of CCS technology in achieving net zero emission goals.

AB Saddle point search schemes are widely used to identify the transition state of different processes, like chemical reactions, surface and bulk diffusion, surface adsorption, and many more. In solid-state materials with relatively large numbers of atoms, the minimum mode following schemes such as dimer are commonly used because they alleviate the calculation of the Hessian on the high-dimensional potential energy surface. Here, we show that the dimer search can be further accelerated by leveraging Gaussian process regression (GPR). The GPR serves as a surrogate model to feed the dimer with the required energy and force input. We test the GPR-accelerated dimer method for predicting the diffusion coefficient of vacancy-mediated self-diffusion in body-centered cubic molybdenum and sulfur diffusion in hexagonal molybdenum disulfide. We use a multitask learning approach that utilizes a shared covariance function between energy and force input, and we show that the multitask learning significantly improves the performance of the GPR surrogate model compared to previously used learning approaches. Additionally, we demonstrate that a translation-hop sampling approach is necessary to avoid overfitting the GPR surrogate model to the minimum-mode-following pathway and thus succeeding in locating the saddle point. We show that our method reduces the number of evaluations compared to a conventional dimer method.

AB To achieve net-zero emission in America by 2050, high voltage transmission capacity must expand approximately 60% by 2030 and triple by 2050 to connect further renewable(wind and solar) facilities to demand. We will fail to achieve a net-zero America through 100% renewables by 2050 unless high-capacity overhead lines are developed in conjunction with other technological advances. To tackle this problem, we developed a revolutionary and flexible design for transmission lines(TL) by changing phase configurations and sub-conductors into unconventional way, geometrically optimal arrangements within the space. To realize these unconventional high surge impedance loading (HSIL) lines, different line design aspects need to be studied. This paper calculates and studies the magnetic field under the aforementioned lines. When calculating the magnetic field from conventional lines at/or near ground level, we can assume an equivalent conductor located in the center of each bundle, however this is not the case for unconventional HSIL lines. As the distance between subconductors is comparable with their height from the ground, we have to calculate the magnetic field generated by each subconductor, so the equivalent conductor mentioned above does not work.

AB There is an increasing demand in various industrial and scientific fields for engineered surfaces with autonomous functionality. These advanced surfaces, designed with specific topographical features, offer superior performance and a broader range of functions compared to surfaces with random roughness. In particular, there is a growing interest in surfaces characterized by periodic patterns. Periodic patterning not only simplifies the design process but also enhances controllability of structural features. For instance, anisotropic periodic patterns such as line arrangements enable directional influence over structural and performance characteristics. Furthermore, periodic patterns enhance the scalability of manufacturing processes. Upon refined fabrication strategy for a single period, it can be efficiently scaled up, resulting in economic benefits and consistency in surface quality. The incorporation of different materials in surface fabrication is another strategy to achieve advanced functionalities. By embedding function-specific materials, objects gain improved mechanical properties, like tensile strength, impact resistance, and physical attributes such as hydrophobicity, electrical insulation, and magnetic responsiveness. Our study utilizes Acoustic Assembly Photopolymerization (AAP), a simple, sustainable, and fast technique that can fabricate structured films with periodic patterns. AAP distinguishes itself with its environmentally friendly characteristics and rapid manufacturing speed for fabricating complex particle-polymer composite films. The AAP-fabricated films are characterized with spatially varying particle-polymer composition along with periodic surface structure. Specifically, this study focuses on the periodic line-patterned particle-polymer composite surface structures fabricated via AAP. As one of the basic particle patterns created by acoustic patterning, the periodic line pattern not only provides directional structure and properties for the fabricated surfaces but also establishes a platform for exploring more complex surface structure designs. The AAP process employs an external acoustic field to position particles into distinct microscale patterns. Upon photopolymerization, films with the periodic line-patterned particle-polymer composite surface structures could be fabricated. Grounded in acoustic assembly physics and curing dynamics, physics-based models were developed in this paper to explore the relationship between AAP process parameters and the periodic line-patterned composite surface architectures fabricated by AAP. By analyzing the acoustic radiation forces and Stokes drag forces acting on particles within an acoustic field, the particle distribution in the particle-polymer suspension is modeled. Subsequently, a curing model that considers particle distribution and exposure time has been established. The models enable the prediction of architecture variables, including the dimensions of ridges and grooves, and the outer contour of the ridge regions. Experimental results have validated the effectiveness of the AAP process and the accuracy of the proposed models for predicting the AAP-fabricated periodic line-patterned surface structures.

AB Bayesian plasticity is presented as an optimal alternative to the delta rule by incorporating uncertainty to guide weight updates. Originally adapted for reservoir computing schemes, Bayesian plasticity showed promise in accelerating the optimization of the mean square error (MSE) function. However, the impact that Bayesian learning rules have in accelerating classification tasks has not been explored. Furthermore, the influence that Bayesian plasticity has on backpropagating weight updates is unclear since reservoir computing only feeds back error to the output layer. Thus, we have simplified and adapted Bayesian plasticity rules to the output layer of non-spiking neural networks and evaluated the impact on training and robustness.

AB This paper presents a 17-bus 500 kV test system for transmission expansion planning (TEP) studies. An actual 500 kV transmission line geometry was used for the overhead lines of this system. Although many test systems have been introduced for different types of power system analysis, those especially for TEP studies at a transmission voltage level, not distribution voltage level, are few. To the best of our knowledge, the introduced test systems for TEP studies, either those combined with electricity market problems or those used to connect a new load or generation to an existing power grid, consider the studies under only normal condition. However, for TEP studies it is needed that a test system meets voltage drop and line loading limits criteria under normal condition as well as all single contingencies, and in this regard, addressing the latter, all single contingencies, is challenging. This paper addresses this technical gap, introducing a 17-bus test system at a transmission voltage level, 500 kV, that meets requirements under normal condition as well as all single contingencies. In addition to presenting all details of this new test system, load flow results under normal condition as well as the worst single contigency are presented. For studies on the TEP, this test system can be an invaluable resource.

DE hate speech detection; language model; BERT; adversarial learning
AB Hate speech datasets contain bias which machine learning models propagate. When these models classify tweets written in African American English (AAE), they predict AAE tweets as hate/abusive at a higher rate than tweets written in Standard American English (SAE). This paper assesses bias in language models fine-tuned for hate speech detection and the effectiveness of adversarial learning in reducing such bias. We introduce AAEBERT, a pre-trained language model for African American English obtained by re-training BERT-base on AAE tweets. AAEBERT is used to extract the representation of each tweet in the various hate speech datasets and to classify tweets into two classes - AAE dialect and non-AAE dialect. A three-layer feedforward neural network that takes the representation from AAEBERT and a dialect label as input is used as the adversarial network for debiasing. We evaluate bias in language models fine-tuned for hate speech detection. Then assess the effectiveness of adversarial debiasing in these models by comparing results before and after adversarial debiasing is applied. Analysis reveals that the fine-tuned models are biased towards AAE, and adversarial debiasing is effective in reducing bias.

AB NMDA-type glutamate receptors are heterotetrameric complexes composed of two GluN1 and two GluN2 subunits. The precise composition of the GluN2 subunits determines the channel's biophysical properties and influences its interaction with postsynaptic scaffolding proteins and signaling molecules involved in synaptic physiology and plasticity. The precise regulation of NMDAR subunit composition at synapses is crucial for proper synaptogenesis, neuronal circuit development, and synaptic plasticity, a cellular model of memory formation. In the forebrain during early development, NMDARs contain solely the GluN2B subunit, which is necessary for proper synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity. In rodents, GluN2A subunit expression begins in the second postnatal week, replacing GluN2B-containing NMDARs at synapses in an activity- or sensory experience-dependent process. This switch in NMDAR subunit composition at synapses alters channel properties and reduces synaptic plasticity. The molecular mechanism regulating the switch remains unclear. We have investigated the role of activity-dependent internalization of GluN2B-containing receptors in shaping synaptic NMDAR subunit composition. Using molecular, pharmacological, and electrophysiological approaches in cultured organotypic hippocampal slices from rats of both sexes, we show that the process of incorporating GluN2A-containing NMDAR receptors requires activity-dependent internalization of GluN2B-containing NMDARs. Interestingly, blockade of GluN2A synaptic incorporation was associated with impaired potentiation of AMPA-mediated synaptic transmission, suggesting a potential coupling between the trafficking of AMPARs into synapses and that of GluN2A-containing NMDARs. These insights contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying synaptic trafficking of glutamate receptors and synaptic plasticity. They may also have implications for therapeutic strategies targeting NMDAR function in neurological disorders.

AB This paper develops a new concept that we call transmission expansion planning (TEP)-based unconventional high surge impedance loading (HSIL) line design. To date, these two areas (TEP and transmission line design) have been conducted separately. For TEP, planners typically use the electrical parameters of a few standard conventional line designs to study planning scenarios, and then, the final candidate line is constructed. In such a sequence, cost-effective scenarios often do not meet the technical criteria of load flow. In this paper, we will study whether this sequence can be overturned; namely, can a transmission expansion planner get optimal line parameter values that lead to the most cost-effective scenario, and then have a transmission line with those parameters be designed? Although this cannot currently be realized through conventional designs, in this paper, we demonstrate that it is a possibility if breakthrough designs for transmission lines are used by shifting phase configurations and subconductors into unconventional HSIL arrangements, leading to the optimal line parameters determined by TEP.

AB The educational applications of extended reality (XR) modalities, including virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR), have increased significantly over the last ten years. Many educators within the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) related degree programs see student benefits that could be derived from bringing these modalities into classrooms, which include but are not limited to: a better understanding of each of the subdisciplines and the coordination necessary between them, visualizing oneself as a professional in AEC, and visualization of difficult concepts to increase engagement, self-efficacy, and learning. These benefits, in turn, help recruitment and retention efforts for these degree programs. However, given the number of technologies available and the fact that they quickly become outdated, there is confusion about the definitions of the different XR modalities and their unique capabilities. This lack of knowledge, combined with limited faculty time and lack of financial resources, can make it overwhelming for educators to choose the right XR modality to accomplish particular educational objectives. There is a lack of guidance in the literature for AEC educators to consider various factors that affect the success of an XR intervention. Grounded in a comprehensive literature review and the educational framework of the Model of Domain Learning, this paper proposes a decision-making framework to help AEC educators select the appropriate technologies, platforms, and devices to use for various educational outcomes (e.g., learning, interest generation, engagement) considering factors such as budget, scalability, space/equipment needs, and the potential benefits and limitations of each XR modality. To this end, a comprehensive review of the literature was performed to decipher various definitions of XR modalities and how they have been previously utilized in AEC Education. The framework was then successfully validated at a summer camp in the School of Building Construction at Georgia Institute of Technology, highlighting the importance of using appropriate XR technologies depending on the educational context.

AB In this paper, we propose a framework to solve the data-driven quadratic stabilization (DDQS) and the data-driven linear quadratic regulator (DDLQR) problems for both continuous and discrete-time systems. Given noisy input/state measurements and a few priors, we aim to find a state feedback controller guaranteed to quadratically stabilize all systems compatible with the a-priori information and the experimental data. In principle, finding such a controller is a non-convex robust optimization problem. Our main result shows that, by exploiting duality, the problem can be recast into a convex, albeit infinite-dimensional, functional Linear Program. To address the computational complexity entailed in solving this problem, we show that a sequence of increasingly tight finite dimensional semi-definite relaxations can be obtained using sum-of-squares and Putinar's Positivstellensatz arguments. Finally, we show that these arguments can also be used to find controllers that minimize a worst-case (over all plants in the consistency set) closed-loop H2 cost. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is illustrated through comparisons against existing data-driven methods that handle  pound infinity bounded noise.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB We experimentally demonstrate a compact on-chip narrowband Fourier Transform spectrometer (FTS) based on spatially heterodyned array of loop-terminated Mach-Zehnder interferometers (LT-MZIs) in a foundry fabricated silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform for chip-integrated sensing applications. We demonstrate that LT-MZIs with the same progressive geometric path length difference between the spatially heterodyned arrayed interferometer arms, as in Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs), double the optical phase delay and thus double the wavelength resolution compared to MZIs. Our proof-of-concept device demonstrates one method to address the bandwidth-resolution-compactness tradeoff inherent in on-chip FTSs. The resolution enhancement is significant for optical sensing applications in biosensing and chemical sensing requiring single digit picometers resolution within a narrow wavelength bandwidth in compact on-chip form factors. We discuss the challenges arising from fabrication imperfections in spatially heterodyned FTS in foundry fabricated chips. We propose a method to compensate for phase errors arising from fabrication imperfections within a narrow wavelength bandwidth in the FTS using the refractive index changes in the amorphous to crystalline phase transformations of phase change materials (PCMs), which would enable zero active power consumption during on-chip narrowband FTS operation.

AB Soft robotics enriches the robotic functionalities by engineering soft materials and electronics toward enhanced compliance, adaptivity, and friendly human machine. This decade has witnessed extraordinary progresses and benefits in scaling down soft robotics to small scale for a wide range of potential and promising applications, including medical and surgical soft robots, wearable and rehabilitation robots, and unconstructed environments exploration. This perspective highlights recent research efforts in miniature soft robotics in a brief and comprehensive way in terms of actuation, powering, designs, fabrication, control, and applications in four sections. Section 2 discusses the key aspects of materials selection and structural designs for small-scale tethered and untethered actuation and powering, including fluidic actuation, stimuli-responsive actuation, and soft living biohybrid materials, as well as structural forms from 1D to 3D. Section 3 discusses the advanced manufacturing techniques at small scales for fabricating miniature soft robots, including lithography, mechanical self-assembly, additive manufacturing, tissue engineering, and other fabrication methods. Section 4 discusses the control systems used in miniature robots, including off-board/onboard controls and artificial intelligence-based controls. Section 5 discusses their potential broad applications in healthcare, small-scale objects manipulating and processing, and environmental monitoring. Finally, outlooks on the challenges and opportunities are discussed.

AB Many crystals, such as lanthanum zirconate (La 2 Zr 2 O 7 ), exhibit a flat temperature dependence of thermal conductivity at elevated temperatures. This phenomenon has recently been attributed to the interband phonon tunneling (or diffuson) contribution using different formalisms. However, the contributions of finitetemperature corrections (e.g., higher-order phonon scattering, phonon renormalization, and phonon-scattering cross -section softening effects) and radiation at high temperatures remain unclear. In this work, we predict and compare the thermal conductivity of La 2 Zr 2 O 7 using three distinct first-principles methods. The first method is Green-Kubo molecular dynamics (MD) based on temperature-dependent machine-learning interatomic potentials trained from ab initio MD simulations, which successfully predict the flat trend at ultrahigh temperatures. The second method is the Peierls Boltzmann transport equation (BTE), within the phonon particle framework, using phonon lifetime that includes all the finite-temperature corrections. Fourphonon scattering is found large but is canceled by the phonon-scattering cross -section softening effect. As a result, BTE with temperature corrections does not reproduce the flat thermal conductivity. The third method is Wigner formalism, which includes both phonon particle and wave contributions, which successfully reproduce the flat thermal conductivity. Diffuson and phonon contribute about 67 and 27% of thermal conductivity at 1800 K, respectively. The radiation contribution to thermal conductivity is calculated by the Rosseland model and found to be around 6%. The scaling laws of the phonon, diffuson, radiation, and total thermal conductivity are found to be <^> T - 0 . 97 , <^> T 0 . 43 , <^> T 2 . 01 , and <^> T - 0 . 40 , respectively. This work clarifies the thermal transport mechanisms in La 2 Zr 2 O 7 at ultrahigh temperatures from different aspects.

AB Spatial-temporal graph data widely appear in real-world applications like traffic flow forecasting and skeleton-based action recognition. To effectively handle such data, spatial-temporal graph learning neural networks (STGNNs) have emerged as a promising solution and outperform traditional deep learning in these tasks. However, existing studies mainly focus on the performance aspect but lack a systematic study on their robustness when spatial-temporal graph structure varies. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by systematically investigating the structure vulnerabilities of a variety of popular STGNNs in practical tasks. To this end, a spatial-temporal graph attack framework, namely Ants, which consists of gradient-sign guided sensitive time-slice selection followed by quantization-based adversarial edge searching, is proposed to craft minimized adversarial perturbations on discrete spatial-temporal graph data in both spatial and temporal dimensions. Extensive experiments on traffic flow forecasting and human action recognition tasks with six STGNNs and four datasets well demonstrate the effectiveness and stealthiness of our Ants. While prior works do not consider attacks on spatial-temporal graphs, we compare our attack with state-of-the-art attacks on graphical models extended to the STGNN setup, and the performance of Ants demonstrates that, for STGNNs, the structure vulnerability in the context of spatial and temporal dynamics needs to be considered carefully.

AB We have pursued the use of polymer-networked engineered nanoparticles as a candidate material capable of retaining information or perhaps even processing information in some prescribed way. Such operations would be of use for the neuromorphic engineering of materials that can compute intrinsically-that is, that they are in no way subject to a von Neumann architecture-and they have been identified as autonomous computing materials. Using trajectories integrated to much longer time steps than previously observed, we can now confirm that the response of the polymer-networked engineered nanoparticle arrays are highly sensitive to external perturbations. That is, the specific internal connections around given nanoparticles can be assigned to states useful for information processing, and the variations in their physical properties can result in specific responses allowing the state to be read. Moreover, their resulting equilibrium properties also depend on such external driving, and hence are subject to control which is a minimal requirement for these materials to be candidates for autonomous computing. We also demonstrate that using long polymer chains can help regulate the networks structures by increasing the 1st nearest links and reducing other links.

AB Emergency and non-emergency response systems are essential services provided by local governments and critical to protecting lives, the environment, and property. The effective handling of (non-)emergency calls is critical for public safety and well-being. By reducing the burden through non-emergency callers, residents in critical need of assistance through 911 will receive fast and effective response. Collaborating with the Department of Emergency Communications (DEC) in Nashville, we analyzed 11,796 non-emergency call recordings and developed Auto3111, the first automated system to handle 311 non-emergency calls, which (1) effectively and dynamically predicts ongoing non-emergency incident types to generate tailored case reports during the call; (2) itemizes essential information from dialogue contexts to complete the generated reports; and (3) strategically structures system-caller dialogues with optimized confidence. We used real-world data to evaluate the system's effectiveness and deployability. The experimental results indicate that the system effectively predicts incident type with an average F-1 score of 92.54%. Moreover, the system successfully itemizes critical information from relevant contexts to complete reports, evincing a 0.93 average consistency score compared to the ground truth. Additionally, emulations demonstrate that the system effectively decreases conversation turns as the utterance size gets more extensive and categorizes the ongoing call with 94.49% mean accuracy.

AB The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technology in industrial surveillance and the proliferation of surveillance cameras in smart cities has empowered the development of real-time activity recognition and violence detection systems, respectively. These systems are crucial in enhancing safety measures, improving operational efficiency, reducing accident risks, and providing automatic monitoring in dynamic environments. In this paper, we propose a three-stage deep learning-based end-to-end framework for violence detection. The lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) model initially identifies individuals in the video stream to minimize the processing of irrelevant frames. Subsequently, a sequence of 50 frames with identified persons is directed to a 3D-CNN model, where the spatiotemporal features of these sequences are extracted and passed to the classifier. Unlike traditional methods that process all frames indiscriminately, this targeted filtering mechanism allows computational resources to be allocated more effectively. Next, SoftMax classifier processes the extracted features to categorize frame sequences as violent or non-violent. The classifier's predictions trigger real-time alerts, enabling rapid intervention. The modularity of this stage supports adaptability to new datasets, as it can leverage transfer learning to generalize across diverse surveillance contexts. Unlike traditional systems constrained by hand-crafted features, this design dynamically learns from data, reducing reliance on prior domain knowledge and improving generalizability. We conducted experiments on violence detection across four datasets, comparing the performance of our model with convolutional CNN models. A computation time analysis revealed that our lightweight model requires significantly less computation time, demonstrating its efficiency. We also conducted cross-data experiments to assess the model's capacity to perform consistently across various datasets. Experiments show that our proposed model outperforms the methods mentioned in the existing literature. These experiments demonstrate that the model's adaptability and robustness need to be improved.

AB Nonlinearity presents a significant challenge in developing quantum algorithms involving differential equations, prompting the exploration of various linearization techniques, including the well-known Carleman Linearization. Instead, this paper introduces the Koopman Spectral Linearization method tailored for nonlinear autonomous ordinary differential equations. This innovative linearization approach harnesses the interpolation methods and the Koopman Operator Theory to yield a lifted linear system. It promises to serve as an alternative approach that can be employed in scenarios where Carleman Linearization is traditionally applied. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this linearization approach for several commonly used nonlinear ordinary differential equations.

AB In certain emerging applications such as health monitoring wearable and traffic monitoring systems, Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices generate or collect a huge amount of multi-label datasets. Within these datasets, each instance is linked to a set of labels. The presence of noisy, redundant, or irrelevant features in these datasets, along with the curse of dimensionality, poses challenges for multi-label classifiers. Feature selection (FS) proves to be an effective strategy in enhancing classifier performance and addressing these challenges. Yet, there is currently no existing distributed multi-label FS method documented in the literature that is suitable for distributed multi-label datasets within IoT environments. This paper introduces FMLFS, the first federated multi label feature selection method. Here, mutual information between features and labels serves as the relevancy metric, while the correlation distance between features, derived from mutual information and joint entropy, is utilized as the redundancy measure. Following aggregation of these metrics on the edge server and employing Pareto-based bi-objective and crowding distance strategies, the sorted features are subsequently sent back to the IoT devices. The proposed method is evaluated through two scenarios: 1) transmitting reduced-size datasets to the edge server for centralized classifier usage, and 2) employing federated learning with reduced size datasets. Evaluation across three metrics - performance, time complexity, and communication cost - demonstrates that FMLFS outperforms five other comparable methods in the literature and provides a good trade-off on three real-world datasets.

ID DIVERGENCE
AB Generative adversarial networks (GANs), modeled as a zero-sum game between a generator (G) and a discriminator (D), allow generating synthetic data with formal guarantees. Noting that D is a classifier, we begin by reformulating the GAN value function using class probability estimation (CPE) losses. We prove a two-way correspondence between CPE loss GANs and f-GANs which minimize f-divergences. We also show that all symmetric f-divergences are equivalent in convergence. In the finite sample and model capacity setting, we define and obtain bounds on estimation and generalization errors. We specialize these results to alpha-GANs, defined using alpha-loss, a tunable CPE loss family parametrized by a is an element of(0, infinity]. We next introduce a class of dual-objective GANs to address training instabilities of GANs by modeling each player's objective using alpha-loss to obtain (alpha(D), alpha(G))-GANs. We show that the resulting non-zero sum game simplifies to minimizing an f-divergence under appropriate conditions on (alpha(D), alpha(G)). Generalizing this dual-objective formulation using CPE losses, we define and obtain upper bounds on an appropriately defined estimation error. Finally, we highlight the value of tuning (alpha(D), alpha(G)) in alleviating training instabilities for the synthetic 2D Gaussian mixture ring as well as the large publicly available Celeb-A and LSUN Classroom image datasets.

DE deep learning; multimodal learning; drug discovery
AB Drug discovery is a challenging process, requiring the optimization of compounds to become safe and effective. Predicting molecular properties is an indispensable step in the drug discovery pipeline. Traditionally, this process is costly, involving multiple rounds of experiments, rendering it impractical for every candidate compound. Deep learning techniques have emerged as a promising approach to drug discovery to reduce the cost during the process. However, prevalent research in deep learning models focused on predicting molecular properties has primarily fixated on single-modal models, neglecting the potential benefits of combining different data modalities. To overcome this limitation, we introduce MRL-Mol: a deep Multimodal Representation Learning framework for accurate Molecular properties prediction. MRL-Mol harnesses three data modalities: sequence, graph, and image, augmenting the depth of comprehension. Leveraging a large-scale unlabeled dataset ( 1M unique molecules), we pretrain MRL-Mol to extract inter- and intra-modal information. Our study demonstrates the superior performance of MRL-Mol in predicting molecular properties across six benchmark datasets. Notably, MRL-Mol outperforms other state-of-the-art molecular properties prediction models. These findings suggest that by combining information from multiple data modalities, MRL-Mol can comprehend molecules better than single-modal deep learning models and identify molecular properties with better accuracy.

AB The electric field intensity on subconductors is the most important parameter to consider when electrically designing (extra) high voltage, (E)HV, transmission lines. In this regard, it is not possible to use existing formulae for calculating electric field intensity on subconductors, which are for subconductors placed symmetrically on bundle circles, for recently introduced unconventional high power density lines where subconductors can be located in unsymmetrical or at any location in the space. Further, in existing formulas, nearby (other phases) and image conductors are ignored, and a uniform field is assumed despite the fact that electric fields are distorted in the presence of other subconductors in a bundle. None of the mentioned assumptions are valid for unconventional high power density lines, so it is necessary to develop an innovative method for calculating electric field on subconductors on these new lines. In our method, r/2 line charges for each subconductor are employed to set the electric potentials of n(m) points at the periphery of that subconductor equal to the applied voltage. The line charges are uniformly distributed around a hypothetical cylinder with a radius of r/2, where r is the radius of that subconductor. The challenge is choosing a proper n(m), leading to an accurate result.

AB Motivated by the challenges in detecting extremely rare failures for sophisticated specifications in circuit design, we consider the problem of detecting regions of interest (ROIs) that consist of specifications with the value of a complex target function for the system performance being below or above a certain pre-specified threshold. Though Bayesian optimization (BO) has been applied to this problem, it is not effective in identifying multiple ROIs as it was originally designed for global optimization and tends to focus on searching the area where the global optimum is most likely to be. In this work, we propose a sampling strategy for fast ROI detection within a limited number of target function evaluations. The sampling distribution is designed so that the probability of a specification being sampled is proportional to the corresponding value of the acquisition function. Such an acquisition-guided sampling algorithm promotes a wider search of the sample space and a simpler incorporation of different criteria to determine the specifications to be evaluated next. To further improve the performance, we propose a new design of the acquisition function and two modifications of existing acquisition functions. Numerical studies on synthetic functions and a real-world circuit design application demonstrate that the proposed method can enjoy a stronger exploration ability provided by sampling and achieve faster ROI detection with higher coverage. Note to Practitioners-This study considers the extremely rare failure detection in automated circuit design, fabrication, packaging, and verification. Obtaining enough observations of interest within a given budget of evaluations is challenging due to the scarcity of extremely rare failures. Bayesian optimization (BO) has been adopted to tackle this problem, but it may not achieve satisfactory coverage of multiple failure regions, since its goal is to find the global optimum of the target function. In this paper, we propose a sampling-based rare event detection strategy tailored to efficiently detect regions of interest (ROIs) with high coverage, along with newly designed acquisition functions incorporating the pre-specified threshold and ideas of experimental design. This sampling strategy has greater robustness to the choice of acquisition function. Also, since multiple queries can be easily obtained through sampling, various criteria can be easily incorporated for determining the next batch of evaluation specifications without much increase in computational complexity.

AB We experimentally demonstrate slow light photonic crystal waveguide (PCW) and subwavelength waveguide (SWWG) loop terminated Mach-Zehnder interferometer (LT-MZI) sensors in a foundry-fabricated silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform. We compare the experimental results on sensitivity and limit of detection (LOD) on the interferometer sensors with microcavity-type sensors. We show experimentally that 2-D PCW interferometers have higher phase sensitivities than SWWGs of the same length. Based on experimental results, 20-mu m-long 2-D PCW LT-MZI sensors and 200-mu m-long SWWG LT-MZI sensors achieve an LOD of 3.4 x 10(-4 )and 2.3 x 10(-4) RIU, respectively, with nearly the same insertion losses in foundry-fabricated devices. We show that by considering the various sources of loss in our benchtop fiber-to-fiber photonic integrated circuit measurement system, it will be possible to reach 10(-7) LOD in both slow light PCW and SWWG-based LT-MZI sensors with on-chip integrated light sources and detectors. We show via simulations and experiment that the LOD of a 20-mu m-long slow light PCW LT-MZI is equivalent to that of a 100-mu m-long SWWG LT-MZI, thus enabling more compact LT_MZI sensors when using slow light PCWs versus SWWGs.

TI Impacts of Collaborative Robots on Construction Work Performance and
   Worker Perception: Experimental Analysis of Human-Robot Collaborative
   Wood Assembly
SO JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT
LA English

ID TECHNOLOGY ACCEPTANCE MODEL; COST
AB Collaborative robots are increasingly recognized as potential assistants to relieve workers from repetitive and physically demanding tasks on construction jobsites. Despite the great potential, most efforts have focused on developing various artificial intelligence (AI) and robotic technologies to achieve specific human-robot collaboration (HRC) functions. However, there is a significant lack of research regarding the impacts of such collaboration on construction work performance and workers' perception and acceptance of collaborative robots, which could be a critical influence factor on the feasibility and effectiveness of HRC on construction jobsites. To this end, this study aims to evaluate the multidimensional impacts of collaborative robots on work efficiency, quality, and workload as well as workers' perception and acceptance. HRC experiments on sample construction tasks (i.e., wood assembly) were conducted in conjunction with quantitative measurements and subject surveys. Through comparison between HRC experiments and human-human collaboration (HHC) experiments based on this case study, it was found that HRC could improve up to 29.3% and 88.6% in work efficiency and assembly accuracy, respectively, and reduce workers' workload by up to 20.3%. Furthermore, workers' perception of HRC is found to be positive overall with higher acceptance after HRC experience, characterized by questionnaires designed based on the technology acceptance model. Through physical experiments, this research is expected to produce more reliable results compared with conventional approaches where participants are simply provided with imaginary scenarios. The findings will also guide the development of robotic technologies to enhance the practical application of HRC in construction.

AB The potential of van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure to incorporate the outstanding features of stacked materials to meet a variety of application requirements has drawn considerable attention. Due to the unique quantum tunneling mechanisms, a type-III broken-gap obtained from vdW heterostructure is a promising design strategy for tunneling field-effect transistors. Herein, a unique Ga2O3/SiC vdW bilayer heterostructure with inherent type-III broken gap band alignment has been revealed through first-principles calculation. The underlying physical mechanism to form the broken gap band alignment is thoroughly studied. Due to the overlapping band structures, a tunneling window of 0.609 eV has been created, which enables the charges to tunnel from the VBM of the SiC layer to the CBM of the Ga2O3 layer and fulfills the required condition for band-to-band tunneling. External electric field and strain can be applied to tailor the electronic behavior of the bilayer heterostructure. Positive external electric field and compressive vertical strain enlarge the tunneling window and enhance the band-to-band tunneling (BTBT) scheme while negative electric field and tensile vertical strain shorten the BTBT window. Under external electric field as well as vertical and biaxial strain, the Ga2O3/SiC vdW hetero-bilayer maintains the type-III band alignment, revealing its capability to tolerate the external electric field and strain with resilience. All these results provide a compelling platform of the Ga2O3/SiC vdW bilayer to design high performance tunneling field effect transistor.

DE parallelization; spark; classification
AB In data science and machine learning, efficient and scalable algorithms are paramount for handling large datasets and complex tasks. Classification algorithms, in particular, play a crucial role in a wide range of applications, from image recognition and natural language processing to fraud detection and medical diagnosis. Traditional classification methods, while effective, often struggle with scalability and efficiency when applied to massive datasets. This challenge has driven the development of innovative approaches that leverage modern computational frameworks and parallel processing capabilities. This paper presents the Bison Algorithm, applied to classification problems. The algorithm, inspired by the social behavior of bison, aims to enhance the accuracy of classification tasks. The Bison Algorithm is implemented using PySpark, leveraging the distributed computing power to handle large datasets efficiently. This study compares the performance of the Bison Algorithm on several dataset sizes using speedup and scaleup as the performance measure.

DE Social infrastructure; critical review; networking spaces; social
   capital
AB Despite the growing recognition of social infrastructure's pivotal role in fostering trust and cooperation, a precise definition remains elusive across various academic disciplines. This study addresses this lacuna by conducting a systematic review of approximately 150 articles published between 1960 and the present. The analysis, encompassing peer-reviewed journals, trade publications, corporate reports, and newspaper articles from diverse geographical contexts, reveals that references to social infrastructure primarily coalesce around five key domains: education, healthcare, housing, transportation, and, increasingly, networking spaces (both physical and virtual). A discernible shift in focus towards networking spaces underscores the escalating significance of infrastructure that facilitates trust-building and connection-enhancing processes. Employing these networking space approaches, we define social infrastructure as the virtual and real-world spaces that involve high stewardship and coproduction, cultivating trust, enhancing cooperation, and deepening social cohesion and social capital. This standardized definition of social infrastructure will bolster research endeavors and advance our understanding of how these facilities contribute to societal cohesion.

AB Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) signal detection is central to nearly every state-of-the-art communication system, and enhancements in error performance and computational complexity of MIMO detection would significantly enhance data rate and latency experienced by the users. Theoretically, the optimal MIMO detector is the maximum-likelihood (ML) MIMO detector; however, due to its extremely high complexity, it is not feasible for large real-world communication systems. Over the past few years, algorithms based on physics-inspired Ising solvers, like Coherent Ising machines and Quantum Annealers, have shown significant performance improvements for the MIMO detection problem. However, the current state-of-the-art is limited to low-order modulations or systems with few users. In this paper, we propose an adaptive multi-stage Ising machine-based MIMO detector that extends the performance gains of physics-inspired computation to Large and Massive MIMO systems with a large number of users and very high modulation schemes (up to 256-QAM). We enhance our previously proposed delta Ising formulation and develop a heuristic that adaptively optimizes the performance and complexity of our proposed method. We perform extensive micro-benchmarking to optimize several free parameters of the system and evaluate our methods' BER and spectral efficiency for Large and Massive MIMO systems (up to 32 users and 256-QAM modulation).

AB This study introduces an advanced federated learning framework tailored for smart home intrusion detection, incorporating knowledge distillation and transfer learning to tackle escalating threats to IoT devices. In light of the rapid expansion of IoT devices and their vulnerability to botnet incursions, our approach specifically addresses the challenges related to the privacy concerns of home device data, heterogeneity of devices, sparse intrusion data, and the dynamic nature of smart home settings. We adaptively select model architectures tailored to the computational capabilities of each device, ranging from simple Neural Networks (NNs) to more complex Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and hybrid CNN-LSTM models, ensuring efficient local training without overburdening the devices. However, it can achieve good performance through collaborative learning, even for devices with lower capacity and sparse data. Our evaluation, conducted using the N-BaIoT dataset, demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in detecting anomalies across a diverse set of IoT devices infected with real-world botnets such as Mirai and BASHLITE. The results highlight the potential of our framework to provide a robust, privacy-preserving, and adaptable solution for securing smart homes against emerging threats.

AB Using robots to automate construction processes can enhance productivity and safety and reduce cost. However, the construction robots haven't been widely accepted primarily due to two challenges: lack of data and computational resources to train robots for performing specific construction tasks, and lack of the capability for robots to deal with new tasks. This paper introduces a framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) to enable robots to perform assembly tasks based on in situ worker instructions without extensive prior robot training. By using predefined prompts tailored to specific tasks, the LLM can interpret worker instructions and generate corresponding action sequences and robot functions without additional training. Hence, this LLM-based approach can effectively reduce training costs and facilitate robot adaptability for new tasks and environments through simple prompt modification. To validate this framework, several interlocking block assembly tasks performed by LLM-based robots were evaluated. It is found simple instructions were accurately executed by the robots, but future research is needed to improve the model to handle complex instructions from humans. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of LLM-based robots in performing assembly tasks in construction with human collaboration.

AB Corona effects are one of the most important factors to take into consideration when designing an overhead transmission line. Corona discharges cause power loss which should be considered during transmission line design. Unconventional high surge impedance loading (HSIL) lines have subconductors placed anywhere in space and have no bundle symmetry. They have the potential to produce greater natural power than conventional lines and conventional HSIL lines. This paper calculates corona loss in both fair and foul weather conditions for an envisaged unconventional HSIL line. It is seen that the unconventional lines under discussion undergo much greater corona loss than the conventional lines and conventional HSIL lines.

AB Online manipulation of multiple micro- and nanoscale agents is of major interest for various research applications. Among the biggest limitations of wireless external actuation are its global and coupled influences in the workspace, which limit the robust manipulation of multiple agents independently and simultaneously. In this paper, we propose novel motion planning algorithms, Bi-iSST and Ref-iSST, to quickly generate time-optimal trajectories for multiple agents sharing global external fields. Both algorithms are extended by the stable sparse rapidly-exploring random tree kinodynamic motion planning algorithm. The Bi-iSST uses a bidirectional approach to speed up the searching process. A novel connection process is proposed to connect the two trees efficiently by applying an optimization procedure. The Ref-iSST uses the workspace information to quickly generate global-routing trajectories as references, then guides the search process more effectively by getting more accurate heuristics according to the reference global-routing trajectories. A transition matrix similar to that in Markov Decision Processes is used to form the reference trajectory. Compared with the state-of-the-art iSST algorithm, the proposed algorithms quickly update feasible solutions and converge to a near-optimal, minimum-time solution to increase the efficiency of the simultaneous manipulation of multiple micro agents using global external fields. Extensive analysis and physical experiments are presented to confirm the effectiveness and the performance of the motion planning algorithms.

AB In the work presented here, we explore the upcycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) that was derived from water bottles. The material was granulated and extruded into a filament compatible with fused filament fabrication (FFF) additive manufacturing platforms. Three iterations of PET combined with a thermoplastic elastomer, styrene ethylene butylene styrene with a maleic anhydride graft (SEBS-g-MA), were made with 5, 10, and 20% by mass elastomer content. The elastomer and specific mass percentages were chosen based on prior successes involving acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), in which the maleic anhydride graft enabled compatibility between different materials. The rheological properties of PET and the PET/SEBS blends were characterized by the melt flow index and dynamic mechanical analysis. The addition of SEBS-g-MA did not have a significant impact on mechanical properties, as determined by tensile and impact testing, where all test specimens were manufactured by FFF. Delamination of the tensile specimens convoluted the ability to discern differences in the mechanical properties, particularly % elongation. Annealing of the specimens enabled the observation of the effect of elastomer content on the mechanical properties, particularly in the case of impact testing, where the impact strength increased with the increase in SEBS content. However, annealing led to shrinkage of the specimens, detracting from the realized benefits of the thermal process. Scanning electron microscopy of spent tensile specimens revealed that, in the non-annealed condition, SEBS formed nodules that would detach from the PET matrix during the tensile test, indicating that a robust bond was not present. The addition of SEBS-g-MA did allow for shape memory property characterization, where deformation of tensile specimens occurred at room temperature. Specimens from the 20% by mass elastomer content sample group exhibited a shape fixation ratio on the order of 99% and a shape recovery ratio on the order of 80%. This work demonstrates a potential waste reduction strategy to tackle the problem of polymer waste by upcycling discarded plastic into a feedstock material for additive manufacturing with shape memory properties.

AB Recent studies regarding the COVID-19 pandemic have revealed the widespread propagation of hateful content during this period. While significant research has focused on COVID-19-related online hate in text (e.g., text-based tweets), the role of memes in propagating online hate during the pandemic has been largely overlooked. Memes are a popular mechanism used by Internet users to convey their thoughts and opinions on a variety of topics. However, memes have emerged as an important mechanism through which ideologically potent and hateful content spreads on social media platforms. In this work, we focus on investigating the role of memes in the propagation of online hate during the COVID-19 pandemic. We first collect a novel dataset of 4,001 COVID-19-related hateful memes and their replies over a 3-year period from Twitter. Then, we carry out the first large-scale investigation into the impact of these memes on Twitter users, by studying the psychological reactions of Twitter users to these memes using various text analysis methods. We find that COVID-19-related hateful memes have a significantly greater negative impact on Twitter users in comparison to text-based hateful tweets, and increasing negativity towards such memes over the 3-year period. Our new dataset of COVID-19-related hateful memes and findings from our work pave the way for studying the dissemination and moderation of COVID-19-related online hate through the medium of memes.

AB In cloud computing systems, elastic events and stragglers increase the uncertainty of the system, leading to computation delays. Coded elastic computing (CEC) introduced by Yang et al. in 2018 is a framework which mitigates the impact of elastic events using Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) coded storage. It proposed a CEC scheme for both matrixvector multiplication and general matrix-matrix multiplication applications. However, in these applications, the proposed CEC scheme cannot tolerate stragglers due to the limitations imposed by MDS codes. In this paper we propose a new elastic computing scheme using uncoded storage and Lagrange coded computing approaches. The proposed scheme can effectively mitigate the effects of both elasticity and stragglers. Moreover, it produces a lower complexity and smaller recovery threshold compared to existing coded storage based schemes.

AB The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 caused the COVID-19 pandemic and accelerated vaccine development to prevent the spread of the virus and control the disease. Given the sustained high infectivity and evolution of SARS-CoV-2, there is an ongoing interest in developing COVID-19 serology tests to monitor population-level immunity. To address this critical need, we designed a paper-based multiplexed vertical flow assay (xVFA) using five structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2, detecting IgG and IgM antibodies to monitor changes in COVID-19 immunity levels. Our platform not only tracked longitudinal immunity levels but also categorized COVID-19 immunity into three groups: protected, unprotected, and infected, based on the levels of IgG and IgM antibodies. We operated two xVFAs in parallel to detect IgG and IgM antibodies using a total of 40 mu L of human serum sample in <20 min per test. After the assay, images of the paper-based sensor panel were captured using a mobile phone-based custom-designed optical reader and then processed by a neural network-based serodiagnostic algorithm. The serodiagnostic algorithm was trained with 120 measurements/tests and 30 serum samples from 7 randomly selected individuals and was blindly tested with 31 serum samples from 8 different individuals, collected before vaccination as well as after vaccination or infection, achieving an accuracy of 89.5%. The competitive performance of the xVFA, along with its portability, cost-effectiveness, and rapid operation, makes it a promising computational point-of-care (POC) serology test for monitoring COVID-19 immunity, aiding in timely decisions on the administration of booster vaccines and general public health policies to protect vulnerable populations.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB This study presents a combined revealed preference (RP) and stated preference (SP) survey to understand travelers' mode choices under the influence of real-time information for different activity types and trip lengths. The D-efficient method is adopted to generate SP scenarios. The empirical data for this study came from a "Survey to understand the impact of ICT on transportation choices" (SUIT; ICT = information and communication technology), conducted in July 2023 in the Washington, DC metro area and the Charlotte metro area, North Carolina (NC), USA A combined RP-SP multinomial logit and mixed logit model (MxL) capturing the error components have been estimated based on the collected data. The model results reveal that daily parking costs significantly impact individuals' mode choices and tend to discourage driving. Furthermore, real-time information such as the availability of parking spaces at workplaces and metro stations encourages people to prefer drive and park & ride modes. Conversely, information on flash flooding alerts, road closures, and road accidents discourages people from driving, riding as auto-passengers, or taking a transportation network company (TNC) (Uber/Lyft) for trip purposes. Lastly, information on reduced waiting time and disruption plays a significant role in selecting transit and park & ride modes. The results obtained from this study can be beneficial to policymakers when assessing or designing alternative sustainable modes in the presence of real-time information. As its policy finding, the study recommends that transit disruption should be handled carefully to retain loyal customers and achieve various sustainability goals. In the event of transit disruption, alternative sustainable transportation modes should be offered to transit riders.

AB Bacterial plant pathogens adjust their gene expression programs in response to environmental signals and host-derived compounds. This ensures that virulence genes or genes encoding proteins, which promote bacterial fitness in a host environment, are expressed only when needed. Such regulation is in the purview of transcription factors, many of which belong to the ubiquitous multiple antibiotic resistance regulator (MarR) protein family. PecS proteins constitute a subset of this large protein family. PecS has likely been distributed by horizontal gene transfer, along with the divergently encoded efflux pump PecM, suggesting its integration into existing gene regulatory networks. Here, we discuss the roles of PecS in the regulation of genes associated with virulence and fitness of bacterial plant pathogens. A comparison of phenotypes and differential gene expression associated with the disruption of pecS shows that functional consequences of PecS integration into existing transcriptional networks are highly variable, resulting in distinct PecS regulons. Although PecS universally binds to the pecS-pecM intergenic region to repress the expression of both genes, binding modes differ. A particularly relaxed sequence preference appears to apply for Dickeya dadantii PecS, perhaps to optimize its integration as a global regulator and regulate genes ancestral to the acquisition of pecS-pecM. Even inducing ligands for PecS are not universally conserved. It appears that PecS function has been optimized to match the unique regulatory needs of individual bacterial species and that its roles must be appreciated in the context of the regulatory networks into which it was recruited.

AB Metabolomics has been widely applied in human diseases and environmental science to study the systematic changes of metabolites over diverse types of stimuli. NMR-based metabolomics has been widely used, but the peak overlap problems in the one-dimensional (1D) NMR spectrum could limit the accuracy of quantitative analysis for metabolomics applications. Two-dimensional (2D) NMR has been applied to solve the 1D NMR overlap problem, but the data processing is still challenging. In this study, we built an automatic approach to process the 2D NMR data for quantitative applications using machine learning approaches. Partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), artificial neural network classification (ANN-DA), gradient boosted trees classification (XGBoost-DA), and artificial deep learning neural network classification (ANNDL-DA) were applied in combination with an automatic peak selection approach. Standard mixtures, sea anemone extracts, and mouse fecal samples were tested to demonstrate the approach. Our results showed that ANN-DA and ANNDL-DA have high accuracy in selecting 2D NMR peaks (around 90 %), which have a high potential application in 2D NMRbased metabolomics quantitively study, while PLS-DA and XGBoost-DA showed limitations in either data variation or overfitting. Our study built an automatic approach to applying 2D NMR data to routine quantitative analysis in metabolomics.

AB Mainstream platforms' content moderation systems typically employ generalized "one-size-fits-all" approaches, intended to serve both general and marginalized users. Thus, transgender people must often create their own technologies and moderation systems to meet their specific needs. In our interview study of transgender technology creators (n=115), we found that creators face issues of transphobic abuse and disproportionate content moderation. Trans tech creators address these issues by carefully moderating and vetting their userbases, centering trans contexts in content moderation systems, and employing collective governance and community models. Based on these findings, we argue that trans tech creators' approaches to moderation offer important insights into how to better design for trans users, and ultimately, marginalized users in the larger platform ecology. We introduce the concept of trans-centered moderation - content moderation that reviews and successfully vets transphobic users, appoints trans moderators to effectively moderate trans contexts, considers the limitations and constraints of technology for addressing social challenges, and employs collective governance and community models. Trans-centered moderation can help to improve platform design for trans users while reducing the harm faced by trans people and marginalized users more broadly.

AB Cascading failures in power grids, where failures propagate from one component to another, are a major cause of large-scale blackouts. With renewed interest in enhancing power grid resilience, it is even more critical to predict cascading failures so that effective mitigative actions can be identified. The existing cascading failure prediction methods lack high accuracy and fast computation time and often face challenges due to unbalanced or unrepresentative datasets. In this work, a comparative study of various data-driven methods for failure prediction with a shorter computation time is provided. The problem is formulated as a binary classification, where the input features, such as the loading levels of the transmission lines, are mapped to the output, which is the failure status of the transmission lines. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, the IEEE 30-bus system is used as a test case, and the results confirm the viability of the compared methods for failure prediction. This study could guide future research in developing fast and accurate data-driven cascading failure models.

ID BUILT-ENVIRONMENT; PATTERNS; PROFILES; DESIGN; GENDER; AGE
AB Accurate modeling of human time-activity trajectory is essential to support community resilience and emergency response strategies such as daily energy planning and urban seismic vulnerability assessment. However, existing modeling of time-activity trajectory is only driven by socio-demographic information with identical activity trajectories shared among the same group of people and neglects the influence of the environment. To further improve human time-activity trajectory modeling, this paper constructs community time-activity trajectory and analyzes how social-demographic and built environment influence people's activity trajectory based on Markov Chains and Dirichlet Regression. We use the New York area as a case study and gather data from American Time Use Survey, Policy Map, and the New York City Energy & Water Performance Map to evaluate the proposed method. To validate the regression model, Box's M Test and t-test are performed with 80% data training the model and the left 20% as the test sample. The modeling results align well with the actual human behavior trajectories, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method. It also shows that both social-demographic and built environment factors will significantly impact a community's time-activity trajectory. Specifically: 1) Diversity and median age both have a significant influence on the proportion of time people assign to education activity. 2) Transportation condition affects people's activity trajectory in the way that longer commute time decreases the proportion of biological activity (eg. sleeping and eating) and increases people's working time. 3) Residential density affects almost all activities with a significant p-value for all biological needs, household management, working, education, and personal preference.

AB Continued and amplified harm to marginalized communities by computing solutions is pushing computing education to orient towards justice. Resisting harm requires elevating teacher voices within curricular design. We partnered with twelve high school teachers to co-design and revise an existing introductory computing program. We qualitatively analyzed post-co-design teacher interviews to answer the following: (1) How did teachers perceive their involvement in curricular design? (2) What design aspects of the curricular revision did teachers identify as important to participate as co-designers? (3) What design features supported or challenged teacher participation? Being involved in co-design made teachers feel valued and respected rather than deprofessionalized. Holding a safe space with politicized trust was key to their participation, and opportunities to reflect, share, and listen from diverse perspectives were essential. Policies around curricular design work should emphasize empowering trusting teacher communities to advance justice-oriented goals within computing education.

AB This study investigates the effects on different racial/ethnic groups of middle school students when learning with a digital learning game, Decimal Point, and a comparable computer tutor. Using data from three classroom studies with 835 students, we compared learning outcomes and engagement among students from racial/ethnic groups that are well-represented in STEM (white and Asian) to those that are underrepresented in STEM (Black, Hispanic/Latine, Indigenous, and multiracial). Relative to students from underrepresented groups, students from well-represented groups in STEM scored higher on all tests (pre, post, and delayed, despite similar learning gains from pre-to-post and pre-to-delayed) and showed more engagement and less anxiety. The game also enhanced the experience of mastery only among students from well-represented groups. At the same time, students from underrepresented groups learned from the intervention and matched students from well-represented groups in learning efficiency. In short, we found similar learning gains from the game and tutor interventions among students from well-represented and underrepresented racial/ethnic groups, despite the lower performance and lower engagement among students from underrepresented groups. These insights highlight how students from diverse backgrounds may engage differently with educational technology, guiding future efforts in making Decimal Point - as well as digital learning tools in general - more inclusive.

AB Bacillus subtilis is an important industrial and environmental microorganism known to occupy many niches and produce many compounds of interest. Although it is one of the best-studied organisms, much of this focus including the reconstruction of genome-scale metabolic models has been placed on a few key laboratory strains. Here, we substantially expand these prior models to pan-genome-scale, representing 481 genomes of B. subtilis with 2,315 orthologous gene clusters, 1,874 metabolites, and 2,239 reactions. Furthermore, we incorporate data from carbon utilization experiments for eight strains to refine and validate its metabolic predictions. This comprehensive pan-genome model enables the assessment of strain-to-strain differences related to nutrient utilization, fermentation outputs, robustness, and other metabolic aspects. Using the model and phenotypic predictions, we divide B. subtilis strains into five groups with distinct patterns of behavior that correlate across these features. The pan-genome model offers deep insights into B. subtilis' metabolism as it varies across environments and provides an understanding as to how different strains have adapted to dynamic habitats. IMPORTANCEAs the volume of genomic data and computational power have increased, so has the number of genome-scale metabolic models. These models encapsulate the totality of metabolic functions for a given organism. Bacillus subtilis strain 168 is one of the first bacteria for which a metabolic network was reconstructed. Since then, several updated reconstructions have been generated for this model microorganism. Here, we expand the metabolic model for a single strain into a pan-genome-scale model, which consists of individual models for 481 B. subtilis strains. By evaluating differences between these strains, we identified five distinct groups of strains, allowing for the rapid classification of any particular strain. Furthermore, this classification into five groups aids the rapid identification of suitable strains for any application.

AB The electricity market crisis, driven by factors such as increased energy demand, rising fuel prices, aging infrastructure, and greenhouse gas emissions, requires a multifaceted approach including the strategic implementation of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies, which despite high costs and potential adverse impact on renewable investments, can allow the use of fossil fuels to maintain grid stability, and simultaneously lower carbon footprint. Across the world, several nations are designing financial incentives and improving regulatory frameworks to reduce barriers to the deployment of CCS. However, it is not clearly understood whether and to what extent such policy support would affect the incentive to invest in renewable energy technologies. Moreover, it is unclear whether existing renewable subsidies would complement or counteract power generators' prospective investments in carbon capture retrofits in the presence of CCS subsidies. This study examines the rate of change in renewable energy generation with changes in CCS subsidies as well as the rate of change in the percent of carbon captured for storage with a change in renewable energy production subsidies (cross-impact of policies). The results, under the given model framework and assumptions, indicate that (1) renewable subsidies could lower the incentive to capture a larger share of carbon dioxide emissions for permanent storage, and (2) CCS subsidies could reduce the incentive to produce more renewable energy. These results highlight the need for policy makers to consider the potential trade-offs signaled by CCS policy support.

We have formulated the problem by applying game theory to achieve maximum payoff and employing a tree diagram to integrate the sequential attack strategy systematically. Through simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating diversity and redundancy in enhancing system survival probability. Furthermore, this research presents a cost analysis to guide the optimal selection of system configurations that achieve the highest survival probability within budget constraints.

AB Transmission expansion planning (TEP) plays a vital role in ensuring the reliable and efficient operation of power systems, especially with the growing demand for electricity and the integration of renewable energy sources. This paper focuses on applying unconventional high surge impedance loading (HSIL) lines in transmission expansion planning and compares their outcomes with conventional line-based transmission expansion planning. Starting with a 17 bus- 500 kV power system connected by a conventional transmission line, the objective is to connect a new load located in a new bus, bus #18, to the existing 17-bus power system via two approaches: using conventional lines and incorporating unconventional HSIL lines. By comparing the number of lines required for the conventional and unconventional approaches, maintaining almost identical conductor volume per circuit, the effectiveness of unconventional HSIL lines in TEP is evaluated where using only two unconventional HSIL lines is sufficient to connect 1000 MW load demand at bus 18 while three lines are required when using the conventional design.

AB The goal of this paper was to establish a metric, which we refer to as the resilience parameter, to evaluate the ability of a material to retain tensile strength after damage recovery for shape memory polymer (SMP) systems. In this work, three SMP blends created for the additive manufacturing process of fused filament fabrication (FFF) were characterized. The three polymer systems examined in this study were 50/50 by weight binary blends of the following constituents: (1) polylactic acid (PLA) and maleated styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene (SEBS-g-MA); (2) acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and SEBS-g-MA); and (3) PLA and thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU). The blends were melt compounded and specimens were fabricated by way of FFF and injection molding (IM). The effect of shape memory recovery from varying amounts of initial tensile deformation on the mechanical properties of each blend, in both additively manufactured and injection molded forms, was characterized in terms of the change in tensile strength vs. the amount of deformation the specimens recovered from. The findings of this research indicated a sensitivity to manufacturing method for the PLA/TPU blend, which showed an increase in strength with increasing deformation recovery for the injection molded samples, which indicates this blend had excellent resilience. The ABS/SEBS blend showed no change in strength with the amount of deformation recovery, indicating that this blend had good resilience. The PLA/SEBS showed a decrease in strength with an increasing amount of initial deformation, indicating that this blend had poor resilience. The premise behind the development of this parameter is to promote and aid the notion that increased use of shape memory and self-healing polymers could be a strategy for mitigating plastic waste in the environment.

AB Due to the technological revolution, online reviews have become extremely valuable to consumer decision making, with approximately 93% of all consumers relying on reviews for purchasing decisions. However, the rise of fake online reviews has raised concerns about their trustworthiness, as it is estimated that 4% of all internet reviews are estimated to be fraudulent, impacting worldwide online purchases by $152 billion. This prevalence not only misleads consumers but also challenges businesses striving to maintain their reputation. Yelp, a prominent platform hosting online reviews, plays a crucial role in shaping consumer perceptions and purchasing choices. However, the presence of fake reviews on Yelp has raised integrity concerns. This research explores the use of data analysis techniques and machine learning algorithms to determine the authenticity of Yelp reviews, contributing to the enhancement of the credibility of online review systems, enabling informed decisions, and promoting fair competition among businesses.

AB Magnesium-based cement such as magnesium silicate hydrate (M-S-H) has drawn interest as a substitute for ordinary Portland cement. The precise determination of M-S-H's elastic modulus is essential in assessing the mechanical performance of M-S-H-based concrete. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) allows for spatially resolved quantification of nanomechanical characteristics of materials, including thin overgrowths on substrates. In this study, elastic modulus maps of M-S-H grown on single crystal mica surfaces were obtained using amplitude modulation-frequency modulation AFM. The effects of the Mg-to-Si molar ratio and morphology on the elastic modulus of M-S-H films were investigated. AFM reveals elastic moduli ranging from 5 to 15 and 40 to 64 GPa, depending on the growth reaction time and morphology. A comparison with calcium silicate hydrate found in traditional cement reveals insights into the influence of silicate polymerization on the material's stiffness. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of AFM in quantitatively describing the mechanical characteristics of cementitious phases and suggest that M-S-H cement has the potential for use in a variety of construction applications.

One of the defining features of this approach is its requirement for the relationship between theoretical assumptions and predictions to be laid out in a transparent and precise way. One of the (fortunate) consequences of this requirement is that it encourages researchers to debate the merits of the different assumptions at play. The present work addresses a recent attempt to overturn the dismissal of high-threshold models by getting rid of a background selective-influence assumption. However, it can be shown that the contrast process proposed to explain this violation undermines a more general assumption that we dubbed "single-item generalization." We argue that the case for the dismissal of these assumptions and the claimed support for the proposed high-threshold contrast account does not stand the scrutiny of their theoretical properties and empirical implications.

TI Text mining of practical disaster reports: Case study on Cascadia
   earthquake preparedness
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Many practical disaster reports are published daily worldwide in various forms, including after-action reports, response plans, impact assessments, and resiliency plans. These reports serve as vital resources, allowing future generations to learn from past events and better mitigate and prepare for future disasters. However, this extensive practical literature often has limited impact on research and practice due to challenges in synthesizing and analyzing the reports. In this study, we 1) present a corpus of practical reports for text mining and 2) introduce an approach to extract insights from the corpus using select text mining tools. We validate the approach through a case study examining practical reports on the preparedness of the U.S. Pacific Northwest for a magnitude 9 Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake, which has the potential to disrupt lifeline infrastructures for months. To explore opportunities and challenges associated with text mining of practical disaster reports, we conducted a brief survey of potential user groups. The case study illustrates the types of insights that our approach can extract from a corpus. Notably, it reveals potential differences in priorities between Washington and Oregon state-level emergency management, uncovers latent sentiments expressed within the reports, and identifies inconsistent vocabulary across the field. Survey results highlight that while simple tools may yield insights that are primarily interpretable by experienced professionals, more advanced tools utilizing large language models, such as Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), offer more accessible insights, albeit with known risk associated with current artificial intelligence technologies. To ensure reproducibility, all supporting data and code are made publicly available (DOI: 10.17603/ds2-9s7w-9694).

AB The development of devices that improve thermal energy management requires thermal regulation with efficiency comparable to the ratios R similar to 10(5) in electric regulation. Unfortunately, current materials and devices in thermal regulators have only been reported to achieve R similar to 10. We use atomistic simulations to demonstrate that Ferrocenyl (Fc) molecules under applied external electric fields can alter charge states and achieve high thermal switch ratios R = G(q)/G(0), where G(q) and G(0) are the high and low limiting conductances. When an electric field is applied, Fc molecules are positively charged, and the SAM-Au interfacial interaction is strong, leading to high heat conductance G(q). On the other hand, with no electric field, the Fc molecules are charge neutral and the SAM-Au interfacial interaction is weak, leading to low heat conductance G(0). We optimized various design parameters for the device performance, including the Au-to-Au gap distance L, the system operation temperature T, the net charge on Fc molecules q, the Au surface charge number Z, and the SAM number N. We find that G(q) can be very large and increases with increasing q, Z, or N, while G(0) is near 0 at L > 3.0 nm. As a result, R > 100 was achieved for selected parameter ranges reported here.

AB To accommodate the growing demand for electricity, a novel transmission line design has been proposed. This proposed structure must undergo rigorous evaluation to ensure it complies with existing safety standards. As magnetic field and electric field are crucial for the safety of systems and their surroundings, the proposed line must adhere to established limits. This paper presents a comparison of the electric field generated by a newly proposed unconventional overhead line compared to a conventional line where electric field is calculated for each subconductor individually. The results demonstrate that the unconventional transmission line exhibits a more favorable electric field profile compared to the conventional line.

In the context of low-cost chip integrated photonic packaged sensors, in this paper we will experimentally demonstrate a method for active tuning of interferometer fringes using phase change materials that will potentially overcome fabrication induced variation of interference fringe wavelengths, thus allowing sensor chip packaging with a fixed wavelength laser and available integrated photodetectors.

AB Teachers are agents of change, yet little is known about how computing teachers' identities motivate change and propel justice-related work. To fill this gap, we developed case studies of four experienced high school computing teachers, analyzing data from teacher interviews and workshop participation. We found that teachers related to their students through personal experiences and undertook computing course teaching and designing course pathways to broaden and deepen participation. Based on these findings, we recommend that teacher professional learning programs be designed to connect teacher identities and their role in furthering social justice within computing education.

AB Motor impairments caused by stroke significantly affect daily activities and reduce quality of life, highlighting the need for effective rehabilitation strategies. This study presents a novel approach to classifying motor tasks using EEG data from acute stroke patients, focusing on left-hand motor imagery, right-hand motor imagery, and rest states. By using advanced source localization techniques, such as Minimum Norm Estimation (MNE), dipole fitting, and beamforming, integrated with a customized Residual Convolutional Neural Network (ResNetCNN) architecture, we achieved superior spatial pattern recognition in EEG data. Our approach yielded classification accuracies of 91.03% with dipole fitting, 89.07% with MNE, and 87.17% with beamforming, markedly surpassing the 55.57% to 72.21% range of traditional sensor domain methods. These results highlight the efficacy of transitioning from sensor to source domain in capturing precise brain activity. The enhanced accuracy and reliability of our method hold significant potential for advancing brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) in neurorehabilitation. This study emphasizes the importance of using advanced EEG classification techniques to provide clinicians with precise tools for developing individualized therapy plans, potentially leading to substantial improvements in motor function recovery and overall patient outcomes. Future work will focus on integrating these techniques into practical BCI systems and assessing their long-term impact on stroke rehabilitation.

SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A

DT Article
ID LAYERED OXIDE CATHODES; CAPACITY; COBALT
AB The demand for high-energy-density lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) has driven intensive research into cathode materials that exhibit both superior performance and stability over multiple charge-discharge cycles. This work focuses on enhancing the dynamic stability of single-crystal (SC) low-cobalt (Co) nickel-rich (Ni-rich) cathode materials, crucial for the advancement of LIB technology. The proposed strategy involves co-doping of iron (Fe) and aluminum (Al) with an optimized composition to mitigate the capacity degradation and voltage fading observed for traditional Ni-rich (>= 90%) cathodes. Through a comprehensive investigation combining theoretical modeling, material synthesis, and electrochemical characterization, the synergistic effects of Fe/Al co-doping are elucidated. The presence of Fe and Al ions in the crystal lattice not only stabilizes the structural integrity but also facilitates the suppression of phase transformation and surface degradation during cycling. Moreover, the incorporation of Fe and Al ions optimizes the lithium (Li)-ion diffusion kinetics and enhances the electronic conductivity, leading to improved electrochemical performance. The achieved dynamic stability of the co-doped SC cathode material enables prolonged cycle life and high-rate capability, making it a promising candidate for next-generation LIBs.

AB The analysis and interpretation of high-dimensional biological data sets is a challenging task. Exploratory data analysis of count data produced by next-generation sequencing technologies presents a common hurdle to researchers. Biologists often find it difficult to get started with the analysis process, which can be time consuming and repetitive. With the freeCount analysis framework students and researchers are guided through the iterative steps of data assessment, processing, and analysis in a visual environment. The freeCount analysis framework takes advantage of the reactive features of R Shiny to deliver a set of modular and interactive tools and tutorials for the structured analysis and visualization of count data.

AB Highly-dynamic (HD) map is an indispensable building block in the future of autonomous driving, allowing for fine-grained environmental awareness, precise localization, and route planning. However, since HD maps include rich, multidimensional information, the volume of HD map data is substantial and cannot be transmitted frequently by several vehicles over vehicular networks in real-time. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a data source selection scheme for effective HD map transmissions in vehicular named data networking (NDN) scenarios. To achieve our goal, we created a vehicular NDN environment for data collection, processing, and transmission using the CARLA simulator and robot operating system 2 (ROS2). Next, due to our vehicular NDN's dynamic and complex nature, we formulate the data source selection problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and solve it using a reinforcement learning approach. For simplicity, we termed our proposed scheme data source optimization with reinforcement learning (DSORL), which selects suitable vehicles for HD map data transmission to MEC servers. The experiment results indicate that our suggested method outperformed existing baseline schemes, such as RLSS, Pro-RTT, and HDM-RTT, across all performance criteria in the evaluation. For instance, the system throughput increases by 65% - 72.68% compared to other baseline systems. Similarly, the proposed approach can minimize packet loss rate, data size, and transmission time by up to 60.6%, 77.5%, and 54.1%, respectively.

AB Quantum information science and engineering (QISE) is a rapidly developing field that leverages the skills of experts from many disciplines to utilize the potential of quantum systems in a variety of applications. It requires talent from a wide variety of traditional fields, including physics, engineering, chemistry, and computer science, to name a few. To prepare students for such opportunities, it is important to give them a strong foundation in the basics of QISE, in which quantum computing plays a central role. In this study, we discuss the development, validation, and evaluation of a Quantum Interactive Learning Tutorial, on the basics and applications of quantum computing. These include an overview of key quantum mechanical concepts relevant to quantum computation (including ways a quantum computer is different from a classical computer), properties of single- and multiqubit systems, and the basics of single-qubit quantum gates. The tutorial uses guided inquiry-based teaching-learning sequences. Its development and validation involved conducting cognitive task analysis from both expert and student perspectives and using common student difficulties as a guide. For example, before engaging with the tutorial, after traditional lecture-based instruction, one reasoning primitive that was common in student responses is that a major difference between an N-bit classical and N-qubit quantum computer is that various things associated with a number N for a classical computer should be replaced with the number 2N N for a quantum computer (e.g., 2N N qubits must be initialized and 2N N bits of information are obtained as the output of the computation on the quantum computer). This type of reasoning primitive also led many students to incorrectly think that there are only N distinctly different states available when computation takes place on a classical computer. Research suggests that this type of reasoning primitive has its origins in students learning that quantum computers can provide exponential advantage for certain problems, e.g., Shor's algorithm for factoring products of large prime numbers, and that the quantum state during the computation can be in a superposition of 2N N linearly independent states. The inquiry-based learning sequences in the tutorial provide scaffolding support to help students develop a functional understanding. The final version of the validated tutorial was implemented in two distinct courses offered by the physics department with slightly different student populations and broader course goals. Students' understanding was evaluated after traditional lecture-based instruction on the requisite concepts and again after engaging with the tutorial. We analyze and discuss their improvement in performance on concepts covered in the tutorial.

AB With the integration of connected devices, artificial intelligence, and heterogeneous networks in IoT-driven cyber-physicalsystems, our society is evolving as a smart, automated, and connected community. In such dynamic and distributed envi-ronments, various operations are carried out considering different contextual factors to support the automation of connecteddevices and systems. These devices often perform long-lived operations or tasks (referred to as activities) to fulfill larger goalsin the connected environment. These activities are usually mutable (change states) and interdependent. They can influence theexecution of other activities in the ecosystem, requiringactiveand real-time monitoring of the entire connected environment.Traditional access control models are designed to take authorization decisions at the time of access request and do not fitwell in dynamic and connected environments, which require continuous active checks on dependent and mutable activities.Recently, a vision for activity-centric access control (ACAC) was proposed to enable security modeling and enforcementfrom the perspective and abstraction of interdependent activities. The proposed ACAC incorporates four decision parameters:Authorizations (A), oBligations (B), Conditions (C), and activity Dependencies (D) for anobject agnosticcontinuous accesscontrol in smart systems. In this paper, we take a step further towards maturing ACAC by focusing on the mutability of activ-ities (the ability of changing states of activities), activity dependencies (D) and developing a family of formal mathematicallygrounded models, referred to as ACAC(D). We propose six practically suitable sub-models for ACAC(D )to support the statetransition of a mutable activity incorporating the dependent activities' state-check and state-update procedures. These formalmodels consider the real-time mutability of activities as a critical factor in resolvingactivedependencies among various activ-ities in the ecosystem. Activity dependencies can form a chain where it is possible to have dependencies of dependencies. InACAC, we also consider the chain of dependencies while handling the mutability of an activity. We highlight the challenges(such as multiple dependency paths, race conditions, circular dependencies, and deadlocks) while dealing with a chain ofdependencies, and provide solutions to resolve these challenges. We also present a proof of concept implementation of ourproposed ACAC(D )models with performance analysis for a smart farming use case. This paper addresses the formal models'intended behavior while supporting activities' dependencies. Specifically, it focuses on developing and categorizing mathe-matically grounded activity dependencies into various ACAC sub-models without formal policy specification and analysis oftheoretical complexities, which are intentionally kept out of the scope of this work.

AB This brief review outlines sustainable and innovative approaches involving electrochemical processes to transform organic waste materials into valuable products. This is defined as electrochemical valorization of organic waste (EVOW). By exploring the waste management landscape, EVOW could significantly contribute to global sustainability goals. This analysis highlights some of the most recent advances in EVOW, focusing on high -volume sources like municipal solid waste, food waste, and synthetic organic waste like plastics. This perspective emphasizes the need for economically viable reactor designs, durable electrodes, and a better understanding of electrocatalytic and electrochemical separation paths. Despite progress, translating theoretical studies into industrial applications remains a challenge, requiring further exploration of economic considerations, life cycle analysis, and scalable technologies. This paper provides insights into advancements, challenges, and prospects, guiding future research for sustainable waste management practices.

AB Though facial models for telepresence have made significant progress in recent years, most model reconstruction techniques still suffer from artifacts or deficiencies that result in the uncanny valley problem when used for real-time communication. In this paper, we propose an optimized approach that makes use of direct texture transfer and reduces the inconsistencies present in many facial modeling algorithms. By mapping the source texture from a 2D image to a rough 3D facial mesh, detailed features are preserved, while still allowing a 3D perspective view of the face. Moreover, we accomplish this in real time with a single, monocular camera.

   Detector; Explainability; SHAP
AB As the focus on security of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming paramount, research on crafting and inserting optimal adversarial perturbations has become increasingly critical. In the malware domain, this adversarial sample generation relies heavily on the accuracy and placement of crafted perturbation with a goal to evade a trained classifier. This work focuses on applying explainability techniques to enhance the adversarial evasion attack on a machine-learning-based Windows PE malware detector. The explainable tool identifies the regions of PE malware files that have the most significant impact on the decision-making process of a given malware detector, and therefore, the same regions can be leveraged to inject the adversarial perturbation for maximum efficiency. Profiling all the PE malware file regions based on their impact on the malware detector's decision enables the derivation of an efficient strategy for identifying the optimal location for perturbation injection. The strategy should incorporate the region's significance in influencing the malware detector's decision and the sensitivity of the PE malware file's integrity towards modifying that region.
   To assess the utility of explainable AI in crafting an adversarial sample of Windows PE malware, we utilize DeepExplainer module of SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for determining the contribution of each region of PE malware to its detection by a CNN-based malware detector, MalConv. The analysis includes both local and global explanations for the given malware samples. We performed the functionality-preserving adversarial perturbation injection in different regions of PE malware wherever possible while performing non-functionality-preserving operations in a few remaining regions. This approach allows us to examine the relationship between SHAP values and the evasion rate of the adversarial attack. Furthermore, we analyzed the significance of SHAP values at a more granular level by subdividing each section of Windows PE into small subsections. We then performed an adversarial evasion attack on the subsections based on the corresponding SHAP values of the byte sequences. Our experimental evaluation shows a significant improvement in the success and efficiency of adversarial evasion attacks when injecting the perturbation in PE malware locations based on SHAP values compared to random PE locations.

AB Neural network pruning, particularly channel pruning, is a widely used technique for compressing deep learning models to enable their deployment on edge devices with limited resources. Typically, redundant weights or structures are removed to achieve the target resource budget. Although data-driven pruning approaches have proven to be more effective, they cannot be directly applied to federated learning (FL), which has emerged as a popular technique in edge computing applications, because of distributed and confidential datasets. In response to this challenge, we design a new network pruning method for FL. We propose device-wise sub-networks for each device, assuming that the data distribution is similar within each device. These sub-networks are generated through sub-network embeddings and a hypernetwork. To further minimize memory usage and communication costs, we permanently prune the full model to remove weights that are not useful for all devices. During the FL process, we simultaneously train the device-wise sub-networks and the base sub-network to facilitate the pruning process. We then finetune the pruned model with device-wise sub-networks to regain performance. Moreover, we provided the theoretical guarantee of convergence for our method. Our method achieves better performance and resource trade-off than other well-established network pruning baselines, as demonstrated through extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet.

AB The geologically rapid appearance of fossils of modern animal phyla within Cambrian strata is a defining characteristic of the history of life on Earth. However, temporal calibration of the base of the Cambrian Period remains uncertain within millions of years, which has resulted in mounting challenges to the concept of a discrete Cambrian explosion. We present precise zircon U-Pb dates for the lower Wood Canyon Formation, Nevada. These data demonstrate the base of the Cambrian Period, as defined by both ichnofossil biostratigraphy and carbon isotope chemostratigraphy, was younger than 533 Mya, at least 6 My later than currently recognized. This new geochronology condenses previous age models for the Nemakit-Daldynian (early Cambrian) and, integrated with global records, demonstrates an explosive tempo to the early radiation of modern animal phyla.

DE State Machine Replication; Asynchrony; Hybrid Protocol
AB Protocols for state-machine replication (SMR) often trade off performance for resilience to network delay. In particular, protocols for asynchronous SMR tolerate arbitrary network delay but sacrifice throughput/latency when the network is fast, while partially synchronous protocols have good performance in a fast network but fail to make progress if the network experiences high delay. Existing hybrid protocols are resilient to arbitrary network delay and have good performance when the network is fast, but suffer from high overhead ("thrashing") if the network repeatedly switches between being fast and slow, e.g., in a network that is typically fast but has intermittent message delays.
   We propose Abraxas, a generic approach for constructing a hybrid protocol from any "fast" protocol Pi(fast) and asynchronous protocol Pi(slow) to achieve (1) security and performance equivalent to Pi(slow) under arbitrary network behavior, and (2) performance equivalent to Pi(fast) when conditions are favorable. We instantiate Abraxas with the best existing protocols for Pi(fast) (Jolteon) and Pi(slow) (2-chain VABA), and show experimentally that the resulting protocol significantly outperforms Ditto, the previous state-of-the-art hybrid protocol.

DE Digital twin; Synthetic data; Clinical trial
ID HEALTH; RECORDS
AB Clinical trial digital twins are virtual patients that reflect personal characteristics in a high degree of granularity and can be used to simulate various patient outcomes under different conditions. With the growth of clinical trial databases captured by Electronic Data Capture (EDC) systems, there is a growing interest in using machine learning models to generate digital twins. This can benefit the drug development process by reducing the sample size required for participant recruitment, improving patient outcome predictive modeling, and mitigating privacy risks when sharing synthetic clinical trial data. However, prior research has mainly focused on generating Electronic Healthcare Records (EHRs), which often assume large training data and do not account for personalized synthetic patient record generation. In this paper, we propose a sample-efficient method TWIN for generating personalized clinical trial digital twins. TWIN can produce digital twins of patient-level clinical trial records with high fidelity to the targeting participant's record and preserves the temporal relations across visits and events. We compare our method with various baselines for generating real-world patient-level clinical trial data. The results show that TWIN generates synthetic trial data with high fidelity to facilitate patient outcome predictions in low-data scenarios and strong privacy protection against real patients from the trials.(1)

AB Reality Distortion Room (RDR) is a proof-of-concept augmented reality system using projection mapping and unencumbered interaction with the Microsoft RoomAlive system to study a user's locomotive response to visual effects that seemingly transform the physical room the user is in. This study presents five effects that augment the appearance of a physical room to subtly encourage user motion. Our experiment demonstrates users' reactions to the different distortion and augmentation effects in a standard living room, with the distortion effects projected as wall grids, furniture holograms, and small particles in the air. The augmented living room can give the impression of becoming elongated, wrapped, shifted, elevated, and enlarged. The study results support the implementation of AR experiences in limited physical spaces by providing an initial understanding of how users can be subtly encouraged to move throughout a room.

AB In offline model-based reinforcement learning (offline MBRL), we learn a dynamic model from historically collected data, and subsequently utilize the learned model and fixed datasets for policy learning, without further interacting with the environment. Offline MBRL algorithms can improve the efficiency and stability of policy learning over the model-free algorithms. However, in most of the existing offline MBRL algorithms, the learning objectives for the dynamic models and the policies are isolated from each other. Such an objective mismatch may lead to inferior performance of the learned agents. In this paper, we address this issue by developing an iterative offline MBRL framework, where we maximize a lower bound of the true expected return, by alternating between dynamic-model training and policy learning. With the proposed unified model-policy learning framework, we achieve competitive performance on a wide range of continuous-control offline reinforcement learning datasets.

AB This research seeks to benefit the software engineering society by providing a simple yet effective pre-processing approach to achieve equalized odds fairness in machine learning software. Fairness issues have attracted increasing attention since machine learning software is increasingly used for high-stakes and high-risk decisions. It is the responsibility of all software developers to make their software accountable by ensuring that the machine learning software do not perform differently on different sensitive demographic groups-satisfying equalized odds. Different from prior works which either optimize for an equalized odds related metric during the learning process like a black-box, or manipulate the training data following some intuition; this work studies the root cause of the violation of equalized odds and how to tackle it. We found that equalizing the class distribution in each demographic group with sample weights is a necessary condition for achieving equalized odds without modifying the normal training process. In addition, an important partial condition for equalized odds (zero average odds difference) can be guaranteed when the class distributions are weighted to be not only equal but also balanced (1:1). Based on these analyses, we proposed FairBalance, a pre-processing algorithm which balances the class distribution in each demographic group by assigning calculated weights to the training data. On eight real-world datasets, our empirical results show that, at low computational overhead, the proposed pre-processing algorithm FairBalance can significantly improve equalized odds without much, if any damage to the utility. FairBalance also outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in terms of equalized odds. To facilitate reuse, reproduction, and validation, we made our scripts available at https://github.com/hil-se/FairBalance.

TI Adaptive hierarchical origami-based metastructures
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS

DT Article
ID DESIGN; SHAPE
AB Shape-morphing capabilities are crucial for enabling multifunctionality in both biological and artificial systems. Various strategies for shape morphing have been proposed for applications in metamaterials and robotics. However, few of these approaches have achieved the ability to seamlessly transform into a multitude of volumetric shapes post-fabrication using a relatively simple actuation and control mechanism. Taking inspiration from thick origami and hierarchies in nature, we present a hierarchical construction method based on polyhedrons to create an extensive library of compact origami metastructures. We show that a single hierarchical origami structure can autonomously adapt to over 103 versatile architectural configurations, achieved with the utilization of fewer than 3 actuation degrees of freedom and employing simple transition kinematics. We uncover the fundamental principles governing theses shape transformation through theoretical models. Furthermore, we also demonstrate the wide-ranging potential applications of these transformable hierarchical structures. These include their uses as untethered and autonomous robotic transformers capable of various gait-shifting and multidirectional locomotion, as well as rapidly self-deployable and self-reconfigurable architecture, exemplifying its scalability up to the meter scale. Lastly, we introduce the concept of multitask reconfigurable and deployable space robots and habitats, showcasing the adaptability and versatility of these metastructures.
   Enabling complex shape morphing in engineering systems remains a significant challenge. In this work, authors demonstrate that a transformer-like hierarchical origami metastructure can self-reconfigure into over 1000 versatile structures with fewer than 3 actuation degrees of freedom and simple control.

AB We present a fully parallel digital memcomputing solver implemented on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) board. For this purpose, we have designed an FPGA code that solves the ordinary differential equations associated with digital memcomputing in parallel. A feature of the code is the use of only integer-type variables and integer constants to enhance optimization. Consequently, each integration step in our solver is executed in 96 ns. This method was utilized for difficult instances of the Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem close to a phase transition, involving up to about 150 variables. Our results demonstrate that the parallel implementation reduces the scaling exponent by about 1 compared to a sequential C++ code on a standard computer. Additionally, compared to C++ code, we observed a time-to-solution advantage of about three orders of magnitude. Given the limitations of FPGA resources, the current implementation of digital memcomputing will be especially useful for solving compact but challenging problems.

ID NONVOLATILE MEMORY; ARCHITECTURES; RELIABILITY
AB Energy harvesting system has huge potential to enable battery-less Internet of Things (IoT) services. However, it has been designed without a cache due to the difficulty of crash consistency guarantee, limiting its performance. This paper introduces Write-Light Cache (WL-Cache), a specialized cache architecture with a new write policy for energy harvesting systems. WL-Cache combines benefits of a write-back cache and a write-through cache while avoiding their downsides. Unlike a write-through cache, WL-Cache does not access a non-volatile main memory (NVM) at every store but it holds dirty cache lines in a cache to exploit locality, saving energy and improving performance. Unlike a write-back cache, WL-Cache limits the number of dirty lines in a cache. When power is about to be cut off, WL-Cache flushes the bounded set of dirty lines to NVM in a failure-atomic manner by leveraging a just-in-time (JIT) check-pointing mechanism to achieve crash consistency across power failure. For optimization, WL-Cache interacts with a run-time system that estimates the quality of energy source during each power-on period, and adaptively reconfigures the possible number of dirty cache lines at boot time. Our experiments demonstrate that WL-Cache reduces hardware complexity and provides a significant speedup over the state-of-the-art volatile cache design with non-volatile backup. For two representative power outage traces, WL-Cache achieves 1.35x and 1.44x average speedups, respectively, across 23 benchmarks used in prior work.

AB Research-based multiple-choice questions implemented in class with peer instruction have been shown to be an effective tool for improving students' engagement and learning outcomes. Moreover, multiplechoice questions that are carefully sequenced to build on each other can be particularly helpful for students to develop a systematic understanding of concepts pertaining to a theme. Here, we discuss the development, validation, and implementation of a multiple-choice question sequence (MQS) on the topic of quantum measurement in the context of wave functions in the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. This MQS was developed using students' common difficulties with quantum measurements as a guide and was implemented in a junior-/senior-level quantum mechanics course at a large research university in the U.S. We compare student performance on assessment tasks focusing on quantum measurement before and after the implementation of the MQS and discuss how different difficulties were reduced and how to further improve students' conceptual understanding of quantum measurement in infinite-dimensional Hilbert space.

AB There has been considerable research on confusion and frustration that has treated them as two unitary constructs, distinct from each other. In this article, we argue that there is instead a constellation of different types of confusion and frustration, with different antecedents, manifestations, and impacts, and that the commonalities between many types of confusion and frustration justify thinking of them as part of the same constellation of affect, distinct from other prominent affective categories. We discuss how these types of affect have been considered historically and in key models. We then discuss unusual manifestations of each form of affect that have been documented in the literature, and what light they shed on the broader constructs. We conclude with a discussion of a new theoretical framing that treats confusion and frustration as a confrustion constellation, and the opportunities and open questions that this perspective presents.

AB This paper studies the generation of cryptographic keys from wireless channels in light-fidelity (LiFi) networks. Unlike existing studies, we account for several practical considerations (a) realistic indoor multi-user mobility scenarios, (b) non-ideal channel reciprocity given the unique characteristics of the downlink visible light (VL) and uplink infrared (IR) channels, (c) different room occupancy levels, (d) different room layouts, and (e) different receivers' field-of-view (FoV). Since general channel models in dynamic LiFi networks are inaccurate, we propose a novel deep learning-based framework to generate secret keys with minimal key disagreement rate (KDR) and maximal key generation rate (KGR). However, we find that wireless channels in LiFi networks exhibit different statistical behaviors under various conditions, leading to concept drift in the deep learning model. As a result, key generation suffers from (a) a deterioration in KDR and KGR up to 29% and 38%, respectively, and (b) failing the NIST randomness test. To enable a concept drift aware framework, we propose an adaptive learning strategy using the similarity of channel probability density functions and the mix-of-experts ensemble method. Results show our adaptive learning strategy can achieve stable performance that passes the NIST randomness test and achieves 8% KDR and 89 bits/s KGR for a case of study with 60 degrees FoV.

AB We examine students' challenges in determining the number of distinct many-particle stationary states for a system of noninteracting identical particles, focusing on how these insights guided the design, validation, and evaluation of a quantum interactive learning tutorial (QuILT) to aid students' understanding. Specifically, we focus on systems with a fixed number of available single-particle states and particles, where the total energy is not fixed. The QuILT is designed to provide scaffolding support to help students learn these complex concepts more effectively. This study was conducted in advanced quantum mechanics courses, where written questions were administered to students in class following traditional instruction on the relevant concepts. Additionally, individual interviews were conducted with students to gain deeper insights. Our findings reveal that both upper-level undergraduate and graduate students face similar challenges in understanding these concepts. Additionally, difficulty with basic concepts in combinatorics that are necessary to answer the questions correctly was also found. The QuILT offers scaffolding support to help undergraduate and graduate students systematically reason through these concepts.

AB As climate change intensifies, the global imperative to shift towards sustainable energy sources becomes more pronounced. Photovoltaic (PV) energy is a favored choice due to its reliability and ease of installation. Accurate mapping of PV installations is crucial for understanding their adoption and informing energy policy. To meet this need, we introduce the SolarFormer, designed to segment solar panels from aerial imagery, offering insights into their location and size. However, solar panel identification in Computer Vision is intricate due to various factors like weather conditions, roof conditions, and Ground Sampling Distance (GSD) variations. To tackle these complexities, we present the SolarFormer, featuring a multi-scale Transformer encoder and a masked-attention Transformer decoder. Our model leverages low-level features and incorporates an instance query mechanism to enhance the localization of solar PV installations. We rigorously evaluated our SolarFormer using diverse datasets, including GGE (France), IGN (France), and USGS (California, USA), across different GSDs. Our extensive experiments consistently demonstrate that our model either matches or surpasses state-of-the-art models, promising enhanced solar panel segmentation for global sustainable energy initiatives. Source code is available upon acceptance.

AB Most existing dynamic or runtime channel pruning methods have to store all weights to achieve efficient inference, which brings extra storage costs. Static pruning methods can reduce storage costs directly, but their performance is limited by using a fixed sub-network to approximate the original model. Most existing pruning works suffer from these drawbacks because they were designed to only conduct either static or dynamic pruning. In this paper, we propose a novel method to solve both efficiency and storage challenges via simultaneously conducting dynamic and static channel pruning for convolutional neural networks. We propose a new bi-level optimization based model to naturally integrate the static and dynamic channel pruning. By doing so, our method enjoys benefits from both sides, and the disadvantages of dynamic and static pruning are reduced. After pruning, we permanently remove redundant parameters and then finetune the model with dynamic flexibility. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets suggest that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to existing dynamic and static channel pruning methods.

AB Anonymous networks have been utilized to protect user anonymity. However, such networks have been a platform for network attacks. Therefore, detecting anonymous network traffic is critical for defending a network. Many machine learning and deep learning-based approaches have been proposed. However, many of them rely heavily on labeled data and have intricate structures, which may degrade their real-time performance. Aiming to mitigate these issues, this study proposes a lightweight system to detect real-time anonymous network traffic by harnessing the principles of reinforcement learning. Initially, the historical traces of anonymous traffic are analyzed to identify the attributes that characterize anonymous and regular network traffic. Building on these important attributes, we design three components: states, actions, and rewards. Operating autonomously, the system employs these elements to discern network traffic categories in an unsupervised mode. Empirical results demonstrate that the system can identify patterns in anonymous traffic with an accuracy rate surpassing 80%.

AB Accessibility is a key aspect in ensuring the development of inclusive software. Unfortunately, research demonstrates that a large portion of software today is not created in an accessible manner. Problematically, students may not understand how to create accessible software, additionally misunderstanding the importance of creating accessible software. To fill the gap in accessibility education, we have created a comprehensive collection of labs, collectively referred to as Accessible Learning Labs (ALL). They have the primary objectives of educating participants on how to properly create accessible software, simultaneously illustrating the need to create inclusive and accessible software. In addition, the lab activities enable students to experience the implications of inaccessible software and make repairs based on their experience, making the software in the labs accessible. This will benefit many members of the software engineering community, ranging from beginning-level students to experienced practitioners who want to ensure that they are properly creating accessible and inclusive software. Complete project material is publicly available on the project website: https://all.rit.edu

AB As Quantum Computers "ontinu increase in size, throughput has not increased proportionally Ill. Errors in qubit measurement and gate operations continue to increase with circuit width and depth. In order to maximize machine throughput, researchers have begun exploring ways of parallelizing circuit execution [2]-[9]. Due to the noisyness of quantum computers, this requires new algorithms for efficient resource allocation, qubit mapping, and scheduling. We improve on existing greedy algorithms by formulating the mapping search as a Binary Integer Non-Linear Programming (BENU') problem. We model practical constraints and propose new heuristics for determining the goodness of a mapping. We evaluate our mappings on several sets of benchmark circuits and investigate the usefulness of parallel execution for circuit cutting, QAOAs, and deep circuits. We observe similar fidelity compared to Qiskit's transpiler for circuit cutting and throughput benchmarks. We observe greater fidelity over Qiskit's transpiler for dense QAOA ansatzes. Filially, we find that parallel circuit cutting provides greater fidelity than full-circuit execution.

AB Wnt signaling plays a key role in the mature CNS by regulating trafficking of NMDA-type glutamate receptors and intrinsic properties of neurons. The Wnt receptor ROR2 has been identified as a necessary component of the neuronal Wnt5a/Ca2+ signaling pathway that regulates synaptic and neuronal function. Since ROR2 is considered a pseudokinase, its mechanism for downstream signaling upon ligand binding has been controversial. It has been suggested that its role is to function as a coreceptor of a G-protein-coupled Wnt receptor of the Frizzled family. We show that chemically induced homodimerization of ROR2 is sufficient to recapitulate key signaling events downstream of receptor activation in neurons, including PKC and JNK kinases activation, elevation of somatic and dendritic Ca2+ levels, and increased trafficking of NMDARs to synapses. In addition, we show that homodimerization of ROR2 induces phosphorylation of the receptor on Tyr residues. Point mutations in the conserved but presumed nonfunctional ATP-binding site of the receptor prevent its phosphorylation, as well as downstream signaling. This suggests an active kinase domain. Our results indicate that ROR2 can signal independently of Frizzled receptors to regulate the trafficking of a key synaptic tion can overcome structural conformations that render the tyrosine kinase inactive. A better understanding of ROR2 signaling is crucial for comprehending the regulation of synaptic and neuronal function in normal brain processes in mature animals.

AB Algorithmic recourse, or providing recommendations to individuals who receive an unfavorable outcome from an algorithmic system on how they can take action and change that outcome, is an important tool for giving individuals agency against algorithmic decision systems. Unfortunately, research on algorithmic recourse faces a fundamental challenge: there are no publicly available datasets on algorithmic recourse. In this work, we begin to explore a solution to this challenge by creating an agent-based simulation called The Game Of Recourse (an homage to Conway's Game of Life) to synthesize realistic algorithmic recourse data. We designed The Game Of Recourse with a focus on reliability and fairness, two areas of critical importance in socio-technical systems.

AB In Augmented and Virtual Reality, accurate eye tracking is a requirement for many applications. Though state-of-the art algorithms have enabled sub-degree accuracy for line-of-sight tracking, one remaining problem is that depth tracking, i.e. calculation of the gaze intersection at various depths, is still inaccurate. In this paper, we propose a 3D calibration method that accounts for gaze depth in addition to line-of-sight. By taking advantage of 3D calibration points and modeling the relationship between gaze inaccuracy and depth, we show that we can improve depth calculations and better determine the 3D position of gaze intersections in virtual environments.

AB Predicting future discontinuous phenomena that are unobservable from training data sets has long been a challenging problem in scientific machine learning. We introduce a novel paradigm to predict the emergence and evolution of various discontinuities of hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) based on given training data over a short window with limited discontinuity information. Our method is inspired by the classical Roe solver [P. L. Roe, J Comput Phys., vol. 43, 1981], a basic tool for simulating various hyperbolic PDEs in computational physics. By carefully designing the computing primitives, the data flow, and the novel pseudoinverse processing module, we enable our data-driven predictor to satisfy all the essential mathematical criteria of a Roe solver and hence deliver accurate predictions of hyperbolic PDEs. We demonstrate through various examples that our data-driven Roe predictor outperforms original human-designed Roe solver and deep neural networks with weak priors in terms of accuracy and robustness.

AB We design a monotone meshfree finite difference method for linear elliptic equations in the non-divergence form on point clouds via a nonlocal relaxation method. The key idea is a novel combination of a nonlocal integral relaxation of the PDE problem with a robust mesh-free discretization on point clouds. Minimal positive stencils are obtained through a local l1-type optimization procedure that automatically guarantees the stability and, therefore, the convergence of the meshfree discretization for linear elliptic equations. A major theoretical contribution is the existence of consistent and positive stencils for a given point cloud geome-try. We provide sufficient conditions for the existence of positive stencils by finding neighbors within an ellipse (2d) or ellipsoid (3d) surrounding each interior point, generalizing the study for Poisson's equation by Seibold (Comput Methods Appl Mech Eng 198(3-4):592-601, 2008). It is well-known that wide stencils are in general needed for constructing consistent and monotone finite difference schemes for linear elliptic equations. Our result represents a significant improvement in the stencil width estimate for positive-type finite difference meth-ods for linear elliptic equations in the near-degenerate regime (when the ellipticity constant becomes small), compared to previously known works in this area. Numerical algorithms and practical guidance are provided with an eye on the case of small ellipticity constant. At the end, we present numerical results for the performance of our method in both 2d and 3d, examining a range of ellipticity constants including the near-degenerate regime.

AB We consider a personalized pricing problem in which we have data consisting of feature information, historical pricing decisions, and binary realized demand. The goal is to perform off-policy evaluation for a new personalized pricing policy that maps features to prices. Methods based on inverse propensity weighting (including doubly robust methods) for off-policy evaluation may perform poorly when the logging policy has little exploration or is deterministic, which is common in pricing applications. Building on the balanced policy evaluation framework of Kallus (2018), we propose a new approach tailored to pricing applications. The key idea is to compute an estimate that minimizes the worst-case mean squared error or maximizes a worst-case lower bound on policy performance, where in both cases the worst-case is taken with respect to a set of possible revenue functions. We establish theoretical convergence guarantees and empirically demonstrate the advantage of our approach using a real-world pricing dataset.

AB We developed a novel conceptualization of one component of creativity in narratives by integrating creativity theory and distributional semantics theory. We termed the new construct divergent semantic integration (DSI), defined as the extent to which a narrative connects divergent ideas. Across nine studies, 27 different narrative prompts, and over 3500 short narratives, we compared six models of DSI that varied in their computational architecture. The best-performing model employed Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), which generates context-dependent numerical representations of words (i.e., embeddings). BERT DSI scores demonstrated impressive predictive power, explaining up to 72% of the variance in human creativity ratings, even approaching human inter-rater reliability for some tasks. BERT DSI scores showed equivalently high predictive power for expert and nonexpert human ratings of creativity in narratives. Critically, DSI scores generalized across ethnicity and English language proficiency, including individuals identifying as Hispanic and L2 English speakers. The integration of creativity and distributional semantics theory has substantial potential to generate novel hypotheses about creativity and novel operationalizations of its underlying processes and components. To facilitate new discoveries across diverse disciplines, we provide a tutorial with code (osf.io/ath2s) on how to compute DSI and a web app (osf.io/ath2s) to freely retrieve DSI scores.

AB The spreading of information in social networks can be modelled as a process of diffusing information with a probability from its source to its neighbours. There is a challenge in the real world where competing companies implement their strategies to gain influence in the same social network at the same time. To effectively control the spreading of processes within the network, the effective use of limited resources is of prime importance. When budgets are fixed, competitors will search for a set of seed members to diffuse influence and maximise the number of members that are affected. Each competitor seeks to maximise its influence by investing in the most influential members in the given social network. In this paper, we utilise the Colonel Blotto game to help competitors figure out how many resources should be allocated to influential nodes to increase the influences on nodes. This is done while also taking into account that competing campaigns are trying to do the same thing. We propose a Max-Influence-Independent-Set (MIIS) algorithm to determine the most influential independent set and find the optimal investment to gain maximum influence in the given social network. The effectiveness of this approach is evaluated under different parameter values, namely probability distributions, topologies, and density.

AB Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) models aim to incrementally learn new classes with scarce samples while preserving knowledge of old ones. Existing FSCIL methods usually fine-tune the entire backbone, leading to overfitting and hindering the potential to learn new classes. On the other hand, recent prompt-based CIL approaches alleviate forgetting by training prompts with sufficient data in each task. In this work, we propose a novel framework named Attention-aware Self-adaptive Prompt (ASP). ASP encourages task-invariant prompts to capture shared knowledge by reducing specific information from the attention aspect. Additionally, self-adaptive task-specific prompts in ASP provide specific information and transfer knowledge from old classes to new classes with an Information Bottleneck learning objective. In summary, ASP prevents overfitting on base task and does not require enormous data in few-shot incremental tasks. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets validate that ASP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSCIL and prompt-based CIL methods in terms of both learning new classes and mitigating forgetting. Source code is available at https://github.com/DawnLIU35/FSCIL-ASP.

AB By decoupling the control plane and data plane in the software-defined network (SDN), the controller gains a comprehensive global view of the network. The SDN controller samples traffic from all switches to effectively manage data plane traffic. The sampling rate of flow traffic significantly impacts the accuracy of the controller's decisions. While increasing the sampling rate is desirable for improved detection accuracy, it also escalates resource consumption on both switches and the controller. Hence, it is crucial to carefully manage sampling on switches to fine-tune anomaly detection accuracy. Existing flow sampling solutions often struggle to strike a balance between detection accuracy, sampling rate, and overhead. To address this challenge, we propose a robust cybersecurity framework for anomaly detection on SDNs through traffic flow inspection. Our proposed framework, Cyber-AnDe, integrates adaptive distributed sampling (ADS) with a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent to enhance anomaly detection accuracy while minimizing the increase in controller overhead. In our framework, the controller leverages information gathered from each sampled traffic flow to determine whether the flow's state is malicious, suspicious, or benign based on underlying anomaly detection algorithms. Once the flow state is determined, the controller takes the appropriate action with the help of the RL agent. Through extensive simulations and SDN test-bed experiments, we confirm a significant improvement of up to 93% in network traffic-based anomaly detection compared to existing solutions.

AB The capacity of windows to transmit solar irradiance contributes significantly to indoor environments, which facilitates supplemental warmth courtesy of shortwave solar irradiance, impacting both human comfort and building energy dynamics. This study explores the impact of window glazing on indoor thermal comfort and building energy dynamics through shortwave solar irradiance. It presents a comprehensive analysis of 5,138 glazing systems and introduces a novel thermal effect index. This index was generated using a spectrally-resolved method to classify windows based on their capacity to transmit solar energy. The index divides the quantified thermal effects into 10 equally-sized ranges and assigns corresponding indices. In addition to recognizing the influence of specific solar spectral distributions on the thermal effects of glazings, this work also proposes a method for computing effective wavebands of spectral transmittance, allowing for the rapid evaluation of a window's thermal effects under diverse solar spectra. In essence, this study emphasizes the importance of the thermal effect in understanding solar energy utilization and determining implications for energy savings and enhanced indoor thermal comfort. By addressing the interplay between solar energy use and human comfort, this research offers valuable insights for future advanced envelope design and energy management strategies. With this knowledge, we will be better able to tailor advanced envelope products to meet both human needs and energy efficiency goals by harnessing solar energy.

ID DISTRIBUTED ESTIMATION
AB Distributed estimation in the context of sensor networks is considered, where distributed agents are given a set of sensor measurements, and are tasked with estimating a target variable. A subset of sensors are assumed to be faulty. The objective is to minimize i) the mean squared estimation error at each node (accuracy objective), and ii) the mean squared distance between the estimates at each pair of nodes (consensus objective). It is shown that there is an inherent tradeoff between the former and latter objectives. Assuming a general stochastic model, the sensor fusion algorithm optimizing this tradeoff is characterized through a computable optimization problem, and a Cramer-Rao type lower bound for the achievable accuracy-consensus loss is obtained. Finding the optimal sensor fusion algorithm is computationally complex. To address this, a general class of low-complexity Brooks-Iyengar Algorithms are introduced, and their performance, in terms of accuracy and consensus objectives, is compared to that of optimal linear estimators through case study simulations of various scenarios.

AB This paper explores the nexus of two emerging Internet of Things (IoT) components in precision agriculture, which requires vast amounts of agriculture fields to be monitored from air and soil for food production with efficient resource utilization. On the one hand, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have gained interest in agricultural aerial inspection due to their ubiquity and observation scale. On the other hand, agricultural IoT devices, including buried soil sensors, have gained interest in improving natural resource efficiency in crop production. In this work, the path loss and fading characteristics in wireless links between a UAV and underground (UG) nodes (Air2UG link) are studied to design a UAV altitude optimization solution. A path loss model is developed for the Air2UG link, including fading in the channel, where fading is modeled using a Rician distribution and validated using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Moreover, Rician- K is found to be dependent on the UAV altitude, which is modeled with a Gaussian function with an RMSE of 0.4-1.3 dB. Furthermore, a novel altitude optimization solution is presented to minimize the bit error rate (BER). Results show that the lowest possible altitude does not always minimize the BER. Optimizing the altitude reduces the Air2UG link BER by as much as 8.6-fold. Likewise, altitude optimization can minimize the impacts of increasing burial depth on the BER. Our results and analysis are the first in this field and can be exploited to optimize the altitude and resources of a UAV node to communicate with the sensors embedded in the soil efficiently.

AB Machine learning applications can significantly benefit from large amounts of labeled data, although the task of labeling data is notoriously challenging and time-consuming. This is particularly evident in domains involving human subjects, where labeling time-series signals often necessitates trained professionals. In this work, we introduce the Assisted Labeling Visualizer (ALVI), a system that simplifies the process of labeling data by offering an interactive user interface that visualizes synchronized video, feature-map representations, and raw time-series signals. ALVI also leverages deep learning and self-supervised learning techniques to facilitate the semi-automatic labeling of large amounts of unlabeled data. We demonstrate the capabilities of ALVI on a human activity recognition dataset to showcase its potential for enhancing the labeling process of time-series sensor data.

AB Graph neural networks (GNNs) have well documented success in various learning over graph problems, from drug discovery to recommender systems. These data hungry models however, are challenged in applications with limited available samples. Meta-learning paradigm provides principled methods to empower GNNs to learn rapidly from a few labeled data only, particularly beneficial for tasks with small datasets. Nonetheless, existing meta-learning frameworks for graphs encounter difficulties when the labeled nodes or links used during training are distant from those encountered during testing, rendering meta-learning in graph tasks challenging. In this context, current work leverages a suite of novel techniques to enhance generalization performance of learning over graphs with GNNs. A novel idea here is to further incorporate an extra adversarial update step during "adaptation" phase of conventional meta-learning algorithms. Additionally, our proposed method incorporates curvature information of the loss landscape during meta-updating to facilitate reliable knowledge transfer to downstream tasks with slightly different structures. The proposed methods are simple and with minimal computational costs on training process. Numerical experiments conducted on learning over graph problems validate the superiority of our algorithm over the existing counterparts, showcasing effectiveness when dealing with limited data resources.

AB In this paper, we focus on the problem of shrinking-horizon Model Predictive Control (MPC) in uncertain dynamic environments. We consider controlling a deterministic autonomous system that interacts with uncontrollable stochastic agents during its mission. Employing tools from conformal prediction, existing works derive high-confidence prediction regions for the unknown agent trajectories, and integrate these regions in the design of suitable safety constraints for MPC. Despite guaranteeing probabilistic safety of the closed-loop trajectories, these constraints do not ensure feasibility of the respective MPC schemes for the entire duration of the mission. We propose a shrinking-horizon MPC that guarantees recursive feasibility via a gradual relaxation of the safety constraints as new prediction regions become available online. This relaxation enforces the safety constraints to hold over the least restrictive prediction region from the set of all available prediction regions. In a comparative case study with the state of the art, we empirically show that our approach results in tighter prediction regions and verify recursive feasibility of our MPC scheme.

AB The presence of exascale computers has pushed a new boundary in computing capability, which poses performance challenges in parallel programming models on how to exploit such systems efficiently. A dominant programming model for running parallel programs is the Message Passing Interface. Among primitives provided by MPI, Alltoall is a communication-intensive operation, which is utilized by many applications and is well-known for being difficult to optimize. Alltoall algorithms can be mainly classified into flat and hierarchical. The hierarchical designs avoid the slowdown of intra-node communication by inter-node communication by decoupling them. The hierarchical designs also reduce network congestion by reducing concurrently injected messages into the network. This work demonstrates an additional benefit of hierarchical designs to improve connection scalability in RDMA networks. This is attributed to the cache thrashing happening inside network adapters. All of these advantages of hierarchical schemes collectively contribute to the network scalability of Alltoall. This motivates us to propose a further optimized hierarchical design to enhance performance and network scalability. The design is network-agnostic and evaluated on clusters with InfiniBand and Omni-Path network adapters. The proposed design achieves average latency improvements of 61.13%, 56.40%, 37.49%, and 51.90% over Open MPI + UCX, HPC-X, Intel MPI, and MVAPICH2-X at micro-benchmark level with up to 7168 cores, respectively. In addition, the evaluation at application-level with Car-Parrinello Molecular Dynamics code shows 24.98%, 40.44% and 50.48% improvement in the simulation time, compared to MVAPICH2-X, Open MPI + UCX, and Intel MPI, respectively.

AB Over-the-air federated learning (OTA-FL) is a communication-effective approach for achieving distributed learning tasks. In this paper, we aim to enhance OTA-FL by seamlessly combining sensing into the communication-computation integrated system. Our research reveals that the wireless waveform used to convey OTA-FL parameters possesses inherent properties that make it well-suited for sensing, thanks to its remarkable auto-correlation characteristics. By leveraging the OTA-FL learning statistics, i.e., means and variances of local gradients in each training round, the sensing results can be embedded therein without the need for additional time or frequency resources. Finally, by considering the imperfections of learning statistics that are neglected in the prior works, we end up with an optimized the transceiver design to maximize the OTA-FL performance. Simulations validate that the proposed method not only achieves outstanding sensing performance but also significantly lowers the learning error bound.

AB The variety of new electronic packaging technologies has grown significantly over the last 20 years as a result of market demands for higher device performance at lower costs and in less space. Those demands have pushed for heterogeneous packaging, where computer chips with different stack heights are closely packed, creating non-uniform multicore chip heat flux and temperature and additional challenges for thermal management. Without implementing an appropriate thermal management strategy for heterogeneous packages, large temperature gradients can be observed within the package, which would increase the thermal stresses on the chip and raise reliability issues. Therefore, removing excessive heat flux will improve the reliability and efficiency of those electronic components. The development of high-heat flux applications is straining the capabilities of air-cooling systems, which are nearing their limitations. Single-phase liquid cooling methods have proven to be reliable, usable, and energy-efficient methods for cooling high-heat flux devices. With the introduction of packages with multiple-chip modules (MCMs), the cold plates of future generations are expected to handle multiple hot spots at the same time. To enable the effective removal of heat from the chips, special cold plate designs for each type of package are required. Many methods may be used to improve thermohydraulic performance, including the use of improved fin designs, flow restriction to breakdown the boundary layer, and the integration of mixing mechanisms to improve the mixing between the fluid and channel walls. To mimic this real-life scenario of such packaging in high-heat flux applications, an experimental setup was designed and built. The design of the new experimental setup consists of four identical 1.2 cm x 1.2 cm ceramic heaters, each of which is connected to a separate power supply and can reach a heat flux of 140 W/cm(2). Accordingly, this mock package is capable of delivering different power levels to mimic different multicore microprocessor conditions. To give the heater the ability to move precisely in the x, y, and z directions with high precision, each heater is mounted to an XYZ linear stage. Deionized water (DI) was used as the working fluid, and a commercially available pin-fin heat sink was used to run the initial steady-state tests on the experimental rig. The tests showed how different flow rates at a constant fluid temperature and input power affect the temperatures of the heaters and the thermohydraulic performance of the heat sink. In addition, a three-dimensional numerical model has been developed and validated with experimental data in terms of heat sink pressure drop and temperatures of the heaters.

AB Recent studies have shown that graph neural networks (GNNs) exhibit strong biases towards the node degree: they usually perform satisfactorily on high-degree nodes with rich neighbor information but struggle with low-degree nodes. Existing works tackle this problem by deriving either designated GNN architectures or training strategies specifically for low-degree nodes. Though effective, these approaches unintentionally create an artificial out-of-distribution scenario, where models mainly or even only observe low-degree nodes during the training, leading to a downgraded performance for high-degree nodes that GNNs originally perform well at. In light of this, we propose a test-time augmentation framework, namely GRAPHPATCHER, to enhance test-time generalization of any GNNs on low-degree nodes. Specifically, GRAPHPATCHER iteratively generates virtual nodes to patch artificially created low-degree nodes via corruptions, aiming at progressively reconstructing target GNN's predictions over a sequence of increasingly corrupted nodes. Through this scheme, GRAPHPATCHER not only learns how to enhance low-degree nodes (when the neighborhoods are heavily corrupted) but also preserves the original superior performance of GNNs on high-degree nodes (when lightly corrupted). Additionally, GRAPHPATCHER is model-agnostic and can also mitigate the degree bias for either self-supervised or supervised GNNs. Comprehensive experiments are conducted over seven benchmark datasets and GRAPHPATCHER consistently enhances common GNNs' overall performance by up to 3.6% and low-degree performance by up to 6.5%, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/jumxglhf/GraphPatcher.

The agents wish to produce a pair of discrete random variables (U-d, V-d) with joint distribution P-Ud,P-Vd, such that P-Ud,P-Vd converges in total variation distance to a target distribution Q(U, V) as the input blocklength d is taken to be asymptotically large. Inner and outer bounds are obtained on the set of distributions Q(U, V) which can be produced given an input distribution P-X,P- Y. To this end, a bijective mapping from the set of distributions Q(U, V) to a union of star-convex sets is provided. By leveraging proof techniques from discrete Fourier analysis along with a novel randomized rounding technique, inner and outer bounds are derived for each of these star-convex sets, and by inverting the aforementioned bijective mapping, necessary and sufficient conditions on Q(U, V) and P-X,P- Y are provided under which Q(U, V) can be produced from P-X,P- Y. The bounds are applicable in NISS scenarios where the output alphabets U and V have arbitrary finite size. In case of binary output alphabets, the outer-bound recovers the previously best-known outer-bound.

AB This article discusses a generalization of the 1-dimensional multi-reference alignment problem. The goal is to recover a hidden signal from many noisy observations, where each noisy observation includes a random translation and random dilation of the hidden signal, as well as high additive noise. We propose a method that recovers the power spectrum of the hidden signal by applying a data-driven, nonlinear unbiasing procedure, and thus the hidden signal is obtained up to an unknown phase. An unbiased estimator of the power spectrum is defined, whose error depends on the sample size and noise levels, and we precisely quantify the convergence rate of the proposed estimator. The unbiasing procedure relies on knowledge of the dilation distribution, and we implement an optimization procedure to learn the dilation variance when this parameter is unknown. Our theoretical work is supported by extensive numerical experiments on a wide range of signals.

AB Since state-of-the-art machine learning models like Transformers can not handle long text well, the quality of the summarization of legal documents is still not desirable. In order to improve the ability of machine learning models to understand the context of a long document, we introduce the keywords into the models to guide the summarization to locate and capture key information from long documents such as legal cases. Different from other works leveraging keywords to enhance the model, we further investigate how keyword quality impacts summarization. To improve the performance of the summarization, we also explore different methods for effectively encoding exceptionally lengthy documents and models for keyword extraction. The experiment results demonstrated that the keywords-based augmentation method is effective for summarization and higher-quality keywords can enhance the summarization models.

AB Training deep neural networks (DNNs) with limited supervision has been a popular research topic as it can significantly alleviate the annotation burden. Self-training has been successfully applied in semi-supervised learning tasks, but one drawback of self-training is that it is vulnerable to the label noise from incorrect pseudo labels. Inspired by the fact that samples with similar labels tend to share similar representations, we develop a neighborhood-based sample selection approach to tackle the issue of noisy pseudo labels. We further stabilize self-training via aggregating the predictions from different rounds during sample selection. Experiments on eight tasks show that our proposed method outperforms the strongest self-training baseline with 1.83% and 2.51% performance gain for text and graph datasets on average. Our further analysis demonstrates that our proposed data selection strategy reduces the noise of pseudo labels by 36.8% and saves 57.3% of the time when compared with the best baseline. Our code and appendices will be uploaded to https://github.com/ritaranx/NeST.

AB Learning the distribution of a continuous or categorical response variable y given its covariates x is a fundamental problem in statistics and machine learning. Deep neural network-based supervised learning algorithms have made great progress in predicting the mean of y given x, but they are often criticized for their ability to accurately capture the uncertainty of their predictions. In this paper, we introduce classification and regression diffusion (CARD) models, which combine a denoising diffusion-based conditional generative model and a pre-trained conditional mean estimator, to accurately predict the distribution of y given x. We demonstrate the outstanding ability of CARD in conditional distribution prediction with both toy examples and real-world datasets, the experimental results on which show that CARD in general outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including Bayesian neural network-based ones that are designed for uncertainty estimation, especially when the conditional distribution of y given x is multi-modal. In addition, we utilize the stochastic nature of the generative model outputs to obtain a finer granularity in model confidence assessment at the instance level for classification tasks. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/XzwHan/CARD.

DE Large-eddy simulation; Wall-bounded turbulence; Wall model;
   Subgrid-scale modeling; Flow separation
AB In this study, we conduct a parametric analysis to evaluate the sensitivities of wall -modeled large -eddy simulation (LES) with respect to subgrid-scale (SGS) models, mesh resolution, wall boundary conditions and mesh anisotropy. While such investigations have been conducted for attached/flat-plate flow configurations, systematic studies specifically targeting turbulent flows with separation are notably sparse. To bridge this gap, our study focuses on the flow over a two-dimensional Gaussian -shaped bump at a moderately high Reynolds number, which involves smooth -body separation of a turbulent boundary layer under pressure -gradient and surfacecurvature effects. In the simulations, the no -slip condition at the wall is replaced by three different forms of boundary condition based on the thin boundary layer equations and the mean wall -shear stress from high-fidelity numerical simulation to avoid the additional complexity of modeling the wall -shear stress. Various statistics, including the mean separation bubble size, mean velocity profile, and dissipation from SGS model, are compared and analyzed. The results reveal that capturing the separation bubble strongly depends on the choice of SGS model. While simulations approach grid convergence with resolutions nearing those of wall -resolved LES meshes, above this limit, the LES predictions exhibit intricate sensitivities to mesh resolution. Furthermore, both wall boundary conditions and the anisotropy of mesh cells exert discernible impacts on the turbulent flow predictions, yet the magnitudes of these impacts vary based on the specific SGS model chosen for the simulation.

AB Despite numerous studies examining the impact of youth participation in informal physics programs, existing research primarily focuses on short-term outcomes, neglecting the long-term effects. To address this gap, we aim to develop a mixed-methods longitudinal study to understand the long-term impact of youth participation in an informal physics program. This paper focuses on a qualitative pilot study with three prior program participants and serves two purposes: (1) to gauge which elements of the informal physics program may be important to investigate further within the longitudinal study and (2) to further understand the complexities and challenges of utilizing interviews with program participants and alumni as the qualitative approach to the longitudinal study. Findings revealed diverse motivations for program participation, varying levels of program recollection, and a spectrum of impacts on participants. Building upon these findings, our planned longitudinal study will employ both quantitative and qualitative methods to gain a nuanced understanding of the long-term effects of youth engagement in informal physics programs.

AB In general, vibrational physics has been well described by quantum perturbation theory (QPT) to provide footprint characteristics for common crystals. However, despite weak phonon anharmonicity, the recently discovered cubic crystals (BAs and BP) have shown anomalous vibrational dynamics with elusive fundamental origin. Here, we developed a nonperturbative ab initio approach, together with spectroscopy and high-pressure experiments, to successfully determine the exact dynamic evolutions of the vibrational physics. We found that the local fluctuation and coupling isotopes significantly dictate the vibrational spectra, through the Brillouin zone folding that has previously been ignored in literature. By decomposing vibrational spectra into individual isotope eigenvectors, we observed both positive and negative contributions to Raman intensity from constitutional atoms (10B, 11B, 75As, or 31P). Importantly, our nonperturbative theory predicts that a vibrational resonance appears at high hydrostatic pressure due to broken translational symmetry, which was indeed verified by experimental measurement under a pressure up to 31.5 GPa. In this paper, we develop fundamental understandings for the anomalous lattice physics under the failure of QPT and provide an approach in exploring transport phenomena for materials of extreme properties.

AB For a variety of biometric cross-spectral tasks, Visible-Thermal (VT) facial pairs are used. However, due to a lack of calibration, photographic capture between two different imaging sensors leads to severely misaligned pairs that can lead to poor results for person re-identification and generative AI. To solve this problem, we introduce our approach for VT image registration called Vista Morph. Unlike existing VT facial registration that requires manual, hand-crafted features for pixel matching and/or a supervised thermal reference, Vista Morph is completely unsupervised without the need for a reference. By learning the affine matrix through a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based Spatial Transformer Network (STN) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), Vista Morph successfully aligns facial and non-facial VT images. Our approach learns warps in Hard, No, and Low-light visual settings and is robust to geometric perturbations and erasure at test time. We conduct a downstream generative AI task to show that registering training data with Vista Morph improves subject identity of generated thermal faces when performing V2T image translation.

AB Clinical trials are essential to drug development but time-consuming, costly, and prone to failure. Accurate trial outcome prediction based on historical trial data promises better trial investment decisions and more trial success. Existing trial outcome prediction models were not designed to model the relations among similar trials, capture the progression of features and designs of similar trials, or address the skewness of trial data which causes inferior performance for less common trials.
   To fill the gap and provide accurate trial outcome prediction, we propose Sequential Predictive mOdeling of clinical Trial outcome (SPOT) that first identifies trial topics to cluster the multi-sourced trial data into relevant trial topics. It then generates trial embeddings and organizes them by topic and time to create clinical trial sequences. With the consideration of each trial sequence as a task, it uses a meta-learning strategy to achieve a point where the model can rapidly adapt to new tasks with minimal updates. In particular, the topic discovery module enables a deeper understanding of the underlying structure of the data, while sequential learning captures the evolution of trial designs and outcomes. This results in predictions that are not only more accurate but also more interpretable, taking into account the temporal patterns and unique characteristics of each trial topic. We demonstrate that SPOT wins over the prior methods by a significant margin on trial outcome benchmark data: with a 21.5% lift on phase I, an 8.9% lift on phase II, and a 5.5% lift on phase III trials in the metric of the area under precision-recall curve (PR-AUC).

AB Language models are being developed and deployed in many applications, "small"-scale and large-scale, generic and specialized, text-only and multimodal, etc. Meanwhile, the missingness of important knowledge causes limitations and safety challenges. The knowledge includes commonsense, world facts, domain expertise, personalization, and especially the unique patterns that need to be discovered from big data applications. Training and inference processes of the language models can be and should be augmented with the knowledge. The first KnowledgeNLP at AAAI 2023 attracted scientists on knowledge augmentation methods towards higher language intelligence. This workshop offers a broad platform to share ideas and discuss various topics, such as (1) synergy between knowledge and language model, (2) scalable architectures that integrate NLP, knowledge graph, and graph learning technologies, (3) KnowledgeNLP for e-commerce, education, and healthcare, (4) human factors and social good in KnowledgeNLP.

AB Chess includes two significant factors: playing good moves and managing your time optimally. Time, especially in blitz games, is just as essential to the game as making good moves. Nowadays, several incredible engines are already developed, more than enough to defeat all the best human chess players. For studying how to make good moves, these engines are crucially useful. Professional chess players are using them in addition to coaches to prepare for the matches or to examine the mistakes in their played games. However, managing time still is a huge challenge. There are no basic rules for managing time. A lot of factors influence the decision about how much time should be spent in a particular position. For computers, it is easier because they calculate much faster and they have all the theoretical knowledge. However, even grandmaster chess human players are struggling with time trouble. In this article, we describe how the data was collected from an online chess platform and show methods of how time can be managed based on different features. In this regard, we will use two different models: using a customised neural network and using a proposed segmented least square approximation method. In both of the models, we will use our collected data.

AB Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have emerged as powerful techniques for adapting pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to specific tasks with reduced computational and memory overhead. However, despite their promising potential, there remains a gap in understanding how these methods perform in distributed computing settings. In this paper, we present a comprehensive characterization of the communication dynamics in distributed PEFT for LLMs. Our study emphasizes the crucial role of communication efficiency in the performance and scalability of PEFT methods when utilized across GPU clusters. Through systematic analysis of various PEFT techniques and LLM sizes, we have illustrated how communication overhead can significantly impact throughput, training time, and overall model performance. Our findings indicate that PEFT methods inherently reduce communication and computational burdens compared to full fine-tuning. These improvements yield up to 1.75x speedup by using PEFT methods such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune GPT-like billion parameter generative LLMs. We conduct this characterization study on modern GPU clusters with InfiniBand interconnect with up to 32 NVIDIA A100 GPUs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort that evaluates the performance of PEFT methods in distributed computing environments. Ultimately, this work strives to provide valuable insights into the efficacy and practical implications of employing PEFT methods and facilitate the development of scalable approaches for fine-tuning large-scale models.

AB Chatbots based on state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) hold potential to act as beneficial educational tools. However, challenges to LLMs in education include concerns about not only the accuracy and interpretability of AI-generated text, but also about productive student engagement and positive user experience with LLM chatbots. In this paper, we introduce a physics education chatbot called NewtBot. We designed NewtBot to act as a personalized automated tutor to support secondary students' learning as they complete physics tasks. NewtBot's web interface has a modifiable back-end that internally prompts GPT-3.5 to produce different LLM behaviors. In a user study with German secondary school students (n=50), we evaluated student interactions with three different configurations of the GPT-3.5 back-end: a general-purpose "baseline" model, a setting-specific "tutor" model, and a problem-specific "feedback" model. We find that students had overall positive experiences using NewtBot, and that the setting-specific "tutor" model had the highest user experience ratings. Additionally, despite a majority of participants (72%) expressing apprehensions about using chatbots for school, 70% said they would use NewtBot to help with their physics school work.

AB Current techniques for deep neural network (DNN) pruning often involve intricate multi-step processes that require domain-specific expertise, making their widespread adoption challenging. To address the limitation, the Only-Train-Once (OTO) and OTOv2 are proposed to eliminate the need for additional fine-tuning steps by directly training and compressing a general DNN from scratch. Nevertheless, the static design of optimizers (in OTO) can lead to convergence issues of local optima. In this paper, we proposed the Auto-Train-Once (ATO), an innovative network pruning algorithm designed to automatically reduce the computational and storage costs of DNNs. During the model training phase, our approach not only trains the target model but also leverages a controller network as an architecture generator to guide the learning of target model weights. Furthermore, we developed a novel stochastic gradient algorithm that enhances the coordination between model training and controller network training, thereby improving pruning performance. We provide a comprehensive convergence analysis as well as extensive experiments, and the results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across various model architectures (including ResNet18, ResNet34, ResNet50, ResNet56, and MobileNetv2) on standard benchmark datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet). The code is available at https://github.com/xidongwu/AutoTrainOnce.

We present findings from the implementation of a research-validated multiple-choice question sequence on concepts relating to and various methods of changing basis for two-state systems. This study was conducted in an advanced undergraduate quantum mechanics course, in both online and in-person learning environments, across three years. Student learning was assessed after traditional lecture-based instruction in relevant concepts, and students' performance was compared with that on a similar assessment given after engaging with the multiple-choice question sequence. We analyze, compare, and discuss the trends observed in the three implementations.

AB Safety, liveness, and privacy are three critical properties for any private proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain. However, prior work (SP'21) has shown that to obtain safety and liveness, a PoS blockchain must in theory forgo privacy. Specifically, to ensure safety and liveness, PoS blockchains elect parties based on stake proportion, potentially exposing a party's stake even with private transaction processing. In this work, we make two key contributions. First, we present the first stake inference attack applicable to both deterministic and randomized PoS with exponentially less running time in comparison with SOTAdesigns. Second, we use differentially private stake distortion to achieve privacy in PoS blockchains, and design two stake distortion mechanisms that any PoS protocol can use. We further evaluate our proposed methods using Ethereum 2.0, a widely-recognized PoS blockchain in operation. Results demonstrate effective stake inference risk mitigation, reasonable privacy, and preservation of essential safety and liveness properties.

AB Effective non-repetitive routing among nodes in a network is an essential function in communication networks. To achieve that, pruning the links of the network is helpful with the trade-off of making the network less robust in transmitting messages while reducing redundancy to increase flow with limited network bandwidth, so we enhance the quality of service (QoS). In our paper, we study the case that if a link removal has either no effect or an insignificant effect on the Age of Information (AoI) of the messages delivered in the communication network. The pruning of such links can be applied to the k least significant links in terms of their impact on the AoI of the messages transmitted in the system. The objective of our work is to study the effect of pruning a number of links in a network on the AoI, in order to reduce the redundancy of the messages that may be received at the destination many times while transmitted only once. In our context, the objective of the communication system would be to maintain the information from the source as fresh as possible when it arrives at the destination while reducing the redundancy of messages. In this work, we introduce an efficient reduction method designed for series-parallel networks with links of exponentially distributed wait times. In addition, we consider the deterministic case and present the pruning technique when link removal would not affect the AoI. Lastly, we present a comprehensive simulation to study the effect of pruning the links on the AoI of the network and the redundancy of messages received by the destination.

AB Contextual bandit algorithms have been recently studied under the federated learning setting to satisfy the demand of keeping data decentralized and pushing the learning of bandit models to the client side. But limited by the required communication efficiency, existing solutions are restricted to linear models to exploit their closed-form solutions for parameter estimation. Such a restricted model choice greatly hampers these algorithms' practical utility. In this paper, we take the first step to addressing this challenge by studying generalized linear bandit models under the federated learning setting. We propose a communication-efficient solution framework that employs online regression for local update and offline regression for global update. We rigorously proved, though the setting is more general and challenging, our algorithm can attain sub-linear rate in both regret and communication cost, which is also validated by our extensive empirical evaluations.

SO EUROPEAN POLYMER JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB This study presents a new approach for enhancing the depolymerization efficiency of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) by incorporating multiple depolymerization sites within the polymer chains. Four distinct PMMA polymers were synthesized, each bearing different combinations of phthalimide ester and chloride, or bromide functionalities placed in specific positions in the polymer chain. The polymers were prepared by atom transfer radical polymerization. Increasing the number of activation sites enhanced the depolymerization yield. Experiments conducted under reduced pressure in bulk revealed depolymerization yields ranging from 73 % to 86 % achieved within 30 min at 220 degrees C. Thermogravimetric analysis performed on polymers with four different molecular weights demonstrated the efficiency of this approach also for polymers with higher molecular weights. A similar strategy was also performed on crosslinked networks by incorporating activatable pyromellitic moieties to reach 85 % of depolymerization yield. This strategy demonstrates the potential for efficient depolymerization of PMMA at relatively low catalyst loadings and temperatures, offering promising prospects for sustainable polymer recycling processes.

AB In atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), dormant alkyl halides are intermittently activated to form growing radicals in the presence of a Cu-I/L/X-Cu-II/L (activator/deactivator) catalytic system. Recently developed very active copper complexes could decrease the catalyst concentration to ppm level. However, unavoidable radical termination results in irreversible oxidation of the activator to the deactivator species, leading to limited monomer conversions. Therefore, successful ATRP at a low catalyst loading requires continuous regeneration of the activators. Such a regenerative ATRP can be performed with various reducing agents under milder reaction conditions and with catalyst concentrations diminished in comparison to conventional ATRP. Photoinduced ATRP (PhotoATRP) is one of the most efficient methods of activator regeneration. It initially employed UV irradiation to reduce the air-stable excited X-Cu-II/L deactivators to the activators in the presence of sacrificial electron donors. Photocatalysts (PCs) can be excited after absorbing light at longer wavelengths and, due to their favorable redox potentials, can reduce X-Cu-II/L to Cu-I/L. Herein, we present the application of three commercially available xanthene dyes as ATRP PCs: rose bengal (RB), rhodamine B (RD), and rhodamine 6G (RD-6G). Even at very low Cu catalyst concentrations (50 ppm), they successfully controlled PhotoATRP. Well-defined polymers with preserved livingness were prepared under green LED irradiation, with subppm concentrations ([PC] >= 10 ppb) of RB and RD-6G or 5 ppm of RD. Interestingly, these PCs efficiently controlled ATRP at wavelengths longer than their absorption maxima but required higher loadings. Polymerizations proceeded with high initiation efficiencies, yielding polymers with narrow molecular weight distributions and high chain-end fidelity. UV-vis, fluorescence, and laser flash photolysis studies helped to elucidate the mechanism of the processes involved in the dual-catalytic systems, comprising parts per million of Cu complexes and parts per billion of PCs.

AB The emergence of viral variants with altered phenotypes is a public health challenge underscoring the need for advanced evolutionary forecasting methods. Given extensive epistatic interactions within viral genomes and known viral evolutionary history, efficient genomic surveillance necessitates early detection of emerging viral haplotypes rather than commonly targeted single mutations. Haplotype inference, however, is a significantly more challenging problem precluding the use of traditional approaches. Here, using SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary dynamics as a case study, we show that emerging haplotypes with altered transmissibility can be linked to dense communities in coordinated substitution networks, which become discernible significantly earlier than the haplotypes become prevalent. From these insights, we develop a computational framework for inference of viral variants and validate it by successful early detection of known SARS-CoV-2 strains. Our methodology offers greater scalability than phylogenetic lineage tracing and can be applied to any rapidly evolving pathogen with adequate genomic surveillance data.

AB With the surge in cyber attacks, there is a pressing need for more robust network intrusion detection systems (IDSs). These IDSs perform at their best when they can monitor all the traffic coursing through the network, especially within a software-defined network (SDN). In an SDN configuration, the control plane and data plane operate independently, facilitating dynamic control over network flows. Typically, an IDS application resides in the control plane, or a centrally located network IDS transmits security reports to the controller. However, the controller, equipped with various control applications, may encounter challenges when analyzing substantial data, especially in the face of high traffic volumes. To enhance the processing power, detection rates, and alleviate the controller's burden, deploying multiple instances of IDS across the data plane is recommended. While deploying IDS on individual switches within the data plane undoubtedly enhances detection rates, the associated costs of installing one at each switch raise concerns. To address this challenge, this paper proposes the deployment of IDS chains across the data plane to boost detection rates while preventing controller overload. The controller directs incoming traffic through alternative paths, incorporating IDS chains; however, potential delays from retransmitting traffic through an IDS chain could extend the journey to the destination. To address these delays and optimize flow distribution, our study proposes a method to balance flow assignments to specific IDS chains with minimal delay. Our approach is validated through comprehensive testing and evaluation using a test bed and trace-based simulation, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing delays and hop counts across various traffic scenarios.

ID AGGREGATION
AB Successful training of data-intensive deep neural networks critically rely on vast, clean, and high-quality datasets. In practice however, their reliability diminishes, particularly with noisy, outlier-corrupted data samples encountered in testing. This challenge intensifies when dealing with anonymized, heterogeneous data sets stored across geographically distinct locations due to, e.g., privacy concerns. This present paper introduces robust learning frameworks tailored for centralized and federated learning scenarios. Our goal is to fortify model resilience with a focus that lies in (i) addressing distribution shifts from training to inference time; and, (ii) ensuring testtime robustness, when a trained model may encounter outliers or adversarially contaminated test data samples. To this aim, we start with a centralized setting where the true data distribution is considered unknown, but residing within a Wasserstein ball centered at the empirical distribution. We obtain robust models by minimizing the worst-case expected loss within this ball, yielding an intractable infinite-dimensional optimization problem. Upon leverage the strong duality condition, we arrive at a tractable surrogate learning problem. We develop two stochastic primal-dual algorithms to solve the resultant problem: one for epsilon-accurate convex sub-problems and another for a single gradient ascent step. We further develop a distributionally robust federated learning framework to learn robust model using heterogeneous data sets stored at distinct locations by solving per-learner's sub-problems locally, offering robustness with modest computational overhead and considering data distribution. Numerical tests corroborate merits of our training algorithms against distributional uncertainties and adversarially corrupted test data samples.

AB Standard federated learning approaches suffer when client data distributions have sufficient heterogeneity. Re-cent methods addressed the client data heterogeneity issue via personalized federated learning (PFL) - a class of FL algorithms aiming to personalize learned global knowledge to better suit the clients' local data distributions. Existing PFL methods usually decouple global updates in deep neural networks by performing personalization on particular layers (i.e. classifier heads) and global aggregation for the rest of the network. However, preselecting network layers for personalization may result in suboptimal storage of global knowledge. In this work, we propose FEDSELECT, a novel PFL algorithm inspired by the iterative subnetwork discovery procedure used for the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis. FEDSELECT incrementally expands subnetworks to personalize client parameters, concurrently conducting global aggregations on the remaining parameters. This approach enables the personalization of both client parameters and subnetwork structure during the training process. Finally, we show that FEDSELECT outperforms recent state-of-the-art PFL algorithms under challenging client data heterogeneity settings and demonstrates robustness to various real-world distributional shifts. Our code is available at https://github.com/lapisrocks/fedselect.

AB The Fermi surface symmetric mass generation (SMG) is an intrinsically interaction-driven mechanism that opens an excitation gap on the Fermi surface without invoking symmetry-breaking or topological order. We explore this phenomenon within a bilayer square lattice model of spin-1/2 fermions, where the system can be tuned from a metallic Fermi liquid phase to a strongly interacting SMG insulator phase by an interlayer spin-spin interaction. The SMG insulator preserves all symmetries and has no mean-field interpretation at the single-particle level. It is characterized by zeros in the fermion Green's function, which encapsulate the same Fermi volume in momentum space as the original Fermi surface, a feature mandated by the Luttinger theorem. Utilizing both numerical and field-theoretical methods, we provide compelling evidence for these Green's function zeros across both strong and weak coupling regimes of the SMG phase. Our findings highlight the robustness of the zero Fermi surface, which offers promising avenues for experimental identification of SMG insulators through spectroscopy experiments despite potential spectral broadening from noise or dissipation.

AB The emergence of artificial emotional intelligence technology is revolutionizing the fields of computers and robotics, allowing for a new level of communication and understanding of human behavior that was once thought impossible. While recent advancements in deep learning have transformed the field of computer vision, automated understanding of evoked or expressed emotions in visual media remains in its infancy. This foundering stems from the absence of a universally accepted definition of "emotion", coupled with the inherently subjective nature of emotions and their intricate nuances. In this article, we provide a comprehensive, multidisciplinary overview of the field of emotion analysis in visual media, drawing on insights from psychology, engineering, and the arts. We begin by exploring the psychological foundations of emotion and the computational principles that underpin the understanding of emotions from images and videos. We then review the latest research and systems within the field, accentuating the most promising approaches. We also discuss the current technological challenges and limitations of emotion analysis, underscoring the necessity for continued investigation and innovation. We contend that this represents a "Holy Grail" research problem in computing and delineate pivotal directions for future inquiry. Finally, we examine the ethical ramifications of emotion-understanding technologies and contemplate their potential societal impacts. Overall, this article endeavors to equip readers with a deeper understanding of the domain of emotion analysis in visual media and to inspire further research and development in this captivating and rapidly evolving field.

AB In this paper, we study the network linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem with system matrices being spatially-exponential decaying (SED) between nodes in a network. The main result demonstrates that the optimal controller also enjoys a similar 'quasi'-SED structure (under certain stabilizability assumptions), which enables us to further develop an upper-bound on the performance gap between optimal kappa-truncated local controllers and global optimal controllers, showing that distributed controllers can achieve near-optimal performance for SED systems. The result builds upon analyzing the structure of disturbance response control (DRC), another type of control studied in recent online control literature, and establishing an algebraic connection between DRC and the optimal feedback control, which could be viewed as contributions on their own merits. Lastly, we validate the results numerically on several examples. (c) 2024 Elsevier Ltd. All rights are reserved, including those for text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies.

AB Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have received increasing attention due to their ability to learn from graph-structured data. To open the black-box of these deep learning models, post-hoc instance-level explanation methods have been proposed to understand GNN predictions. These methods seek to discover substructures that explain the prediction behavior of a trained GNN. In this paper, we show analytically that for a large class of explanation tasks, conventional approaches, which are based on the principle of graph information bottleneck (GIB), admit trivial solutions that do not align with the notion of explainability. Instead, we argue that a modified GIB principle may be used to avoid the aforementioned trivial solutions. We further introduce a novel factorized explanation model with theoretical performance guarantees. The modified GIB is used to analyze the structural properties of the proposed factorized explainer. We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to validate the effectiveness of our proposed factorized explainer.

AB With rapid evolution of mobile core network (MCN) architectures, large-scale control-plane traffic (CPT) traces are critical to studying MCN design and performance optimization by the R&D community. The prior-art control-plane traffic generator SMM heavily relies on domain knowledge which requires re-design as the domain evolves. In this work, we study the feasibility of developing a high-fidelity MCN control plane traffic generator by leveraging generative ML models. We identify key challenges in synthesizing high-fidelity CPT including generic (to data-plane) requirements such as multi-modality feature relationships and unique requirements such as stateful semantics and long-term (time-of-day) data variations. We show state-of-the-art, generative adversarial network (GAN)-based approaches shown to work well for data-plane traffic cannot meet these fidelity requirements of CPT, and develop a transformer-based model, CPT-GPT, that accurately captures complex dependencies among the samples in each traffic stream (control events by the same UE) without the need for GAN. Our evaluation of CPT-GPT on a large-scale control-plane traffic trace shows that (1) it does not rely on domain knowledge yet synthesizes control-plane traffic with comparable fidelity as SMM; (2) compared to the prior-art GAN-based approach, it reduces the fraction of streams that violate stateful semantics by two orders of magnitude, the max y-distance of sojourn time distributions of streams by 16.0%, and the transfer learning time in deriving new hourly models by 3.36x.

AB We introduce a population-based approach to solving parameterized graph problems for which the goal is to identify a small set of vertices subject to a feasibility criterion. The idea is to evolve a population of individuals where each individual corresponds to an optimal solution to a subgraph of the original problem. The crossover operation then combines both solutions and subgraphs with the hope to generate an optimal solution for a slightly larger graph. In order to correctly combine solutions and subgraphs, we propose a new crossover operator called generalized allelic crossover which generalizes uniform crossover by associating a probability at each locus depending on the combined alleles of the parents. We prove for graphs with n vertices and m edges, the approach solves the k-vertex cover problem in expected time O(4(k)m + m(4) log n) using a simple RLS-style mutation. This bound can be improved to O(4(k)m + m(2)nk log n) by using standard mutation constrained to the vertices of the graph.

AB Bootstrap embedding (BE) is a recently developed electronic structure method that has shown great success at treating electron correlation in molecules. Here, we extend BE to treat surfaces and solids where the wave function is represented in periodic boundary conditions using reciprocal space sums (i.e., k-point sampling). The major benefit of this approach is that the resulting fragment Hamiltonians carry no explicit dependence on the reciprocal space sums, allowing one to apply traditional nonperiodic electronic structure codes to the fragments even though the entire system requires careful consideration of periodic boundary conditions. Using coupled cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) as an example method to solve the fragment Hamiltonians, we present minimal basis set CCSD-in-HF results on 1D conducting polymers. We show that periodic BE-CCSD can typically recover similar to 99.9% of the electron correlation energy. We further demonstrate that periodic BE-CCSD is feasible even for complex donor- acceptor polymers of interest to organic solar cells-despite the fact that the monomers are sufficiently large that even a Gamma-point periodic CCSD calculation is prohibitive. We conclude that BE is a promising new tool for applying molecular electronic structure tools to solids and interfaces.

ID ADVANCED PHYSICS; STUDENTS LEARN; DIFFICULTIES; ENERGY
AB We discuss an investigation of student sensemaking and reasoning in the context of degenerate perturbation theory (DPT) in quantum mechanics. We find that advanced undergraduate and graduate students in quantum physics courses often struggled with expertlike sensemaking and reasoning to solve DPT problems. The sensemaking and reasoning were particularly challenging for students as they tried to integrate physical and mathematical concepts to solve DPT problems. Their sensemaking showed local coherence but lacked global consistency with different knowledge resources getting activated in different problem-solving tasks even if the same concepts were applicable. Depending upon the issues involved in the DPT problems, students were sometimes stuck in the "physics mode" or "math mode" and found it challenging to coordinate and integrate the physics and mathematics appropriately to solve quantum mechanics problems involving DPT. Their sensemaking shows the use of various reasoning primitives. It also shows that some advanced students struggled with self-monitoring and checking their answers to make sure they were consistent across different problems. Some also relied on memorized information, invoked authority, and did not make appropriate connections between their DPT problem solutions and the outcomes of experiments. Advanced students in quantum mechanics often displayed analogous patterns of challenges in sensemaking and reasoning as those that have been found in introductory physics. Student sensemaking and reasoning show that these advanced students are still developing expertise in this novel quantum physics domain as they learn to integrate physical and mathematical concepts.

AB An inverse problem motivated by packet sampling in communication networks and edge sampling in directed complex networks is studied through the operator perspective. The problem is shown to be ill-posed, with the resulting naive estimator potentially having very heavy tails, satisfying non-Gaussian central limit theorem and showing poor statistical performance. Regularisation of the problem leads to the Gaussian central limit theorem and superior performance of the regularised estimator, as a result of desirable properties of underlying operators. The limiting variance and convergence rates of the regularised estimator are also investigated. The results are illustrated on synthetic and real data from communication and complex networks.

AB One of the core promises of parametric Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is that users can easily edit their model at any point in time. However, due to the ambiguity of changing references to intermediate, updated geometry, parametric edits can lead to reference errors which are difficult to fix in practice. We claim that debugging reference errors remains challenging because CAD systems do not provide users with tools to understand where the error happened and how to fix it. To address these challenges, we prototype a graphical debugging tool, DeCAD, which helps comparing CAD model states both across operations and across edits. In a qualitative lab study, we use DeCAD as a probe to understand specific challenges that users face and what workflows they employ to overcome them. We conclude with design implications for future debugging tool developers.

AB With faster wireless networks and server GPUs, offloading high-accuracy but compute-intensive AR tasks implemented in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to edge servers offers a promising way to support high-QoE Augmented/Mixed Reality (AR/MR) applications. A cost-effective way for AR app vendors to deploy such edge-assisted AR apps to support a large user base is to use commercial Machine-Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS) deployed at the edge cloud. To maximize cost-effectiveness, such an MLaaS provider faces a key design challenge, i.e., how to maximize the number of clients concurrently served by each GPU server in its cluster while meeting per-client AR task accuracy SLAs. The above AR offloading inference serving problem differs from generic inference serving or video analytics serving in one fundamental way: due to the use of local tracking which reuses the last server-returned inference result to derive results for the current frame, the offloading frequency and end-to-end latency of each AR client directly affect its AR task accuracy (for all the frames).
   In this paper, we present ARISE, a framework that optimizes the edge server capacity in serving edge-assisted AR clients. Our design exploits the intricate interplay between per-client offloading schedule and batched inference on the server via proactively coordinating offloading request streams from different AR clients. Our evaluation using a large set of emulated AR clients and a 10-phone testbed shows that ARISE supports 1.7x-6.9x more clients compared to various baselines while keeping the per-client accuracy within the client-specified accuracy SLAs.

The low-cost receiver is composed of a 4 - element patch array, a planar comparator network, and a down conversion module. Different from other signal processing methods, a deep neural network is developed for proposed low-cost monopulse receiver, which can map the misaligned target angular positions in the measurement to the actual physical location under detection.

DT Article
DE Continual learning; distributionally robust optimization; f-divergence;
   Wasserstein gradient flow
AB Continual learning (CL) aims to learn a non-stationary data distribution and not forget previous knowledge. The effectiveness of existing approaches that rely on memory replay can decrease over time as the model tends to overfit the stored examples. As a result, the model's ability to generalize well is significantly constrained. Additionally, these methods often overlook the inherent uncertainty in the memory data distribution, which differs significantly from the distribution of all previous data examples. To overcome these issues, we propose a principled memory evolution framework that dynamically adjusts the memory data distribution. This evolution is achieved by employing distributionally robust optimization (DRO) to make the memory buffer increasingly difficult to memorize. We consider two types of constraints in DRO: f-divergence and Wasserstein ball constraints. For f-divergence constraint, we derive a family of methods to evolve the memory buffer data in the continuous probability measure space with Wasserstein gradient flow (WGF). For Wasserstein ball constraint, we directly solve it in the euclidean space. Extensive experiments on existing benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods for alleviating forgetting. As a by-product of the proposed framework, our method is more robust to adversarial examples than compared CL methods.

AB Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) has well documented merits in enhancing generalization of deep neural networks, even without sizable data augmentation. Embracing the geometry of the loss function, where neighborhoods of 'flat minima' heighten generalization ability, SAM seeks 'flat valleys' by minimizing the maximum loss caused by an adversary perturbing parameters within the neighborhood. Although critical to account for sharpness of the loss function, such an 'over-friendly adversary' can curtail the outmost level of generalization. The novel approach of this contribution fosters stabilization of adversaries through variance suppression (VaSSO) to avoid such friendliness. VaSSO's provable stability safeguards its numerical improvement over SAM in model-agnostic tasks, including image classification and machine translation. In addition, experiments confirm that VaSSO endows SAM with robustness against high levels of label noise. Code is available at https://github.com/BingcongLi/VaSSO.

ID FEATURE LOCATION; QUERY
AB Code search is vital in the maintenance and extension of software systems. Past works have used separate language models for the natural language and programming language artifacts on models with multiple encoders and different loss functions. Similarly, this work approaches code search for Python as a translation retrieval problem while the natural language queries and the programming language are treated as two types of languages. By using dual encoders, these two types of language sequences are projected onto a shared embedding space, in which the distance reflects the similarity between a given pair of query and code. However, in contrast to previous work, this approach uses a unified language model, and a dual encoder structure with a cosine similarity loss function. A unified language model helps the model take advantage of the considerable overlap of words between the artifacts, making the learning much easier. On the other hand, the dual encoders trained with cosine similarity loss helps the model learn the underlining patterns of which terms are important for predicting linked pairs of artifacts. Evaluation shows the proposed model achieves performance better than state-of-the-art code search models. In addition, this model is much less expensive in terms of time and complexity, offering a cheaper, faster, and better alternative.

The nature and timing of transitions in markets and institutions in response to growing climate risks will shape prospects for future socioeconomic well- being. As property insurance markets in the United States face higher levels of turmoil, policymakers are weighing various interventions to stabilize not only insurance but also housing and mortgage markets. We identify policy lessons based on the investigation of three bounding scenarios designed to address the question of how near- term (1 to 3 y) policy and regulatory choices surrounding insurance markets in Florida could influence medium- term (3 to 15 y) risk levels, disaster recovery, housing markets, and local economic outcomes. Since our policy choices today have a profound impact on future outcomes, careful consideration of the longer- term impacts of today's policy choices is required to secure more effective and equitable adaptation decisions and pathways.

DE graphs; Markov chains; Weisfeiler-Lehman; optimal transport
AB (Directed) graphs with node attributes are a common type of data in various applications and there is a vast literature on developing metrics and efficient algorithms for comparing them. Recently, in the graph learning and optimization communities, a range of new approaches have been developed for comparing graphs with node attributes, leveraging ideas such as the Optimal Transport (OT) and the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) graph isomorphism test. Two state-of-the-art representatives are the OTC distance proposed in (O'Connor et al., 2022) and the WL distance in (Chen et al., 2022). Interestingly, while these two distances are developed based on different ideas, we observe that they both view graphs as Markov chains, and are deeply connected. Indeed, in this paper, we propose a unified framework to generate distances for Markov chains (thus including (directed) graphs with node attributes), which we call the Optimal Transport Markov (OTM) distances, that encompass both the OTC and the WL distances. We further introduce a special one-parameter family of distances within our OTM framework, called the discounted WL distance. We show that the discounted WL distance has nice theoretical properties and can address several limitations of the existing OTC and WL distances. Furthermore, contrary to the OTC and the WL distances, our new discounted WL distance can be differentiated after a entropy-regularization similar to the Sinkhorn distance, making it suitable to use in learning frameworks, e.g., as the reconstruction loss in a graph generative model.

AB Optimal transport provides a metric which quantifies the dissimilarity between probability measures. For measures supported in discrete metric spaces, finding the optimal transport distance has cubic time complexity in the size of the space. However, measures supported on trees admit a closed-form optimal transport that can be computed in linear time. In this paper, we aim to find an optimal tree structure for a given discrete metric space so that the tree-Wasserstein distance approximates the optimal transport distance in the original space. One of our key ideas is to cast the problem in ultrametric spaces. This helps us optimize over the space of ultrametric trees- a mixed-discrete and continuous optimization problem - via projected gradient decent over the space of ultrametric matrices. During optimization, we project the parameters to the ultrametric space via a hierarchical minimum spanning tree algorithm, equivalent to the closest projection to ultrametrics under the supremum norm. Experimental results on real datasets show that our approach outperforms previous approaches (e.g. Flowtree, Quadtree) in approximating optimal transport distances. Finally, experiments on synthetic data generated on ground truth trees show that our algorithm can accurately uncover the underlying trees.

AB With the continuous evolution of attack methods, cyber attacks have become more distributed and complex, employing techniques such as multi-stage network attacks (MSA). Monitoring tools generate numerous alerts during these attacks, but the high dimensionality and diverse features of alert data often result in poor detection performance. Manual analysis of MSAs is time-consuming, leading to limited labeled data. Additionally, changes in attack types and new domains cause Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) to perform poorly, presenting a significant challenge known as domain shift. In this paper, we address these issues by proposing a multi -stage network attack detection algorithm that enhances MSA detection through the analysis of high -dimensional alerts and the integration of various alert aspects. Our algorithm incorporates multiple facets including semantic similarity, anomaly scores, and feature extraction to identify relevant entities, detect intricate relationships, and uncover hidden patterns, enhancing the detection of multi -stage network attacks. The model was tested successfully using the DARPA 2000 and ISCX 2012 datasets, with completeness and soundness measured to evaluate its effectiveness.

AB The rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) has opened up exciting possibilities for new applications. One such novel application is the modernization of maritime communications. Effective maritime communication is vital for ensuring the safety of crew members, vessels, and cargo. The maritime industry is responsible for the transportation of a significant portion of global trade, and as such, the efficient and secure transfer of information is essential to maintain the flow of goods and services. With the increasing complexity of maritime operations, technological advancements such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), and the Internet of Ships (IoS) have been introduced to enhance communication and operational efficiency. However, these technologies also bring new challenges in terms of security and network management. Compromised IT systems, with escalated privileges, can potentially enable easy and ready access to operational technology (OT) systems and networks with the same privileges, with an increased risk of zero-day attacks. In this paper, we first provide a review of the current state and modalities of maritime communications. We then review the current adoption of software-defined radios (SDRs) and software-defined networks (SDNs) in the maritime industry and evaluate their impact as maritime IoT enablers. Finally, as a key contribution of this paper, we propose a unified SDN-SDR-driven cross-layer communications framework that leverages the existing SATCOM communications infrastructure, for improved and resilient maritime communications in highly dynamic and resource-constrained environments.

AB Background:Early surgical exposure and research fellowships can influence medical students' specialty choice, increase academic productivity, and impact residency match. However, to our knowledge, there is no published guidance on the programmatic evaluation and quality enhancement necessary for the sustainability of formal plastic surgery summer research programs for first year medical students. We present seven years (2013-2020) of institutional experience in an effort to inform program development at other institutions. Methods:From 2013 to 2016, a sole basic science research arm existed. In 2017, a clinical research arm was introduced, with several supplemental activities, including surgical skills curriculum. A formalized selection process was instituted in 2014. Participant feedback was analyzed annually. Long-term outcomes included continued research commitment, productivity, and residency match. Results:The applicant pool reached 96 applicants in 2019, with 85% from outside institutions. Acceptance rate reached 7% in 2020. With adherence to a scoring rubric for applicant evaluation, good to excellent interrater reliability was achieved (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.75). Long-term outcomes showed that on average per year, 28% of participants continued involvement in departmental research and 29% returned for dedicated research. Upon finishing medical school, participants had a mean of 7 +/- 4 peer-reviewed publications. In total, 62% of participants matched into a surgical residency program, with 54% in integrated plastic surgery. Conclusions:A research program designed for first year medical students interested in plastic surgery can achieve academic goals. Students are provided with mentorship, networking opportunities, and tools for self-guided learning and career development.

ID STRUCTURED LIGHT; VISION; STEREO
AB Recovering 3D geometry of underwater scenes is challenging because of the non-linear refraction of light at the water-air interface, which is caused by the camera housing. We present a light field-based approach that leverages properties of angular samples for high-quality underwater 3D reconstruction from a single viewpoint. Specifically, we re-sample the light field image to angular patches. As underwater scenes exhibit weak view-dependent specularity, an angular patch tends to have uniform intensity when sampled at the correct depth. We thus impose this angular uniformity as a constraint for depth estimation. For efficient angular re-sampling, we design a fast approximation algorithm based on multivariate polynomial regression to approximate nonlinear refraction paths. We further develop a light field calibration algorithm that estimates the water-air interface geometry along with the camera parameters. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real data show our method produces state-of-the-art reconstruction of static and dynamic underwater scenes.

AB A comprehensive patient health history is essential for patient care and healthcare research. However, due to the distributed nature of healthcare services, patient health records are often scattered across multiple systems. Existing record linkage approaches primarily rely on patient identifiers, which have inherent limitations such as privacy invasion and identifier discrepancies. To tackle this problem, we propose linking de-identified patient health records by matching health patterns without strictly relying on sensitive patient identifiers. Our model MedLink solves two challenges faced with the patient linkage task: (1) the challenge of identifying the same patients based on data collected in different timelines as disease progression makes the record matching difficult, and (2) the challenge of identifying distinct health patterns as common medical codes dominate health records and overshadow the more informative low-prevalence codes. To address these challenges, MedLink utilizes bi-directional health prediction to predict future codes forwardly and past codes backwardly, thus accounting for the health progression. MedLink also has a prevalence-aware retrieval design to focus more on the low-prevalence but informative codes during learning. MedLink can be trained end-to-end and is lightweight for efficient inference on large patient databases. We evaluate MedLink against leading baselines on real-world patient datasets, including the critical care dataset MIMIC-III and a large health claims dataset. Results show that MedLink outperforms the best baseline by 4% in top-1 accuracy with only 8% memory cost. Additionally, when combined with existing identifier-based linkage approaches, MedLink can improve their performance by up to 15%.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB Recent years have witnessed the emergence of mobile edge computing (MEC), on the premise of a cost-effective enhancement in the computational ability of hardware-constrained wireless devices (WDs) comprising the Internet of Things (IoT). In a general multi-server multi-user MEC system, each WD has a computational task to execute and has to select binary (off)loading decisions, along with the analog-amplitude resource allocation variables in an online manner, with the goal of minimizing the overall energy-delay cost (EDC) with dynamic system states. While past works typically rely on the explicit expression of the EDC function, the present contribution considers a practical setting, where in lieu of system state information, the EDC function is not available in analytical form, and instead only the function values at queried points are revealed. Towards tackling such a challenging online combinatorial problem with only bandit information, novel Bayesian optimization (BO) based approach is put forth by leveraging the multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework. Per time slot, by exploiting temporal information, the discrete offloading decisions are first obtained via the MAB method, and the analog resource allocation variables are subsequently optimized using the BO selection rule. Numerical tests validate the effectiveness of the proposed BO approach.

AB Mobile Crowdsensing (MCS) represents a transformative approach to collecting data from the environment as it utilizes the ubiquity and sensory capabilities of mobile devices with human participants. This paradigm enables scales of data collection critical for applications ranging from environmental monitoring to urban planning. However, the effective harnessing of this distributed data collection capability faces significant challenges. One of the most significant challenges is the variability in the sensing qualities of the participating devices while they are initially unknown and must be learned over time to optimize task assignments. This paper tackles the dual challenges of managing task diversity to mitigate data redundancy and optimizing task assignment amidst the inherent variability of worker performance. We introduce a novel model that dynamically adjusts task weights based on assignment frequency to promote diversity and incorporates a flexible approach to account for the different qualities of task completion, especially in scenarios with overlapping task assignments. Our strategy aims to maximize the overall weighted quality of data collected within the constraints of a predefined budget. Our strategy leverages a combinatorial multi-armed bandit framework with an upper confidence bound approach to guide decision-making. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through a combination of regret analysis and simulations grounded in realistic scenarios.

TI RealFill: Reference-Driven Generation for Authentic Image Completion
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON GRAPHICS

DT Article
DE Image Completion; Diffusion Model
AB Recent advances in generative imagery have brought forth outpainting and inpainting models that can produce high-quality, plausible image content in unknown regions. However, the content these models hallucinate is necessarily inauthentic, since they are unaware of the true scene. In this work, we propose RealFill, a novel generative approach for image completion that fills in missing regions of an image with the content that should have been there. RealFill is a generative inpainting model that is personalized using only a few reference images of a scene. These reference images do not have to be aligned with the target image, and can be taken with drastically varying viewpoints, lighting conditions, camera apertures, or image styles. Once personalized, RealFill is able to complete a target image with visually compelling contents that are faithful to the original scene. We evaluate RealFill on a new image completion benchmark that covers a set of diverse and challenging scenarios, and find that it outperforms existing approaches by a large margin.

ID BATTERY-FREE; DESIGN
AB This paper introduces INTOS, an embedded operating system and language support for multi-threaded intermittent computing on a battery-less energy-harvesting platform. INTOS simplifies programming with a traditional "thread" and a "transaction" with automatic undo-logging of persistent objects in non-volatile memory. While INTOS allows the use of volatile memory for performance and energy efficiency, conventional transactions do not ensure crash consistency of volatile register and memory states. To address this challenge, INTOS proposes a novel replay-and-bypass approach, eliminating the need for users to checkpoint volatile states. Upon power restoration, INTOS recovers non-volatile states by undoing the updates of power-interrupted transactions. To reconstruct volatile states, INTOS restarts each thread bypassing committed transactions and system calls by returning recorded results without re-execution. INTOS seeks to build a persistent, full-fledged embedded OS, supporting priority-based preemptive multithreading while ensuring crash consistency even if power failure occurs during a system call or while some threads are blocked. Experiments on a commodity platform MSP430FR5994 show that when subjected to an extreme power failure frequency of 1 ms, INTOS demonstrated 1.24x lower latency and 1.29x less energy consumption than prior work leveraging idempotent processing. This trend turns out to be more pronounced on Apollo 4 Blue Plus.

AB Recent research in deterministic sensor placement optimization technologies has improved the capability of monitoring large-scale field environments with a limited budget. In traditional stochastic mixed-integer linear programming formulations, minimizing the expectation of detection time can lead to a detector placement with good average behavior but unexpected worst case behavior. The uncertainty factors in the complex environment and sensor system significantly challenge the effects of the placement strategy provided by stochastic programming (SP). These factors include unknown leakage rate and location, sensor delay, and primary uncertainty of wind conditions. This article introduces a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) formulation of sensor placement under the uncertainty of wind conditions and improves a sensor network's detection robustness. The method is demonstrated using the atmospheric simulation with site-specific methane-emission scenarios that capture partial natural wind conditions and emission characteristics. DRO techniques are employed to determine sensor locations that minimize the detection time expectation of the emission scenarios with a significantly better worst case behavior. Experiment results show that the proposed DRO method outperforms the sensor placement methods based on SP.

DE Defender-attacker games; (in)complete information; (im)perfect
   information; repeated games; sequential games
AB Cyber-security research often focuses on attack-defense games where a strategic attacker seeks to destroy the defender's targets or kill him. In such a game there is a defender who just try to protect himself. In the real world, players can choose to protect themselves as well as kill their opponents to maximize their overall gain. In this case, the player allocates their budget for both defending and attacking actions and decides how well to attack and how well to defend against others. Players should allocate their budgets appropriately for each action throughout multiple rounds when playing such a game. The probabilities of surviving and killing in each round are determined by what happened in the previous rounds and the amount of the remaining budget. Players can continue playing until they die or run out of money. It is possible for the player not to be aware of everything his opponent does. Despite knowing that his opponent is playing according to one of the possible types, he cannot see which action exactly he is taking. Likewise, it may be the case that the player only sees the opponent's action, but does not know what its objective is. To meet this challenge, this paper develops a game where players decide how to allocate resources when they have partial information. For a model with complete information, equilibrium can be found and, as an extension, models with incomplete and imperfect information are also discussed. Our simulation examines how utility changes based on prior beliefs, total budgets, costs, and uncertainty.

AB We present an exceptional point (EP)-based temporally modulated wireless passive sensor, surpassing partly the shortcomings of traditional sensor structures, such as energy-consuming, low sensitivity, and hard-to-integrate. For traditional sensors, those factors mentioned above restrict the scope of applications. To address these limitations, temporally modulated EPs are introduced into LC tank sensing topologies. Originating from quantum mechanics, EPs are characterized by the coalescence of a system's complex eigenvalues, leading to considerable frequency splitting in response to minor perturbations. In this letter, comprehensive simulation results validate the feasibility and enhanced performance of this approach, confirming its superiority over existing sensor technologies. The introduction of EP-based wireless sensors equipped with time modulation marks a significant advancement in the field, promising substantial improvements in the sensitivity and accuracy of wireless sensors for a variety of applications.

AB Although coming down with an illness or receiving a vaccine are both common experiences, the influence of such acute immune system activations on cognitive processes, such as inhibitory control, has received relatively little attention. We addressed that issue by assessing the effects of acute immune system activation on inhibitory control in a randomized controlled experiment, and by conducting a meta-analysis of similar studies in humans. In our experiment, we found-somewhat surprisingly-that influenza vaccination improved performance on both of our inhibitory control outcomes (i.e., stop-signal reaction times and flanker interference effects). At the meta-analytic level, we found that at a short delay (1.5-4 hours post-injection) between immune activation and inhibitory control assessment, such activation impaired multiple forms of inhibitory control, whereas after a longer delay (e.g., > 18 hours post-injection), such activation improved inhibitory control-consistent with our experiment. Moreover, proinflammatory cytokine activity predicted poorer interference control but better response inhibition, even with a long delay between injection and testing. Together, these results highlight nuanced, time-dependent, and-perhaps-multiple-mechanism-driven effects of acute immune system activity on inhibitory control.

AB Electromagnetic transients are a challenge to manage in power systems. Among these concerns are switching overvoltages, which require meticulous attention from power system designers. Evaluating this transient phenomenon becomes imperative when expanding the grid with new installations. This paper delves into the switching overvoltage (SOV) analysis, focusing on a novel proposed unconventional line. A comprehensive comparison with an existing conventional line is conducted utilizing various line models in EMTP-RV. Our investigation explores the nuanced behaviors revealed by frequency-dependent (FD) and wide-band (WB) models, shedding light on distinctive transient responses. The paper will examine the waveform characteristics using a straightforward and computationally efficient example.

AB Question-answering based text summarization can produce personalized and specific summaries; however, the primary challenge is the generation and selection of questions that users expect the summary to answer. Large language models (LLMs) provide an automatic method for generating these questions from the original text. By prompting the LLM to answer these selected questions based on the original text, high-quality summaries can be produced. In this paper, we experiment with an approach for question generation, selection, and text summarization using the LLM tool GPT4o. We also conduct a comparative study of existing summarization approaches and evaluation metrics to understand how to produce personalized and useful summaries. Based on the experiment results, we explain why question-answering based text summarization achieves better performance.

AB This paper explores secret key generation in 5G and beyond LiFi networks using visible light in the downlink and infrared in the uplink. Unlike the existing works, we focus on a realistic indoor environment with multi-user mobility. Given inaccuracies in high-frequency channel models, we introduce the first deep learning model that combines the channel probing and quantization phases to generate initial secret keys with a minimal key disagreement rate (KDR) of 16% between the uplink and downlink, leading to a key generation rate (KGR) of 79 bits/s after information reconciliation. We show that LiFi channel statistics suffer from concept drifts with user density changes in the room. This increases the KDR by 28% - 44% and the generated keys fail to pass the NIST randomness tests. As a countermeasure, we introduce a voting ensemble model that mitigates concept drifts, maintaining a stable 16% KDR, 79 bits/s KGR, and passing NIST tests, despite the varying user densities.

AB Meta-learning owns unique effectiveness and swiftness in tackling emerging tasks with limited data. Its broad applicability is revealed by viewing it as a bi-level optimization problem. The resultant algorithmic viewpoint however, faces scalability issues when the inner-level optimization relies on gradient-based iterations. Implicit differentiation has been considered to alleviate this challenge, but it is restricted to an isotropic Gaussian prior, and only favors deterministic metalearning approaches. This work markedly mitigates the scalability bottleneck by cross-fertilizing the benefits of implicit differentiation to probabilistic Bayesian meta-learning. The novel implicit Bayesian meta-learning (iBaML) method not only broadens the scope of learnable priors, but also quantifies the associated uncertainty. Furthermore, the ultimate complexity is well controlled regardless of the inner-level optimization trajectory. Analytical error bounds are established to demonstrate the precision and efficiency of the generalized implicit gradient over the explicit one. Extensive numerical tests are also carried out to empirically validate the performance of the proposed method.

AB Major cities worldwide are increasingly experiencing intense heatwaves, which disproportionately affect vulnerable populations. This suggests the urgent need for focused attention and mitigation strategies to protect those most at risk from the impacts of heatwaves. The presence of vulnerable groups in buildings with varying thermal conditions can result in different outcomes during extreme heat events, making it crucial to evaluate the thermal resilience of buildings in conjunction with social vulnerability. This research advances the understanding of thermal vulnerability by integrating building thermal characteristics with social vulnerability. While previous studies have predominantly focused on socio-ethnic and economic dimensions of vulnerability, this study specifically investigates the relationship between social vulnerability and thermal resilience, with a focus on building thermal parameters. Datasets from Zillow and ResStock are used to capture the thermal properties of buildings, while social vulnerability data is obtained from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. A Gaussian Na & iuml;ve Bayes (GNB) model is applied to enhance building envelope attributes from Zillow, leveraging detailed information from ResStock data. Additionally, a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test is conducted to analyze diverse thermal attributes, such as age of buildings, room size, number of stories, building area, envelope characteristics, systems, infiltration, across differing levels of social vulnerability (high and low). Specifically, Philadelphia is selected as the analysis focus. The analysis reveals significant associations between thermal resilience and social vulnerability. Groups with higher social vulnerability are more likely to be exposed to elevated levels of thermal vulnerability compared to less vulnerable groups. This highlights the necessity for tailored interventions aimed at promoting the development of more resilient and equitable buildings, capable of reducing the impacts of heatwaves on vulnerable communities.

ID PROCESSOR PERFORMANCE; DESIGN SPACE; ACCURATE
AB Microarchitecture simulators are indispensable tools for microarchitecture designers to validate, estimate, optimize, and manufacture new hardware that meets specific design requirements. While the quest for a fast, accurate and detailed microarchitecture simulation has been ongoing for decades, existing simulators excel and fall short at different aspects: (i) Although execution-driven simulation is accurate and detailed, it is extremely slow and requires expert-level experience to design. (ii) Trace-driven simulation reuses the execution traces in pursuit of fast simulation but faces accuracy concerns and fails to achieve significant speedup. (iii) Emerging deep learning (DL)-based simulations are remarkably fast and have acceptable accuracy, but fail to provide adequate low-level microarchitectural performance metrics such as branch mispredictions or cache misses, which is crucial for microarchitectural bottleneck analysis. Additionally, they introduce substantial overheads from trace regeneration and model re-training when simulating a new microarchitecture.
   Re-thinking the advantages and limitations of the aforementioned three mainstream simulation paradigms, this paper introduces Tao that redesigns the DL-based simulation with three primary contributions: First, we propose a new training dataset design such that the subsequent simulation (i.e., inference) only needs functional trace as inputs, which can be rapidly generated and reused across microarchitectures. Second, to increase the detail of the simulation, we redesign the input features and the DL model using self-attention to support predicting various performance metrics of interest. Third, we propose techniques to train a microarchitecture agnostic embedding layer that enables fast transfer learning between different microarchitectural configurations and effectively reduces the re-training overhead of conventional DL-based simulators. Tao can predict various performance metrics of interest, significantly reduce the simulation time, and maintain similar simulation accuracy as state-of-the-art DL-based endeavors. Our extensive evaluation shows Tao can reduce the overall training and simulation time by 18.06x over the state-of-the-art DL-based endeavors.

AB Graph Laplacian learning, also known as network topology inference, is a problem of great interest to multiple communities. In Gaussian graphical models (GM), graph learning amounts to endowing covariance selection with the Laplacian structure. In graph signal processing (GSP), it is essential to infer the unobserved graph from the outputs of a filtering system. In this paper, we study the problem of learning Cartesian product graphs under Laplacian constraints. The Cartesian graph product is a natural way for modeling higher-order conditional dependencies and is also the key for generalizing GSP to multiway tensors. We establish statistical consistency for the penalized maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of a Cartesian product Laplacian, and propose an efficient algorithm to solve the problem. We also extend our method for efficient joint graph learning and imputation in the presence of structural missing values. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method is superior to previous GSP and GM methods.

AB Particle Imaging Velocimetry (PIV) is a classical method that estimates fluid flow by analyzing the motion of injected particles. To reconstruct and track the swirling particles is a difficult computer vision problem, as the particles are dense in the fluid volume and have similar appearances. Further, tracking a large number of particles is particularly challenging due to heavy occlusion. Here we present a low-cost PIV solution that uses compact lenslet-based light field cameras as imaging device. We develop novel optimization algorithms for dense particle 3D reconstruction and tracking. As a single light field camera has limited capacity in resolving depth (z-dimension measurement), the resolution of 3D reconstruction on the x-y plane is much higher than along the z-axis. To compensate for the imbalanced resolution in 3D, we use two light field cameras positioned at an orthogonal angle to capture particle images. In this way, we can achieve high-resolution 3D particle reconstruction in the full fluid volume. For each time frame, we first estimate particle depths under a single viewpoint by exploiting the focal stack symmetry of light field. We then fuse the recovered 3D particles in two views by solving a linear assignment problem (LAP). Specifically, we propose an anisotropic point-to-ray distance as matching cost to handle the resolution mismatch. Finally, given a sequence of 3D particle reconstructions over time, we recover the full-volume 3D fluid flow with a physically-constrained optical flow, which enforces local motion rigidity and fluid incompressibility. We perform comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real data for ablation and evaluation. We show that our method recovers full-volume 3D fluid flows of various types. Two-view reconstruction results achieves higher accuracy than those with one view only.

AB Sequential algorithms for the Stable Matching Problem are often too slow in the context of some large scale applications like switch scheduling. Parallel architectures can offer a notable reduction in complexity. We propose a stable matching algorithm using n(2) processors that converges in O(nlog(n)) average runtime. The algorithm is structurally based on the Parallel Iterative Improvement (PII) Algorithm [3], which successfully finds a stable matching in approximately 90% of cases. We suggest an alternative selection method for pairs in the PII algorithm, called Dynamic Selection, leading to an algorithm that fully converges over 200,000 trials and generally converges much faster. We also suggest the Right-Minimum selection method, leading to an algorithm which converges in approximately 99.9% of cases and can be combined with the PII-SC algorithm's cycle detection and Gale-Shapley Initiation to remove all cycles observed thus far.

ID SOFTWARE-DEFINED NETWORKS
AB The software-defined network (SDN) allows us to control network flows easily and dynamically. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are among the controller's applications. The IDS can become overloaded when analyzing a large amount of traffic. Multiple instances of IDSs are recommended across a network to increase processing power. SDN centralized control facilitates the deployment of multiple IDSs on the data plane. This paper proposes a method to deploy some IDS chains, helping the controller increase the detection rate. By grouping flows in a balanced manner and assigning each group to one IDS chain, transmission delay can be reduced. In this study, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the cost of grouping flows using a modified version of K-means and assigning an IDS chain. We implement our method on a test bed and a trace-based simulation. In various traffic scenarios, our proposed method can satisfy different measurements, such as detection rate and dropping rate, and only increases the delay by a small amount over one IDS scheme.

ID MODEL
AB Headway, namely the distance between vehicles, is a key design factor for ensuring the safe operation of autonomous driving systems. There have been studies on headway optimization based on the speeds of leading and trailing vehicles, assuming perfect sensing capabilities. In practical scenarios, however, sensing errors are inevitable, calling for a more robust headway design to mitigate the risk of collision. Undoubtedly, augmenting the safety distance would reduce traffic throughput, thus highlighting the need for headway design to incorporate both sensing errors and risk tolerance models. In addition, prioritizing group safety over individual safety is often deemed unacceptable because no driver should sacrifice their safety for the safety of others. In this study, we propose a multi-objective optimization framework that examines the impact of sensing errors on both traffic throughput and the fairness of safety among vehicles. The proposed framework provides a solution to determine the Pareto frontier for traffic throughput and vehicle safety. ComDrive, a communication-based autonomous driving simulation platform, is developed to validate the proposed approach. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing baselines.

   server framework
AB The rapid growth of data and parameter sizes of machine learning models makes it necessary to improve the efficiency of distributed training. It is observed that the communication cost usually is the bottleneck of distributed training systems. In this paper, we focus on the parameter server framework which is a widely deployed distributed learning framework. The frequent parameter pull, push, and synchronization among multiple machines leads to a huge communication volume. We aim to reduce the communication cost for the parameter server framework. Compressing the training model and optimizing the data and parameter allocation are two existing approaches to reducing communication costs. We jointly consider these two approaches and propose to optimize the data and parameter allocation after compression. Different from previous allocation schemes, the data sparsity property may no longer hold after compression. It brings additional opportunities and challenges for the allocation problem. We also consider the allocation problem for both linear and deep neural network (DNN) models. Fixed and dynamic partition algorithms are proposed accordingly. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our joint compression and partition scheme can efficiently reduce communication overhead for linear and DNN models.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The majority problem can be stated as follows: there is a collection of n bank cards that belong to different bank accounts. The only way to "read" these cards is through one or more two-input "equivalence testers". Each tester accepts two cards and outputs "yes" if two input cards correspond to the same bank account or "no" if they do not. The objective of the majority problem is to design a solution that uses the minimum number of tests to determine if more than n/2 cards belong to the same bank account and then find these cards. We first review two sequential solutions, including the Boyer-Moore optimal linear solution (i.e., with a time complexity of O(n)). Then, we introduce an optimal elimination solution together with a special structure to support a cost-optimal parallel solution that solves the problem in O(log n) using O(n/ log n) processors (i.e., testers). That is, this solution matches the optimal sequential solution with O(n) operations.

AB In linear distance metric learning, we are given data in one Euclidean metric space and the goal is to find an appropriate linear map to another Euclidean metric space which respects certain distance conditions as much as possible. In this paper, we formalize a simple and elegant method which reduces to a general continuous convex loss optimization problem, and for different noise models we derive the corresponding loss functions. We show that even if the data is noisy, the ground truth linear metric can be learned with any precision provided access to enough samples, and we provide a corresponding sample complexity bound. Moreover, we present an effective way to truncate the learned model to a low-rank model that can provably maintain the accuracy in the loss function and in parameters - the first such results of this type. Several experimental observations on synthetic and real data sets support and inform our theoretical results.

AB Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown remarkable success in modeling complex data distributions for image-to-image translation. Still, their high computational demands prohibit their deployment in practical scenarios like edge devices. Existing GAN compression methods mainly rely on knowledge distillation or convolutional classifiers' pruning techniques. Thus, they neglect the critical characteristic of GANs: their local density structure over their learned manifold. Accordingly, we approach GAN compression from a new perspective by explicitly encouraging the pruned model to preserve the density structure of the original parameterheavy model on its learned manifold. We facilitate this objective for the pruned model by partitioning the learned mani-fold of the original generator into local neighborhoods around its generated samples. Then, we propose a novel pruning objective to regularize the pruned model to preserve the local density structure over each neighborhood, resembling the kernel density estimation method. Also, we develop a collaborative pruning scheme in which the discriminator and generator are pruned by two pruning agents. We design the agents to capture interactions between the generator and discriminator by exchanging their peer's feedback when determining corresponding models' architectures. Thanks to such a design, our pruning method can efficiently find performant sub-networks and can maintain the balance between the generator and discriminator more effectively compared to baselines during pruning, thereby showing more stable pruning dynamics. Our experiments on image translation GAN models, Pix2Pix and CycleGAN, with various benchmark datasets and architectures demonstrate our method's effectiveness.

AB Among existing schemes for soft error resilience, acoustic-sensor-based detection stands out owing to its ability to prevent silent data corruption at low hardware cost. However, the state-of-the-art work not only incurs a considerable run-time overhead but also complicates the processor pipeline with intrusive micro-architectural modifications, hindering its practical deployment in real silicon. To this end, this paper presents VeriPipe, a near-zero-cost compiler/architecture codesign scheme for soft error resilience. VeriPipe compiler partitions input program to a series of regions (epochs) statically, while VeriPipe hardware verifies if they are error-free dynamically. In particular, VeriPipe achieves a simple yet efficient region-level verification where each region goes through a three-stage (Execute, Verify, and Commit) verification pipeline to ensure the absence of soft errors before proceeding to the next region. In particular, VeriPipe hardware overlaps the Verify stage of each region with the Execute stage of the next region, thereby effectively hiding the Verify delay. Experiments with 43 applications from SPEC2006/2017/NPB-CPP/SPLASH3/DoE Mini-Apps highlight the negligible overheads of VeriPipe, i.e., an average of 1% run-time overhead and a storage overhead of only 3 registers and 1 countdown timer.

AB Parametric CAD models encode entire families of shapes that should, in principle, be easy for designers to explore. However, in practice, parametric CAD models can be difficult to manipulate due to implicit semantic constraints among parameter values. Finding and enforcing these semantic constraints solely from geometry or programmatic shape representations is not possible because these constraints ultimately reflect design intent. They are informed by the designer's experience and semantics in the real world. To address this challenge, we introduce Reparam CAD, a zero-shot pipeline that leverages pre-trained large language and image model to infer meaningful space of variations for a shapeWe then re-parameterize a new constrained parametric CAD program that captures these variations, enabling effortless exploration of the design space along meaningful design axes. We evaluated our approach through five examples and a user study. The result showed that the inferred spaces are meaningful and comparable to those defined by experts. Code and data are at: https://github.com/milmillin/ReparamCAD.

AB Sizes of data processing jobs in cloud clusters have been growing rapidly in the big data era. It is critical to execute those jobs efficiently. The average job completion time (JCT) is a widely used metric to measure executing efficiency. JCT refers to the length of the time interval between a job's arrival to its completion. Typically, a data processing job contains multiple stages with complex precedence constraints. Carefully scheduling the processing sequence of stages within a job may significantly reduce its JCT. Our objective is to minimize the average JCT for online arrival jobs. The computation graphs of those jobs are usually directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). It makes the scheduling problem challenging. Recent works have shown that reinforcement learning (RL) agents can adaptively adjust the scheduling policies by dynamically assigning priorities for job stages. However, we notice that other factors besides stage priories may impact the JCT significantly. In particular, we observe that inserting idle slots before large jobs may reduce the waiting time of small jobs that arrive slightly later and reduce the average JCT. We analyze the benefits of inserting idle time for simple cases theoretically and show the condition in which idle slots should be inserted for two adjacent jobs. In addition, we adapt the RL-based scheduler by integrating the observation. Experiment results on both real-world and synthetic datasets show the efficiency of our scheduler. Also, a perturbation-based method is applied to demonstrate the contribution of each proposed feature.

AB Fairness Artificial Intelligence (AI) aims to identify and mitigate bias throughout the AI development process, spanning data collection, modeling, assessment, and deployment-a critical facet of establishing trustworthy AI systems. Tackling data bias through techniques like reweighting samples proves effective for promoting fairness. This paper undertakes a systematic exploration of reweighting samples for conventional Machine-Learning (ML) models, utilizing five models for binary classification on datasets such as Adult Income and COMPAS, incorporating various protected attributes. In particular, AI Fairness 360 (AIF360) from IBM, a versatile open-source library aimed at identifying and mitigating bias in machine-learning models throughout the entire AI application lifecycle, is employed as the foundation for conducting this systematic exploration. The evaluation of prediction outcomes employs five fairness metrics from AIF360, elucidating the nuanced and model-specific efficacy of reweighting samples in fostering fairness within traditional ML frameworks. Experimental results illustrate that reweighting samples effectively reduces bias in traditional ML methods for classification tasks. For instance, after reweighting samples, the balanced accuracy of Decision Tree (DT) improves to 100%, and its bias, as measured by fairness metrics such as Average Odds Difference (AOD), Equal Opportunity Difference (EOD), and Theil Index (TI), is mitigated to 0. However, reweighting samples does not effectively enhance the fairness performance of K Nearest Neighbor (KNN). This sheds light on the intricate dynamics of bias, underscoring the complexity involved in achieving fairness across different models and scenarios.

AB While GPUs are responsible for training the vast majority of state-of-the-art deep learning models, the implications of their architecture are often overlooked when designing new deep learning (DL) models. As a consequence, modifying a DL model to be more amenable to the target hardware can significantly improve the runtime performance of DL training and inference. In this paper, we provide a set of guidelines for users to maximize the runtime performance of their transformer models. These guidelines have been created by carefully considering the impact of various model hyperparameters controlling model shape on the efficiency of the underlying computation kernels executed on the GPU. We find the throughput of models with "efficient" model shapes is up to 39% higher while preserving accuracy compared to models with a similar number of parameters but with unoptimized shapes.

AB Recent mobile applications (i.e., apps) have been extensively implanted with paid advertisements that promote other mobile apps, including malware that raises alarming concerns in cybersecurity. Excavating the app promotion patterns in the app-promoting ecosystem allows for early interceptions of malware installment, and hence has gained more attention in recent research. However, related data in the app-promoting ecosystem such as app developers and categories is often scarce, especially when the data is collected from a single data source. The scarce data is insufficient in training effective deep and complex models for app promotion pattern mining, and targeting the data scarcity problem is therefore the key to advancing research in app promotion pattern mining. Therefore, we aim to complete data in the app-promoting ecosystem to pave the way for app-promoting pattern mining. We present SymPrompt, a language model-based framework that leverages the symbolic prompts to complete the missing data in the app-promoting ecosystem. The symbolic prompts are tokens that provide extra contextual information that assists the model in completing the missing data. We devise two sets of symbolic prompts containing contextual information from the perspectives of data structure and data semantics to assist the model prediction. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate SymPrompt's effectiveness in completing the missing in the app-promoting ecosystem. Code: https://github.com/zyouyang/SymPrompt

AB Neural sequence models based on the transformer architecture have demonstrated remarkable in-context learning (ICL) abilities, where they can perform new tasks when prompted with training and test examples, without any parameter update to the model. This work first provides a comprehensive statistical theory for transformers to perform ICL. Concretely, we show that transformers can implement a broad class of standard machine learning algorithms in context, such as least squares, ridge regression, Lasso, learning generalized linear models, and gradient descent on two-layer neural networks, with near-optimal predictive power on various in-context data distributions. Using an efficient implementation of in-context gradient descent as the underlying mechanism, our transformer constructions admit mild size bounds, and can be learned with polynomially many pretraining sequences.
   Building on these "base" ICL algorithms, intriguingly, we show that transformers can implement more complex ICL procedures involving in-context algorithm selection, akin to what a statistician can do in real life-A single transformer can adaptively select different base ICL algorithms-or even perform qualitatively different tasks-on different input sequences, without any explicit prompting of the right algorithm or task. We both establish this in theory by explicit constructions, and also observe this phenomenon experimentally. In theory, we construct two general mechanisms for algorithm selection with concrete examples: pre-ICL testing, and post-ICL validation. As an example, we use the post-ICL validation mechanism to construct a transformer that can perform nearly Bayes-optimal ICL on a challenging task-noisy linear models with mixed noise levels. Experimentally, we demonstrate the strong in-context algorithm selection capabilities of standard transformer architectures.

TI Search for core collapse supernovae signals in LIGO's third observation
   run using a network of gravitational wave detectors integrated with a
   multiclass convolutional neural network
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
LA English
DT Article
ID TO-NOISE RATIO; MODELS
AB In the existing body of literature, numerous waveforms of core collapse supernovae (CCSN) have emerged from extensive simulations conducted in high-performance computing facilities globally. These waveforms exhibit distinct characteristics related to their explosion mechanisms, influenced by parameters such as progenitor mass, angular momentum, gravitational wave energy, peak frequency, duration, and equation of state. Core collapse supernovae stand out as highly anticipated sources in LIGO's fourth observation (O4) run, prompting dedicated efforts to detect them. The integration of machine learning, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNN), has become a pivotal avenue for analysis. This study addresses a fundamental query: how can a CNN be comprehensively trained to capture all potential CCSN signatures, optimizing accuracy? The investigation presents a multivariate classification of the entire supernova waveform landscape to strategically select training waveforms that maximize the feature space. Rigorously tested on both known and unknown waveforms, the method achieves a classification accuracy of >= 90%. This approach has been seamlessly incorporated into the multilayer signal enhancement with coherent wave burst and CNN (MuLaSEcC) analysis pipeline, showcasing promising outcomes using LIGO O3b data. Noteworthy improvements include a reduction in background by >= 99%, along with the calculation of detection efficiencies for ten contemporary explosion models. The paper evaluates the search pipeline's performance by illustrating detection probability as a function of false alarm rate and false alarm probability. The results highlight a >= 50% detection efficiency within an SNR range of 20-35 for the ten analyzed models, whether trained or untrained. Time-frequency images of CCSN signals detected by the pipeline show broadband features of the CCSN waveforms that are predicted in the simulations.

AB In four-dimensional asymptotically flat spacetimes, an infinite tower of soft graviton modes is known to generate the symmetry algebra of w(1+infinity) at tree-level. Here we demonstrate that the symmetry action follows from soft graviton theorems and acts non-trivially on massive scalar particles. By generalizing previous analyses that were specifically tailored to the scattering of massless particles, our results clarify that w(1+infinity) symmetry is a universal feature of tree-level gravitational scattering in four-dimensional asymptotically flat spacetimes and originates from minimally-coupled gravitational interactions. In addition, we show that the w(1+infinity) symmetry acts non-diagonally on massive states by mixing an infinite number of conformal families. We also present a concrete example of non-local behavior on the celestial sphere in the presence of massive scattering states.

AB In the past few years, there have been many studies addressing the simulation of COVID-19's spatial transmission model of infectious disease in time. However, very few studies have focused on the effect of the epidemic environment variables in which an individual lives on the individual's behavioral logic leading to changes in the overall epidemic transmission trend at larger scales. In this study, we applied Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) to modeling individual behavioral logistics, combined with Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) to perform "Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed" (SEIR) simulation of the independent individual behavior affecting the overall trend change. Our objective was to simulate the spatiotemporal spread of diseases using the Bengaluru Urban District, India as a case study. The results show that the simulation results are highly consistent with the observed reality, in terms of trends, with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) value of 0.39. Notably, our approach reveals a subtle link between individual motivation and infection-recovery dynamics, highlighting how individual behavior can significantly impact broader patterns of transmission. These insights have potential implications for epidemiologic strategies and public health interventions, providing data-driven insights into behavioral impacts on epidemic spread. By integrating behavioral modeling with epidemic simulation, our study underscores the importance of considering individual and collective behavior in designing sustainable public health policies and interventions.

AB In the U.S. inpatient payment system, the Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) is pivotal, but its assignment process is inefficient. The study introduces DRG-LLaMA, an advanced large language model (LLM) fine-tuned on clinical notes to enhance DRGs assignment. Utilizing LLaMA as the foundational model and optimizing it through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on 236,192 MIMIC-IV discharge summaries, our DRG-LLaMA -7B model exhibited a noteworthy macro-averaged F1 score of 0.327, a top-1 prediction accuracy of 52.0%, and a macro-averaged Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.986, with a maximum input token length of 512. This model surpassed the performance of prior leading models in DRG prediction, showing a relative improvement of 40.3% and 35.7% in macro-averaged F1 score compared to ClinicalBERT and CAML, respectively. Applied to base DRG and complication or comorbidity (CC)/major complication or comorbidity (MCC) prediction, DRG-LLaMA achieved a top-1 prediction accuracy of 67.8% and 67.5%, respectively. Additionally, our findings indicate that DRG-LLaMA 's performance correlates with increased model parameters and input context lengths.

AB There has been significant progress in improving the performance of graph neural networks (GNNs) through enhancements in graph data, model architecture design, and training strategies. For fairness in graphs, recent studies achieve fair representations and predictions through either graph data pre-processing (e.g., node feature masking, and topology rewiring) or fair training strategies (e.g., regularization, adversarial debiasing, and fair contrastive learning). How to achieve fairness in graphs from the model architecture perspective is less explored. More importantly, GNNs exhibit worse fairness performance compared to multilayer perception since their model architecture (i.e., neighbor aggregation) amplifies biases. To this end, we aim to achieve fairness via a new GNN architecture. We propose Fair Message Passing (FMP) designed within a unified optimization framework for GNNs. Notably, FMP explicitly renders sensitive attribute usage in forward propagation for node classification task using cross-entropy loss without data pre-processing. In FMP, the aggregation is first adopted to utilize neighbors' information and then the bias mitigation step explicitly pushes demographic group node presentation centers together. In this way, FMP scheme can aggregate useful information from neighbors and mitigate bias to achieve better fairness and prediction tradeoff performance. Experiments on node classification tasks demonstrate that the proposed FMP outperforms several baselines in terms of fairness and accuracy on three real-world datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/zhimengj0326/FMP.

   Analysis
AB Communities and cities are becoming vulnerable due to climate change-induced disasters such as heat waves, flooding, landslides, and droughts. The severity and increased frequency of these extreme events have demanded a resilience plan in the major cities to combat extreme weather events, which requires a systematic community vulnerability assessment. However, the specific impact of extreme events such as high heat waves on community vulnerability has been difficult to measure due to the unpredictability of weather patterns and events. Further, compounding the effects of building and built environment characteristics, the social and behavioral characteristics of households can result in differing levels of vulnerability to extreme temperature events. Even though many studies have discussed social vulnerability based on community demographics, the compounding effect has not been fully explored. When it comes to thermal resilience against extreme weather events, socially vulnerable communities are more likely to be affected by extreme heat due to a lack of thermal-resilient houses. In this research, Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS-2 test) test was used to extend the relationship between building features data and the social vulnerability index of the city of Philadelphia. The outcome of this research strengthens our understanding of how social vulnerability and building resilience are correlated, also in the future to build community prototypes that integrate building features and social vulnerability to simulate community response against extreme weather events.

AB While open-ended self-explanations have been shown to promote robust learning in multiple studies, they pose significant challenges to automated grading and feedback in technology-enhanced learning, due to the unconstrained nature of the students' input. Our work investigates whether recent advances in Large Language Models, and in particular ChatGPT, can address this issue. Using decimal exercises and student data from a prior study of the learning game Decimal Point, with more than 5,000 open-ended self-explanation responses, we investigate ChatGPT's capability in (1) solving the in-game exercises, (2) determining the correctness of students' answers, and (3) providing meaningful feedback to incorrect answers. Our results showed that ChatGPT can respond well to conceptual questions, but struggled with decimal place values and number line problems. In addition, it was able to accurately assess the correctness of 75% of the students' answers and generated generally high-quality feedback, similar to human instructors. We conclude with a discussion of ChatGPT's strengths and weaknesses and suggest several venues for extending its use cases in digital teaching and learning.

AB Internet of Things (IoT) devices have been increasingly deployed in smart homes to automatically monitor and control their environments. Unfortunately, extensive recent research has shown that on-path external adversaries can infer and further fingerprint people's sensitive private information by analyzing IoT network traffic traces. In addition, most recent approaches that aim to defend against these malicious IoT traffic analytics cannot adequately protect user privacy with reasonable traffic overhead. In particular, these approaches often did not consider practical traffic reshaping limitations, user daily routine permitting, and user privacy protection preference in their design. To address these issues, we design a new low-cost, open source user- centric defense system-PrivacyGuard-that enables people to regain the privacy leakage control of their IoT devices while still permitting sophisticated IoT data analytics that is necessary for smart home automation. In essence, our approach employs intelligent deep convolutional generative adversarial network assisted IoT device traffic signature learning, long short-term memory based artificial traffic signature injection, and partial traffic reshaping to obfuscate private information that can be observed in IoT device traffic traces. We evaluate PrivacyGuard using IoT network traffic traces of 31 IoT devices from five smart homes and buildings. We find that PrivacyGuard can effectively prevent a wide range of state-of-the-art adversarial machine learning and deep learning based user in-home activity inference and fingerprinting attacks and help users achieve the balance between their IoT data utility and privacy preserving.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB Harnessing remote computation power over the Internet without the need for expensive hardware and making costly services available to mass users at a marginal cost gave birth to the concept of cloud computing. This survey provides a concise overview of the growing confluence of cloud computing, edge intelligence, and AI, with a focus on their revolutionary impact on the Internet of Things (IoT). The survey starts with a fundamental introduction to cloud computing, overviewing its key parts and the services offered by different service providers. We then discuss how AI is improving cloud capabilities through its indigenous apps and services and is creating a smarter cloud. We then focus on the impact of AI in one of the popular cloud paradigms called edge cloud and discuss AI on Edge and AI for Edge. We discuss how AI implementation on edge devices is transforming edge and IoT networks by pulling cognitive processing closer to where the data originates, improving efficiency and response. We also discuss major cloud providers and their service offerings within the ecosystem and their respective use cases. Finally, this research looks ahead at new trends and future scopes that are now becoming possible at the confluence of the cloud, edge computing, and AI in IoT. The purpose of this study is to demystify edge intelligence, including cloud computing, edge computing, and AI, and to focus on their synergistic role in taking IoT technologies to new heights.

AB Structural model pruning is a prominent approach used for reducing the computational cost of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) before their deployment on resource-constrained devices. Yet, the majority of proposed ideas require a pretrained model before pruning, which is costly to secure. In this paper, we propose a novel structural pruning approach to jointly learn the weights and structurally prune architectures of CNN models. The core element of our method is a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent whose actions determine the pruning ratios of the CNN model's layers, and the resulting model's accuracy serves as its reward. We conduct the joint training and pruning by iteratively training the model's weights and the agent's policy, and we regularize the model's weights to align with the selected structure by the agent. The evolving model's weights result in a dynamic reward function for the agent, which prevents using prominent episodic RL methods with stationary environment assumption for our purpose. We address this challenge by designing a mechanism to model the complex changing dynamics of the reward function and provide a representation of it to the RL agent. To do so, we take a learnable embedding for each training epoch and employ a recurrent model to calculate a representation of the changing environment. We train the recurrent model and embeddings using a decoder model to reconstruct observed rewards. Such a design empowers our agent to effectively leverage episodic observations along with the environment representations to learn a proper policy to determine performant sub- networks of the CNN model. Our extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet using ResNets and MobileNets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

AB Research-validated multiple-choice questions comprise an easy-to-implement instructional tool that serves to scaffold student learning and formatively assess students' knowledge. We present findings from the implementation, in consecutive years, of a research-validated multiple-choice question sequence [referred to in this study as a clicker question sequence (CQS)] on quantum measurement as it applies to two-state quantum systems. This study was conducted in an advanced undergraduate quantum mechanics course, in both online and in-person learning environments across three years. Student learning was assessed after traditional lecture-based instruction in relevant concepts, and their performance was compared with that on a similar assessment given after engaging with the CQS. We analyze, compare, and discuss the trends observed in the three implementations.

AB Academic Abstract Advantaged group allies have multiple motives for supporting equality, raising questions about their sincerity. We draw upon the covariation model of attributions to explain how disadvantaged group members make attributions about whether advantaged group "allies" are sincerely motivated to empower the disadvantaged group. We propose an Attribution-Identity Model of Sincerity (AIMS) which posits that disadvantaged group members view advantaged group members as sincere allies when they support equality in the presence of inhibitory causes and in the absence of facilitative causes, exceed expectations for the advantaged group, and provide support across time and contexts. Furthermore, those who identify strongly with their disadvantaged group and perceive intergroup inequality as illegitimate are most motivated to ascertain the sincerity of advantaged group members' allyship. AIMS suggests how members of disadvantaged groups seek to maximize benefits and minimize risks of advantaged group members' allyship.Public Abstract Advantaged group members (e.g., men, White Americans) can act as allies for disadvantaged groups (e.g., women, Americans belonging to minoritized racial groups), but members of disadvantaged groups sometimes have reason to question whether their motives are sincere. We argue that members of disadvantaged groups view advantaged group allies as more sincere when they support equality when they do not stand to benefit from it and even when they stand to lose. We also argue that members of disadvantaged groups view advantaged group allies as more sincere when their support for equality goes beyond expectations for their advantaged group, consistently over time, and is not limited to particular situations, forms, or contexts. Members of disadvantaged groups like sincere allies, want to work with them, and feel safe around them. Sincere allies also serve as moral exemplars to other members of advantaged groups.

AB The ability of traditional room-conditioning systems to accommodate expanding information technology (IT) loads is limited in contemporary data centers, where the storage, storing, and processing of data have grown quickly as a result of evolving technological trends and rising demand for online services, which has also led to an increase in the amount of waste heat generated by IT equipment. Through the implementation of hybrid air and liquid cooling technologies, targeted, on-demand cooling is made possible by employing a variety of techniques, which include but are not limited to in- row, overhead, and rear door heat exchanger cooling systems. The ongoing trends of rising power densities of microprocessors and the presence of hot spots present a considerable challenge to the air-cooling system, which pushes it to its limits. As a result of the significant rise in IT power densities, single-phase cold plate cooling is becoming increasingly popular. However, the limited availability of a source of chilled water or constrained air distribution routes and the unavailability of raised floors are the main obstacles to the adoption of single-phase cooling technologies in many old data centers, which led to the use of liquid-to-air cooling distribution units (CDUs). These types of CDUs effectively cool servers by distributing liquid coolant into cooling loops that are installed on top of each server. The CDU pumps cold liquid to cooling loops attached to servers or chips, where they absorb heat. After returning the heated fluid to the CDU, the heat exchanger (HX) uses the cold air to eject the by the use of fans.
   One of the most common liquid cooling techniques will be examined in the current study based on different conditions for high power density racks (+50 kW). This paper investigates the cooling performance of a liquid-to-air in-row CDU in a test rack containing seven thermal test vehicles (TTVs) under various operational conditions, focusing on cooling capacity, HX effectiveness, and TTV case temperatures under different supply air temperatures (SAT). This test rig has the necessary instruments to monitor and analyze the experiments on both the liquid coolant and the air sides. Moreover, another experiment is conducted to assess the performance of the CDU that runs under different control fan schemes, as well as how the change of the control type will affect the supply fluid temperature and the TTV case temperatures at 10%, 50%, and 100% of the total delivered power. Finally, suggestions for the best control fan scheme to use for these systems and units are provided at the conclusion of the study.

ID AUTOREGRESSIVE CONDITIONAL DURATION; STOCHASTIC VOLATILITY
AB Volatility modeling is crucial in finance, especially when dealing with intraday transaction-level asset returns. The irregular and high-frequency nature of the data presents unique challenges. While stochastic volatility (SV) models are widely used for understanding patterns in volatility of daily stock returns which constitute regularly spaced time series, new classes of models must be introduced for analyzing volatility in irregularly spaced intraday data. Specifically these models must accommodate the random gaps between successive transactional events. By modeling the gaps using autoregressive conditional duration (ACD) models, we describe a hierarchical irregular SV autoregressive conditional duration (IR-SV-ACD) model for estimating and forecasting intertransaction gaps and the volatility of log-returns. We carry out the analysis in the Bayesian framework via the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm with No-U-turn sampler (NUTS) in R using the cmdstanr package. The fits and forecasts are obtained using Monte Carlo averages based on the posterior samples. We illustrate this approach using simulation studies and real data analysis for intraday prices available at microseconds level of health stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).

AB The gender disparity in STEM fields emerges early in development. This research examined children's explanations for this gap and investigated two approaches to enhance children's structural understanding that this imbalance is caused by societal, systematic barriers. Five- to 8-year-old children (N = 145) observed girls' underrepresentation in a STEM competition; the No Structural Information condition presented no additional information, the Structural: Between-Group Comparison (Between) condition compared boys' greater representation to girls' when boys had more opportunities to practice than girls, and the Structural: Within-Group Comparison (Within) condition compared girls' greater STEM representation when they had opportunities versus not. Children in the No Structural condition largely generated intrinsic explanations; in contrast, children in both structural conditions favored structural explanations for girls' lack of participation (Experiment 1) and achievement (Experiment 2). Importantly, each structural condition also had unique effects: Between raised children's fairness concerns, while Within increased children's selection of girls as teammates in a competitive STEM activity.

TI Universe as a nonlinear quantum simulation: Large-n limit of the
   central-spin model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
LA English
DT Article
ID MECHANICS; DYNAMICS; LINEARITY
AB We investigate models of nonlinear qubit evolution based on mappings to an n-qubit central-spin model (CSM) in the large -n limit, where mean-field theory is exact. Extending a theorem of Erd & ouml;s and Schlein [J. Stat. Phys. 134, 859 (2009)], we establish that the CSM is rigorously dual to a nonlinear qubit when n -> infinity. The duality supports a type of nonlinear quantum computation in systems, such as a condensate, where a large number of ancillas couple symmetrically to a central qubit. It also enables a gate-model implementation of nonlinear quantum simulation with a rigorous error bound. Two variants of the model, with and without coupling between ancillas, map to effective models with different nonlinearity and symmetry. Without coupling the CSM simulates initial-condition nonlinearity, where the Hamiltonian is a linear combination of tr(p0ax)ax, tr(p0ay)ay, and tr(p0az)az, where ax, ay, and az are Pauli matrices and p0 is the initial density matrix. With symmetric ancillas coupling it simulates linear combinations of tr(pax)ax, tr(pay)ay, and tr(paz)az, where p is the current state. This case can simulate qubit torsion, which has been shown by Abrams and Lloyd [Phys. Rev. Lett. 81, 3992 (1998)] to enable an exponential speedup for state discrimination in an idealized setting. The duality discussed here might also be interesting from a quantum foundation perspective. There has long been interest in whether quantum mechanics might possess some type of small unobserved nonlinearity. If not, what is the principle prohibiting it? The duality implies that there is not a sharp distinction between universes evolving according to linear and nonlinear quantum mechanics: A one-qubit universe prepared in a pure state |v) at the time of the big bang and symmetrically coupled to ancillas prepared in the same state would appear to evolve nonlinearly for any finite time t > 0 as long as there are exponentially many ancillas n >> exp[O(t)].

AB Analogies are known to be powerful tools for making sense of unfamiliar ideas in terms of already understood concepts. Science students regularly encounter unfamiliar ideas, such as microscopic objects that are invisible to our everyday experience and behaviors dictated by quantum mechanics. An understanding of basic concepts of quantum mechanics is useful in many disciplines, especially with the growing field of quantum information sciences and technologies. Physics researchers often use analogies in their own research and science communicators use them to make quantum ideas accessible to K-12 students and across STEM disciplines, but analogy use in upper-division teaching has been less researched. Our research goal is to understand how analogies are used to teach quantum mechanics, and specifically, what prior knowledge is used as a basis for analogies within two widely used quantum mechanics textbooks. This textbook analysis shows the most common bases for analogies include: mathematical structures from linear algebra, which are applied to model quantum systems; everyday life examples, which are used to make quantum systems more familiar and understandable; and macroscopic classical phenomena, which are used to highlight differences between classical and quantum mechanics. We also find authors use different conventions, based on the various cue words that authors use to indicate analogy-based reasoning. In the STEM classroom, this research has implications for enhancing student learning about abstract topics in science.

AB This paper studies the problem of designing a certified vision-based state estimator for autonomous landing systems. In such a system, a neural network (NN) processes images from a camera to estimate the aircraft's relative position with respect to the runway. We propose an algorithm to design such NNs with certified properties in terms of their ability to detect runways and provide accurate state estimation. At the heart of our approach is the use of geometric models of perspective cameras to obtain a mathematical model that captures the relation between the aircraft states and the inputs. We show that such geometric models enjoy mixed monotonicity properties that can be used to design state estimators with certifiable error bounds. We show the effectiveness of the proposed approach using an experimental testbed on data collected from event-based cameras.

AB Recent advancements in deep learning have spotlighted a crucial privacy vulnerability to membership inference attack (MIA), where adversaries can determine if specific data was present in a training set, thus potentially revealing sensitive information. In this paper, we introduce a technique, weighted smoothing (WS), to mitigate MIA risks. Our approach is anchored on the observation that training samples differ in their vulnerability to MIA, primarily based on their distance to clusters of similar samples. The intuition is clusters will make model predictions more confident and increase MIA risks. Thus WS strategically introduces noise to training samples, depending on whether they are near a cluster or isolated. We evaluate WS against MIAs on multiple benchmark datasets and model architectures, demonstrating its effectiveness. We publish code at https://github.com/BennyTMT/weighted- smoothing.

AB Despite increased attempts to express equality in speech, biases often leak out through subtle linguistic cues. For example, the subject-complement statement (SCS, "Girls are as good as boys at math") is used to advocate for equality but often reinforces gender stereotypes (boys are the standard against which girls are judged). We ask whether stereotypes conveyed by SCS can be counteracted by gesture. Two preregistered studies with 8- to 11- y- old children (N = 320 total) investigate whether an equal gesture-two palms placed at the same height-mitigates the gender stereotype induced by SCS. Children who saw the equal gesture along with SCS were more likely to express egalitarian beliefs than children who saw no gesture or an unequal gesture. Children can extract meaning from gesture when making stereotypical inferences, suggesting that the equal gesture may prove to be an innovative, and simple, intervention to counteract stereotypes introduced by subtle language.

AB The study reported in the paper focused on applying a set of affective body gestures extracted from the Geneva Multimodal Emotion Portrayals (GEMEP) dataset to two pedagogical animated agents in an online lecture context and studying the effects of those gestures on subjects' perception of the agents' emotions. 131 participants completed an online survey where they watched different animations featuring a female and a male animated agent expressing six emotions (anger, joy, sadness, disgust, fear, and surprise) while delivering a lecture segment. After watching the animations, subjects were asked to identify the agents' emotions. Findings showed that only one expression of the angry emotion by the female agent was recognized with an acceptable level of accuracy (recognition rate >75%), while the remaining emotions showed low recognition rates ranging from 1.5% to 64%. A mapping of the results on Russel's Circumplex model of emotion showed that participants' identification of levels of emotion arousal and valence was slightly more accurate than recognition of emotion quality but still low (recognition rates <75% for 5 out of 6 emotions). Results suggest that hand and arm gestures alone are not sufficient for conveying the agent's emotion type and the levels of emotion valence and arousal.

AB Models of nonlinear quantum computation based on deterministic positive trace-preserving (PTP) channels and evolution equations are investigated. The models are defined in any finite Hilbert space, but the main results are for dimension N=2$ N \! = \! 2$. For every normalizable linear or nonlinear positive map phi on bounded linear operators X, there is an associated normalized PTP channel phi(X)/tr[phi(X)]$ \phi (X) / {\rm tr}[\phi (X)]$. Normalized PTP channels include unitary mean field theories, such as the Gross-Pitaevskii equation for interacting bosons, as well as models of linear and nonlinear dissipation. They classify into four types, yielding three distinct forms of nonlinearity whose computational power are explored. In the qubit case, these channels support Bloch ball torsion and other distortions studied previously, where it has been shown that such nonlinearity can be used to increase the separation between a pair of close qubit states, suggesting an exponential speedup for state discrimination. Building on this idea, the authors argue that this operation can be made robust to noise by using dissipation to induce a bifurcation to a novel phase where a pair of attracting fixed points create an intrinsically fault-tolerant nonlinear state discriminator.

AB Attention layers-which map a sequence of inputs to a sequence of outputs-are core building blocks of the Transformer architecture which has achieved significant breakthroughs in modern artificial intelligence. This paper presents a rigorous theoretical study on the learning and generalization of a single multi-head attention layer, with activation function replaced by ReLU, which have recently shown comparable performance with the original Softmax activation. We consider the random feature setting where the attention layer has a large number of heads, with randomly sampled frozen query and key matrices, and trainable value matrices. We show that such a random-feature attention layer can express a broad class of target functions that are permutation invariant to the key vectors. We further provide quantitative excess risk bounds for learning these target functions from finite samples, using random feature attention with finitely many heads.
   Our results feature several implications unique to the attention structure compared with existing random features theory for neural networks, such as (1) Advantages over standard fully connected random-feature models; (2) Concrete and natural classes of functions that can be learned efficiently by a random-feature attention layer. Additionally, we show that the sampling distribution of the query-key matrix (the product of the query and key matrix) matters-A biased Gaussian random matrix results in better sample complexities over the standard zero-mean counterpart for learning certain natural target functions.Experiments on simulated data corroborate our theoretical findings and further illustrate the interplay between the sample size and the complexity of the target function.

AB This paper presents an ensemble control system for precise online manipulation of micro- and nanoscale objects. Existing wireless external actuation approaches exhibit global and coupled influences, hindering robust and simultaneous control of multiple particles. The proposed system incorporates the rotational dynamics of nanowires in fluid suspension and offers two control methods: a two-stage open-loop ensemble control law and a model-predictive ensemble control strategy. Simulation results demonstrate that both methods surpass the theoretical limits of simultaneous particle control. The model-predictive ensemble control method can control more nanowires, does not require pre-generated trajectories, and has a simpler validation process for control performance.

AB Logic reasoning has been critically needed in problem-solving and decision-making. Although Language Models (LMs) have demonstrated capabilities of handling multiple reasoning tasks (e.g., commonsense reasoning), their ability to reason complex mathematical problems, specifically propositional logic, remains largely underexplored. This lack of exploration can be attributed to the limited availability of annotated corpora. Here, we present a well-labeled propositional logic corpus, LOGICPRPBANK, containing 7093 Propositional Logic Statements (PLSs) across six mathematical subjects, to study a brand-new task of reasoning logical implication and equivalence. We benchmark LOGICPRPBANK with widely-used LMs to show that our corpus offers a useful resource for this challenging task and there is ample room for model improvement.

AB Exploratory data analysis can uncover interesting data insights from data. Current methods utilize "interestingness measures" designed based on system designers' perspectives, thus inherently restricting the insights to their defined scope. These systems, consequently, may not adequately represent a broader range of user interests. Furthermore, most existing approaches that formulate "interestingness measure" are rule-based, which makes them inevitably brittle and often requires holistic re-design when new user needs are discovered.
   This paper presents a data-driven technique for deriving an "interestingness measure" that learns from annotated data. We further develop an innovative annotation algorithm that significantly reduces the annotation cost, and an insight synthesis algorithm based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method for efficient discovery of interesting insights. We consolidate these ideas into a system. Our experimental outcomes and user studies demonstrate that DAISY can effectively discover a broad range of interesting insights, thereby substantially advancing the current state-of-the-art.

   management
AB Machine learning models contain much information about the training dataset, so even if some data points are deleted, the private information can still be inferred. To counteract this problem, "machine unlearning", as an emerging data management approach, is proposed to remove data from the databases and the influence of data from the trained models. Such a technique is vital in the current era of data-driven applications, where the privacy and security of users can be guaranteed. Yet, machine unlearning is still in its early stage, and there are rare existing methods for machine unlearning in the federated setting that is a more practical and crucial scenario. Therefore, this paper investigates the federated machine unlearning problem where the local clients of a federated system intend to delete their local private data appropriately. The proposed method is termed Approximate Federated unlearning (Appro-Fun), which adopts differential privacy and second-order optimization to achieve (epsilon, delta)-approximate unlearning on trained models. Rigorous theoretic analysis presents the performance guarantee of Appro-Fun, and real-data experiments validate the advantages of Appro-Fun compared with the state-of-the-art.

AB This work contributes to nonlocal vector calculus as an indispensable mathematical tool for the study of nonlocal models that arises in a variety of applications. We define the nonlocal half-ball gradient, divergence and curl operators with general kernel functions (integrable or fractional type with finite or infinite supports) and study the associated nonlocal vector identities. We study the nonlocal function space on bounded domains associated with zero Dirichlet boundary conditions and the half-ball gradient operator and show it is a separable Hilbert space with smooth functions dense in it. A major result is the nonlocal Poincare inequality, based on which a few applications are discussed, and these include applications to nonlocal convection-diffusion, nonlocal correspondence model of linear elasticity and nonlocal Helmholtz decomposition on bounded domains.

AB Drug-drug interaction (DDI), as a possible result of drug combination treatment, could lead to adverse physiological reactions and increasing mortality rates of patients. Therefore, predicting potential DDI has always been an important and challenging problem. Owing to the extensive pharmacological research, we can access various drug-related features for DDI predictions; however, most of the existing works on DDI prediction do not incorporate comprehensive features to analyze the DDI patterns. Despite the high performance that the existing works have achieved, the incomplete and noisy information generated from limited sources usually leads to sub-optimal performance and poor generalization ability on the unknown DDI pairs. In this work, we propose a holistic framework, namely Multi-modality Feature Optimal Fusion for Drug-Drug Interaction Prediction (MOF-DDI), that incorporates features from multiple data sources to resolve the DDI predictions. Specifically, the proposed model jointly considers DDIs literature descriptions, biomedical knowledge graphs, and drug molecular structures to make the prediction. To overcome the issue induced by directly aggregating features in different modalities, we bring a new insight by mapping the representations learned from different sources to a unified hidden space before the combination. The empirical results show that MOF-DDI achieves a large performance gain on different DDI datasets compared with multiple state-of-the-art baselines, especially under the inductive setting.

AB Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative learning framework that enables edge devices to collaboratively learn a global model while keeping raw data locally. Although FL avoids leaking direct information from local datasets, sensitive information can still be inferred from the shared models. To address the privacy issue in FL, differential privacy (DP) mechanisms are leveraged to provide formal privacy guarantee. However, when deploying FL at the wireless edge with over-the-air computation, ensuring client-level DP faces significant challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel wireless FL scheme called private federated edge learning with sparsification (PFELS) to provide client-level DP guarantee with intrinsic channel noise while reducing communication and energy overhead and improving model accuracy. The key idea of PFELS is for each device to first compress its model update and then adaptively design the transmit power of the compressed model update according to the wireless channel status without any artificial noise addition. We provide a privacy analysis for PFELS and prove the convergence of PFELS under general non-convex and non-IID settings. Experimental results show that compared with prior work, PFELS can improve the accuracy with the same DP guarantee and save communication and energy costs simultaneously.

DE Mutation Operators; Evolutionary Algorithms; Multimodal Optimisation
AB Mutation operators are crucial for evolutionary algorithms to make progress through a search landscape. Sometimes a mutation strategy that works in one part of the landscape is less effective in other regions of the landscape. If nothing is known about the best mutation operator, many strategies (such as self-adaptation, heavy-tailed mutation, variable neighborhood search) exist to overcome this. However, in some cases, some limited information may be available, either a priori or after probing. In this paper, we study the setting of a mixture of binomial distributions for pseudo-Boolean optimization. We show that, when a limited amount of information is available, evolutionary algorithms using mutation based on a mixture of binomial distributions can hill-climb and escape local optima efficiently.

AB With the advent of byte-addressable memory devices, such as CXL memory, persistent memory, and storage-class memory, tiered memory systems have become a reality. Page migration is the de facto method within operating systems for managing tiered memory. It aims to bring hot data whenever possible into fast memory to optimize the performance of data accesses while using slow memory to accommodate data spilled from fast memory. While the existing research has demonstrated the effectiveness of various optimizations on page migration, it falls short of addressing a fundamental question: Is exclusive memory tiering, in which a page is either present in fast memory or slow memory, but not both simultaneously, the optimal strategy for tiered memory management?
   We demonstrate that page migration-based exclusive memory tiering suffers significant performance degradation when fast memory is under pressure. In this paper, we propose nonexclusive memory tiering, a page management strategy that retains a copy of pages recently promoted from slow memory to fast memory to mitigate memory thrashing. To enable non-exclusive memory tiering, we develop NOMAD, a new page management mechanism for Linux that features transactional page migration and page shadowing. NOMAD helps remove page migration off the critical path of program execution and makes migration completely asynchronous. Evaluations with carefully crafted micro-benchmarks and real-world applications show that NOMAD is able to achieve up to 6x performance improvement over the state-of-the-art transparent page placement (TPP) approach in Linux when under memory pressure. We also compare NOMAD with a recently proposed hardware-assisted, access sampling-based page migration approach and demonstrate NOMAD's strengths and potential weaknesses in various scenarios.

ID REGRESSION
AB Partial correlations (PCs) and the related inverse covariance matrix adopted by graphical lasso, are widely applicable tools for learning graph connectivity given nodal observations. The resultant estimators however, can be sensitive to outliers. Robust approaches developed so far to cope with outliers do not (explicitly) account for nonlinear interactions possibly present among nodal processes. This can hurt the identification of graph connectivity, merely due to model mismatch. To overcome this limitation, a novel formulation of robust PC is introduced based on nonlinear kernel functions. The proposed scheme leverages robust ridge regression techniques, spectral Fourier feature based kernel approximants, and robust association measures. Numerical tests on synthetic and real data illustrate the potential of the novel approach.

DE Bias mitigation; Limitied annotation
AB Existing work on fairness modeling commonly assumes that sensitive attributes for all instances are fully available, which may not be true in many real-world applications due to the high cost of acquiring sensitive information. When sensitive attributes are not disclosed or available, it is needed to manually annotate a small part of the training data to mitigate bias. However, the skewed distribution across different sensitive groups preserves the skewness of the original dataset in the annotated subset, which leads to non-optimal bias mitigation. To tackle this challenge, we propose Active Penalization Of Discrimination (APOD), an interactive framework to guide the limited annotations towards maximally eliminating the effect of algorithmic bias. The proposed APOD integrates discrimination penalization with active instance selection to efficiently utilize the limited annotation budget, and it is theoretically proved to be capable of bounding the algorithmic bias. According to the evaluation on five benchmark datasets, APOD outperforms the state-of-the-arts baseline methods under the limited annotation budget, and shows comparable performance to fully annotated bias mitigation, which demonstrates that APOD could benefit real-world applications when sensitive information is limited. The source code of the proposed method is available at: https://github.com/guanchuwang/APOD-fairness.

AB Research within sociotechnical domains, such as software engineering, fundamentally requires the human perspective. Nevertheless, traditional qualitative data collection methods suffer from difficulties in participant recruitment, scaling, and labor intensity. This vision paper proposes a novel approach to qualitative data collection in software engineering research by harnessing the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI), especially large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and multimodal foundation models. We explore the potential of AI-generated synthetic text as an alternative source of qualitative data, discussing how LLMs can replicate human responses and behaviors in research settings. We discuss AI applications in emulating humans in interviews, focus groups, surveys, observational studies, and user evaluations. We discuss open problems and research opportunities to implement this vision. In the future, an integrated approach where both AI and human-generated data coexist will likely yield the most effective outcomes.

AB Evaluating the quality of automatically generated question items has been a long standing challenge. In this paper, we leverage LLMs to simulate student profiles and generate responses to multiplechoice questions (MCQs). The generative students' responses to MCQs can further support question item evaluation. We propose Generative Students, a prompt architecture designed based on the KLI framework. A generative student profile is a function of the list of knowledge components the student has mastered, has confusion about or has no evidence of knowledge of. We instantiate the Generative Students concept on the subject domain of heuristic evaluation. We created 45 generative students using GPT-4 and had them respond to 20 MCQs. We found that the generative students produced logical and believable responses that were aligned with their profiles. We then compared the generative students' responses to real students' responses on the same set of MCQs and found a high correlation. Moreover, there was considerable overlap in the difficult questions identified by generative students and real students. A subsequent case study demonstrated that an instructor could improve question quality based on the signals provided by Generative Students.

ID NONVOLATILE MEMORY; PERFORMANCE; STORAGE; ACCESS; CACHE; INDEX
AB Nonvolatile memory (NVM) technologies have gained increasing attention thanks to their density and durability benefits. However, leveraging NVM can cause a crash consistency issue. For example, if a younger store is evicted (persisted) to NVM from volatile caches before an older one and power failure occurs in between, it might be impossible to correctly resume the interrupted program in the wake of the failure. Traditionally, addressing this issue involves expensive persist barriers for enforcing the original store order, which not only incurs a high run-time overhead but also places a significant burden on users due to the difficulty of persistent programming.
   To this end, this paper presents cWSP, compiler/architecture codesign for lightweight yet performant whole-system persistence (WSP). In particular, cWSP compiler partitions not only user applications but also OS and runtime libraries into a series of recoverable regions (epochs), thus enabling persistence and crash consistency for the entire software stack. To achieve high-performance crash consistency, cWSP leverages advanced compiler optimizations for checkpointing a minimal set of registers and proposes simple hardware support for expediting data persistence on the cheap. Experimental results with 37 applications from SPEC CPU2006/2017, DOE Mini-apps, SPLASH3, WHISPER, and STAMP, show that cWSP incurs an average runtime overhead of 6%, outperforming the state-of-the-art work with a significant margin.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
LA English
DT Article
ID CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORK; ANDERSON LOCALIZATION; DIFFUSION; ABSENCE
AB A transition of quantum walk induced by classical randomness changes the probability distribution of the walker from a two-peak structure to a single-peak one when the random parameter exceeds a critical value. We first establish the generality of the localization by showing its emergence in the presence of random rotation or translation. The transition point can be located manually by examining the probability distribution, momentum of inertia, and inverse participation ratio. As a comparison, we implement three supervised machine learning methods, the support vector machine (SVM), multilayer perceptron neural network, and convolutional neural network with the same data and show they are able to identify the transition. While the SVM sometimes underestimates the exponents compared to the manual methods, the two neural-network methods show more deviations for the case with random translation due to the fluctuating probability distributions. Our work illustrates potentials and challenges facing machine learning of physical systems with mixed quantum and classical probabilities.

AB Public transportation provides vital connectivity to people with disabilities, facilitating access to work, education, and health services. While modern navigation applications provide a suite of information about transit options-including real-time updates about bus or train arrivals-they lack data about the accessibility of the transit stops themselves. Bus stop features such as seatings, shelters, and landing areas are critical, but few cities provide this information. In this demo paper, we introduce BusStopCV, a Human+AI web prototype for scalably collecting data on bus stop features using real-time computer vision and human labeling. We describe BusStopCV's design, custom training with the YOLOv8 model, and an evaluation of 100 randomly selected bus stops in Seattle, WA. Our findings demonstrate the potential of BusStopCV and highlight opportunities for future work.

AB In recent decades, due to the lucrative profits, the crime of drug trafficking has evolved with modern technologies. Social media, as one of the popular online platforms, have become direct-to-consumer intermediaries for illicit drug trafficking communities to promote and trade drugs. These group -wise drug trafficking activities pose significant challenges to public health and safety, requiring urgent measures to address this issue. However, existing works against the imminent problem still face limitations, such as primarily analyzing individual roles from a single perspective, ignoring the group -wise relationships, and requiring sufficient labeled samples for model training. To this end, we propose a novel HyperGraph Contrastive Learning framework called HyGCL-DC that employs hypergraph to model the higher-order relationships among users to detect Drug trafficking Communities. Firstly, we build a hypergraph called Twitter-HyDrug including online user nodes and four types of hyperedges to depict the rich group -wise relationships among these users. Then, we leverage hypergraph neural networks to model the rich relationships among nodes and hyperedges in the drug trafficking hypergraph. Furthermore, we design a hypergraph self-supervised contrast module, which integrates the augmentation from the structure view and the attribute view to enhance hypergraph representation learning over unlabeled data. Filially, we design an end -to -end framework that combines the self-supervised contrastive module and the supervised module to classify online drug trafficking communities. To comprehensively study the online drug trafficking problem and evaluate our model, we conduct extensive experiments over Twitter-HyDrug and three citation benchmark hypergraph datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. Our new data and source code are available at https://github.com/HyGCL-DC.

AB In this paper, we present a novel Model Predictive Control method for autonomous robot planning and control subject to arbitrary forms of uncertainty. The proposed Risk-Aware Model Predictive Path Integral (RA-MPPI) control utilizes the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) measure to generate optimal control actions for safety-critical robotic applications. Different from most existing Stochastic MPCs and CVaR optimization methods that linearize the original dynamics and formulate control tasks as convex programs, the proposed method directly uses the original dynamics without restricting the form of the cost functions or the noise. We apply the novel RA-MPPI controller to an autonomous vehicle to perform aggressive driving maneuvers in cluttered environments. Our simulations and experiments show that the proposed RA-MPPI controller can achieve similar lap times with the baseline MPPI controller while encountering significantly fewer collisions. The proposed controller performs online computation at an update frequency of up to 80 Hz, utilizing modern Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to multi-thread the generation of trajectories as well as the CVaR values.

AB This paper presents PPA (Persistent Processor Architecture), simple microarchitectural support for lightweight yet performant wholesystem persistence. PPA offers fully transparent crash consistency to all sorts of program covering the entire computing stack and even legacy applications without any source code change or recompilation. As a basis for crash consistency, PPA leverages so-called store integrity that preserves store operands during program execution, persists them on impending power failure, and replays the stores when power comes back. In particular, PPA realizes the store integrity via hardware by keeping the operands in a physical register file (PRF), though the stores are committed. Such store integrity enforcement leads to region-level persistence, i.e., whenever PRF runs out, PPA starts a new region after ensuring that all stores of the prior region have already been written to persistent memory. To minimize the pipeline stall across regions, PPA writes back the stores of each region asynchronously, overlapping their persistence latency with the execution of other instructions in the region. The experimental results with 41 applications from SPEC CPU2006/2017, SPLASH3, STAMP, WHISPER, and DOE Mini-apps show that PPA incurs only a 2% average run-time overhead and a 0.005% areal cost, while the state-of-the-art work suffers a 26% overhead along with prohibitively high hardware and energy costs.

AB Learning from preference-based feedback has recently gained considerable traction as a promising approach to align generative models with human interests. Instead of relying on numerical rewards, the generative models are trained using reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). These approaches first solicit feedback from human labelers typically in the form of pairwise comparisons between two possible actions, then estimate a reward model using these comparisons, and finally employ a policy based on the estimated reward model. An adversarial attack in any step of the above pipeline might reveal private and sensitive information of human labelers. In this work, we adopt the notion of label differential privacy (DP) and focus on the problem of reward estimation from preference-based feedback while protecting privacy of each individual labelers. Specifically, we consider the parametric Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model for such pairwise comparison feedback involving a latent reward parameter.theta*is an element of R-d. Within a standard minimax estimation framework, we provide tight upper and lower bounds on the error in estimating.* under both local and central models of DP. We show, for a given privacy budget e and number of samples n, that the additional cost to ensure label-DP under local model is Theta(1/e(epsilon-1) root d/n, while it is Theta(poly(d)/epsilon n) under the weaker central model. We perform simulations on synthetic data that corroborate these theoretical results.

AB This paper introduces a novel Lagrangian fluid solver based on covector flow maps. We aim to address the challenges of establishing a robust flow-map solver for incompressible fluids under complex boundary conditions. Our key idea is to use particle trajectories to establish precise flow maps and tailor path integrals of physical quantities along these trajectories to reformulate the Poisson problem during the projection step. We devise a decoupling mechanism based on path-integral identities from flow-map theory. This mechanism integrates long-range flow maps for the main fluid body into a short-range projection framework, ensuring a robust treatment of free boundaries. We show that our method can effectively transform a long-range projection problem with integral boundaries into a Poisson problem with standard boundary conditions - specifically, zero Dirichlet on the free surface and zero Neumann on solid boundaries. This transformation significantly enhances robustness and accuracy, extending the applicability of flow-map methods to complex free-surface problems.

AB Learning generative models is challenging for a network edge node with limited data and computing power. Since tasks in similar environments share a model similarity, it is plausible to leverage pretrained generative models from other edge nodes. Appealing to optimal transport theory tailored toward Wasserstein-1 generative adversarial networks (WGANs), this study aims to develop a framework that systematically optimizes continual learning of generative models using local data at the edge node while exploiting adaptive coalescence of pretrained generative models. Specifically, by treating the knowledge transfer from other nodes as Wasserstein balls centered around their pretrained models, continual learning of generative models is cast as a constrained optimization problem, which is further reduced to a Wasserstein-1 barycenter problem. A two-stage approach is devised accordingly: 1) the barycenters among the pretrained models are computed offline, where displacement interpolation is used as the theoretic foundation for finding adaptive barycenters via a "recursive" WGAN configuration and 2) the barycenter computed offline is used as metamodel initialization for continual learning, and then, fast adaptation is carried out to find the generative model using the local samples at the target edge node. Finally, a weight ternarization method, based on joint optimization of weights and threshold for quantization, is developed to compress the generative model further. Extensive experimental studies corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

DE Differential Privacy; Resource Allocation; Privacy Amplification
AB Recent studies have shown that systems with limited resources like Metadata-private Messenger (MPM) suffer from side-channel attacks under resource allocation (RA). In the case of MPM, which is designed to keep the identities and activities of both callers and callees private from network adversaries, an attacker can compromise a victim's friends and keep calling the victim to infer whether the victim is busy, which breaks the privacy guarantee of MPM.
   In this work, we systematically study how to protect the privacy of RA against the aforementioned attacks with differential privacy (DP). Though DP has been tested by Angel et al. (IEEE S&P 2020) in protecting RA, which lets the allocator add dummy requests following a biased Laplace distribution to hide the existence of the victim and then assign resources randomly, we identify that this approach does not leverage the uncertainty from the attacker's view, thus leading to a loose bound of DP. As a result, more than 40% of the resources are wasted to satisfy DP. To make the DP solutions more practical, we precisely model the RA process from the attacker's view and present a thorough study of the noisy allocation mechanisms by considering different distributions, scales, and biases of noise. We identify four new mechanisms and prove that they all follow..-DP (Angel et al. follow (..,..)-DP). Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we found these approaches can outperform Angel et al. by a large margin in privacy-utility tradeoff.

AB Precise manipulation of micro- and nanowires through visual feedback is challenging because of the difficulty of observing their motion along the line-of-sight of microscopes. In this paper, we present a novel auto-focusing and visual posture estimation strategy for identifying three-dimensional (3D) poses for one or more moving micro- and nanowires under bright-field microscopes. The proposed method integrates classic passive auto-focusing algorithms, rule-based hill-climb methods, and an automatic and efficient scheme to estimate the positions and orientations of moving wires. Extensive experimental results demonstrate high accuracy and efficiency of the tracking and 3D pose estimation compared to traditional methods. This work lays the foundation for automated control of micro- and nano-robots in 3D microfluidic environments.

The alternative Bayes factors are derived for the statistical analyses most commonly used in psychological research - one-sample and two-sample t tests, regression, and ANOVA analyses. They possess the same desirable theoretical and practical properties as the default Bayes factors and satisfy additional theoretical desiderata while mitigating against two features of the default priors that we consider implausible. They can be conveniently computed via an R package that we provide. Furthermore, hypothesis tests based on Bayes factors and those based on significance tests are juxtaposed. This discussion leads to the insight that default Bayes factors as well as the alternative Bayes factors are equivalent to test-statistic-based Bayes factors as proposed by Johnson. Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series B: Statistical Methodology, 67, 689-701. (2005). We highlight test-statistic-based Bayes factors as a general approach to Bayes-factor computation that is applicable to many hypothesis-testing problems for which an effect-size measure has been proposed and for which test power can be computed.

AB Severe lattice distortion is a prominent feature of high-entropy alloys (HEAs) considered a reason for many of those alloys' properties. Nevertheless, accurate characterizations of lattice distortion are still scarce to only cover a tiny fraction of HEA's giant composition space due to the expensive experimental or computational costs. Here we present a physics-informed statistical model to efficiently produce high-throughput lattice distortion predictions for refractory non-dilute/high-entropy alloys (RHEAs) in a 10-element composition space. The model offers improved accuracy over conventional methods for fast estimates of lattice distortion by making predictions based on physical properties of interatomic bonding rather than atomic size mismatch of pure elements. The modeling of lattice distortion also implements a predictive model for yield strengths of RHEAs validated by various sets of experimental data. Combining our previous model on intrinsic ductility, a data mining design framework is demonstrated for efficient exploration of strong and ductile single-phase RHEAs.

AB Thermal decomposition of cycloheptane was studied using flash pyrolysis coupled with vacuum ultraviolet (118.2 nm) single photon ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry at temperatures ranging from 295 K to 1380 K. C-C bond breaking of cycloheptane leading to the 1,7-heptyl diradical was considered as the initiation step. The 1,7-heptyl diradical could readily isomerize to 1-heptene and decompose into several fragments, with dissociation to center dot C4H9 and center dot C3H5 as the predominant product channel. The 1,7-heptyl diradical could undergo direct dissociation, as evidenced by the production of the C5H10 species. Quantum chemistry calculations at UCCSD(T)/cc-pVDZ//UB3LYP/cc-pVDZ level of theory on the initial reaction pathways of cycloheptane were also carried out to support the experimental observations. Other possible initiation channels, as well as some secondary reaction products, were also identified.

AB Undergraduates with depression report that they would benefit from science role models who also have depression. If biology instructors who have depression reveal it to their students, it could help meet this need. However, it is unknown how instructors revealing their depression would impact all undergraduate science students, not just those with depression, and whether it would cause some students to have a negative perception of the instructor. To address this gap, an instructor of an undergraduate physiology course revealed her depression to the whole class in less than 3 s on two occasions. Undergraduates were surveyed about whether they remembered the instructor revealing depression, whether they perceived it to be appropriate, and what impact it had on them. Of the 289 undergraduates who participated in the survey, 90.6% remembered the instructor revealing her depression. Seventy-two percent of those students reported that the instructor revealing depression had a positive impact on them, 21.3% reported no impact, and 6.7% reported a negative impact. Women were disproportionately likely to report that the instructor revealing depression had a positive impact on the student/instructor relationship and the instructor's approachability. LGBTQ+ students were disproportionately likely to report that the instructor revealing depression had a positive impact on the extent the classroom feels inclusive and students with more severe depressive symptoms were more likely to report that it normalized depression broadly and in the context of science. This work adds to recent studies highlighting the potentially positive impact of instructors revealing their concealable stigmatized identities to undergraduates in class. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This research highlights the potential for instructors with depression to have a positive impact on students in their college science courses.

AB Cloud-based science labs allow science classrooms to engage in authentic science inquiry without the logistical and procedural complexities of real hands-on laboratories. A major challenge is to understand the variation of teaching contexts and needs and the implication for technology design. Utilizing an Biology Cloud Lab (BCL) for real-time experimentation that had been deployed as Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) previously, we now execute three in-depth case studies of how K-12 teachers (with similar to 200 students) adapt and deploy this BCL and MOOC material for their own class-room needs. We uncovered that teachers differed in their diverse range of learning objectives (e.g., large-scale data analysis vs. computational modeling based on real data), how the teachers were able to adapt the BCL and MOOC material differently to meet their respective curricular needs, and how logistically complex and time intensive processes can be automated to allow teachers and students to focus on key practices. This work reveals the need and design rules for well-standardized and modularized cloud-based science laboratories and accompanying learning materials to then enable rich inquiry based learning activities that work at scale while also being highly customizable to the local classroom contexts.

ID RECOGNITION
AB Bodily expressed emotion understanding (BEEU) aims to automatically recognize human emotional expressions from body movements. Psychological research has demonstrated that people often move using specific motor elements to convey emotions. This work takes three steps to integrate human motor elements to study BEEU. First, we introduce BoME (body motor elements), a highly precise dataset for human motor elements. Second, we apply baseline models to estimate these elements on BoME, showing that deep learning methods are capable of learning effective representations of human movement. Finally, we propose a dual-source solution to enhance the BEEU model with the BoME dataset, which trains with both motor element and emotion labels and simultaneously produces predictions for both. Through experiments on the BoLD in-the-wild emotion understanding benchmark, we showcase the significant benefit of our approach. These results may inspire further research utilizing human motor elements for emotion understanding and mental health analysis.

TI Lower Bounds for Learning in Revealing POMDPs

AB This paper studies the fundamental limits of reinforcement learning (RL) in the challenging partially observable setting. While it is well-established that learning in Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) requires exponentially many samples in the worst case, a surge of recent work shows that polynomial sample complexities are achievable under the revealing condition-A natural condition that requires the observables to reveal some information about the unobserved latent states. However, the fundamental limits for learning in revealing POMDPs are much less understood, with existing lower bounds being rather preliminary and having substantial gaps from the current best upper bounds.
   We establish strong PAC and regret lower bounds for learning in revealing POMDPs. Our lower bounds scale polynomially in all relevant problem parameters in a multiplicative fashion, and achieve significantly smaller gaps against the current best upper bounds, providing a solid starting point for future studies. In particular, for multi-step revealing POMDPs, we show that (1) the latent state-space dependence is at least Omega(S-1.5) in the PAC sample complexity, which is notably harder than the (Theta) over tilde (S) scaling for fully-observable MDPs; (2) Any polynomial sublinear regret is at least Omega(T-2/3), suggesting its fundamental difference from the single-step case where (O) over tilde(root T) regret is achievable. Technically, our hard instance construction adapts techniques in distribution testing, which is new to the RL literature and may be of independent interest. We also complement our results with new sharp regret upper bounds for strongly B-stable PSRs, which include single-step revealing POMDPs as a special case.

DE Amazon Alexa; Policy Violation Detection; Static Analysis
AB The Amazon Alexa marketplace is the largest Voice Personal Assistant (VPA) platform with over 100,000 voice applications (i.e., skills) published to the skills store. In an effort to maintain the quality and trustworthiness of voice-apps, Amazon Alexa has implemented a set of policy requirements to be adhered to by third-party skill developers. However, recent works reveal the prevalence of policy-violating skills in the current skills store. To understand the causes of policy violations in skills, we first conduct a user study with 34 third-party skill developers focusing on whether they are aware of the various policy requirements defined by the Amazon Alexa platform. Our user study results show that there is a notable gap between VPA's policy requirements and skill developers' practices. As a result, it is inevitable that policy-violating skills will be published.
   To prevent the inflow of new policy-breaking skills to the skills store from the source, it is critical to identify potential policy violations at the development phase. In this work, we design and develop SKILLSCANNER, an efficient static code analysis tool to facilitate third-party developers to detect policy violations early in the skill development lifecycle. To evaluate the performance of SKILLSCANNER, we conducted an empirical study on 2,451 open source skills collected from GitHub. SKILLSCANNER effectively identified 1,328 different policy violations from 786 skills. Our results suggest that 32% of these policy violations are introduced through code duplication (i.e., code copy and paste). In particular, we found that 42 skill code examples from potential Alexa's official accounts (e.g., "alexa" and "alexa-samples" on GitHub) contain policy violations, which lead to 81 policy violations in other skills due to the copy-pasted code snippets from these Alexa's code examples.

AB This paper presents SweepCache, a new compiler/architecture codesign scheme that can equip energy harvesting systems with a volatile cache in a performant yet lightweight way. Unlike prior justin-time checkpointing designs that persists volatile data just before power failure and thus dedicates additional energy, SweepCache partitions program into a series of recoverable regions and persists stores at region granularity to fully utilize harvested energy for computation. In particular, SweepCache introduces persist bufferas a redo buffer resident in nonvolatile memory (NVM)-to keep the main memory consistent across power failure while persisting region's stores in a failure-atomic manner. Specifically, for writebacks during region execution, SweepCache saves their cachelines to the persist buffer. At each region end, SweepCache first flushes dirty cachelines to the buffer, allowing the next region to start with a clean cache, and then moves all buffered cachelines to the corresponding NVM locations. In this way, no matter when power failure occurs, the buffer contents or their memory locations always remain intact, which serves as a basis for correct recovery. To hide the persistence delay, SweepCache speculatively starts a region right after the prior region finishes its execution-as if its stores were already persisted-with the two regions having their own persist buffer, i.e., dual-buffering. This region-level parallelism helps SweepCache to achieve the full potential of a high-performance data cache. The experimental results show that compared to the original cachefree nonvolatile processor, SweepCache delivers speedups of 14.60x and 14.86x-outperforming the state-of-the-art work by 3.47x and 3.49x-for two representative energy harvesting power traces, respectively.

AB Crowdsourcing is the learning paradigm that aims to combine noisy labels provided by a crowd of human annotators. To facilitate this label fusion, most contemporary crowdsourcing methods assume conditional independence between different annotators. Nevertheless, in many cases this assumption may not hold. This work investigates the effects of groups of correlated annotators in multiclass crowdsourced classification. To deal with this setup, a novel approach is developed to identify groups of dependent annotators via second-order moments of annotator responses. This in turn, enables appropriate dependence aware aggregation of annotator responses. Preliminary tests on synthetic and real data showcase the potential of the proposed approach.

AB Cloud occlusion is a common problem in the field of remote sensing, particularly for retrieving Land Surface Temperature (LST). Remote sensing thermal instruments onboard operational satellites are supposed to enable frequent and high-resolution observations over land; unfortunately, clouds adversely affect thermal signals by blocking outgoing longwave radiation emission from the Earth's surface, interfering with the retrieved ground emission temperature. Such cloud contamination severely reduces the set of serviceable LST images for downstream applications, making it impractical to perform intricate time-series analysis of LST. In this paper, we introduce a novel method to remove cloud occlusions from Landsat 8 LST images. We call our method ISLAND, an acronym for Interpolating Land Surface Temperature using land cover. Our approach uses LST images from Landsat 8 (at 30 m resolution with 16-day revisit cycles) and the NLCD land cover dataset. Inspired by Tobler's first law of Geography, ISLAND predicts occluded LST through a set of spatio-temporal filters that perform distance-weighted spatiotemporal interpolation. A critical feature of ISLAND is that the filters are land cover-class aware, making it particularly advantageous in complex urban settings with heterogeneous land cover types and distributions. Through qualitative and quantitative analysis, we show that ISLAND achieves robust reconstruction performance across a variety of cloud occlusion and surface land cover conditions, and with a high spatio-temporal resolution. We provide a public dataset of 20 U.S. cities with pre-computed ISLAND LST outputs. Using several case studies, we demonstrate that ISLAND opens the door to a multitude of high-impact urban and environmental applications across the continental United States.

AB Recently, Manolescu-Sarkar constructed a stable homotopy-type for link Floer homology, which uses grid homology and accounts for all domains that do not pass through a specific square. In doing so, they produced an obstruction chain complex of the grid diagram with that square removed. We define the obstruction chain complex of the full grid, without the square removed, and compute its homology. Though this homology is too complicated to immediately extend the Manolescu-Sarkar construction, we give results about the existence of sign assignments in grid homology.

SO SCIENCE ADVANCES

DT Article
AB Mechanical computing encodes information in deformed states of mechanical systems, such as multistable structures. However, achieving stable mechanical memory in most multistable systems remains challenging and often limited to binary information. Here, we report leveraging coupling kinematic bifurcation in rigid cube-based mechanisms with elasticity to create transformable, multistable mechanical computing metastructures with stable, high-density mechanical memory. Simply stretching the planar metastructure forms a multistable corrugated platform. It allows for independent mechanical or magnetic actuation of individual bistable element, serving as pop-up voxels for display or binary units for various tasks such as information writing, erasing, reading, encryption, and mechanologic computing. Releasing the pre-stretched strain stabilizes the prescribed information, resistant to external mechanical or magnetic perturbations, whereas re-stretching enables editable mechanical memory, akin to selective zones or disk formatting for information erasure and rewriting. Moreover, the platform can be reprogrammed and transformed into a multilayer configuration to achieve high-density memory.

AB This paper studies bandit problems where an agent has access to offline data that might be utilized to potentially improve the estimation of each arm's reward distribution. A major obstacle in this setting is the existence of compound biases from the observational data. Ignoring these biases and blindly fitting a model with the biased data could even negatively affect the online learning phase. In this work, we formulate this problem from a causal perspective. First, we categorize the biases into confounding bias and selection bias based on the causal structure they imply. Next, we extract the causal bound for each arm that is robust towards compound biases from biased observational data. The derived bounds contain the ground truth mean reward and can effectively guide the bandit agent to learn a nearly-optimal decision policy. We also conduct regret analysis in both contextual and non-contextual bandit settings and show that prior causal bounds could help consistently reduce the asymptotic regret.

AB We analyze the convergence properties of Fermat distances , a family of density-driven metrics defined on Riemannian manifolds with an associated probability measure. Fermat distances may be defined either on discrete samples from the underlying measure, in which case they are random, or in the continuum setting, where they are induced by geodesics under a density-distorted Riemannian metric. We prove that discrete, sample-based Fermat distances converge to their continuum analogues in small neighborhoods with a precise rate that depends on the intrinsic dimensionality of the data and the parameter governing the extent of density weighting in Fermat distances. This is done by leveraging novel geometric and statistical arguments in percolation theory that allow for non-uniform densities and curved domains. Our results are then used to prove that discrete graph Laplacians based on discrete, sample-driven Fermat distances converge to corresponding continuum operators. In particular, we show the discrete eigenvalues and eigenvectors converge to their continuum analogues at a dimension-dependent rate, which allows us to interpret the e fficacy of discrete spectral clustering using Fermat distances in terms of the resulting continuum limit. The perspective a fforded by our discrete-to-continuum Fermat distance analysis leads to new clustering algorithms for data and related insights into e fficient computations associated to density-driven spectral clustering. Our theoretical analysis is supported with numerical simulations and experiments on synthetic and real image data.

AB Prompted by findings of gender differences in learning game preferences and outcomes, education researchers have proposed adapting games by gender to foster learning and engagement. However, such recommendations typically rely on intuition, rather than empirical data, and are rooted in a binary representation of gender. On the other hand, recent evidence from several disciplines indicates that gender is best understood through multiple dimensions, including gender-typed occupational interests, activities, and traits. Our research seeks to provide learning game designers with empirical guidance incorporating this framework in developing digital learning games that are inclusive, equitable, and effective for all students. To this end, we conducted a survey study among 333 5th and 6th grade students in five urban and suburban schools in a mid-sized U.S. city, with the goal of investigating how game preferences differ by gender identity or gender-typed measures. Our findings uncovered consistent differences in game preferences from both a binary and multi-dimensional gender perspective, with gender-typed measures being more predictive of game preferences than binary gender identity. We also report on preference trends for different game genres and discuss their implications on learning game design. Ultimately, this work supports using multiple dimensions of gender to inform the customization of learning games that meet individual students' interests and preferences, instead of relying on vague gender stereotypes.

ID APPROXIMATION; MODELS
AB Graphons are general and powerful models for generating graphs of varying size. In this paper, we propose to directly model graphons using neural networks, obtaining Implicit Graphon Neural Representation (IGNR). Existing work in modeling and reconstructing graphons often approximates a target graphon by a fixed resolution piece-wise constant representation. Our IGNR has the benefit that it can represent graphons up to arbitrary resolutions, and enables natural and efficient generation of arbitrary sized graphs with desired structure once the model is learned. Furthermore, we allow the input graph data to be unaligned and have different sizes by leveraging the Gromov-Wasserstein distance. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of our model by showing its superior performance on a graphon learning task. We then propose an extension of IGNR that can be incorporated into an auto-encoder framework, and demonstrate its good performance under a more general setting of graphon learning. We also show that our model is suitable for graph representation learning and graph generation.

AB We consider the problem of designing distributed collision-avoidance multi-agent control in large-scale environments with potentially moving obstacles, where a large number of agents are required to maintain safety using only local information and reach their goals. This paper addresses the problem of collision avoidance, scalability, and generalizability by introducing graph control barrier functions (GCBFs) for distributed control. The newly introduced GCBF is based on the well-established CBF theory for safety guarantees but utilizes a graph structure for scalable and generalizable decentralized control. We use graph neural networks to learn both neural a GCBF certificate and distributed control. We also extend the framework from handling state-based models to directly taking point clouds from LiDAR for more practical robotics settings. We demonstrated the efficacy of GCBF in a variety of numerical experiments, where the number, density, and traveling distance of agents, as well as the number of unseen and uncontrolled obstacles increase. Empirical results show that GCBF outperforms leading methods such as MAPPO and multi-agent distributed CBF (MDCBF). Trained with only 16 agents, GCBF can achieve up to 3 times improvement of success rate (agents reach goals and never encountered in any collisions) on < 500 agents, and still maintain more than 50% success rates for > 1000 agents when other methods completely fail.(1)

AB The study presents the use of a novel on-lattice sampling approach to generate titanium oxynitride (TiNxOy) structures with potential applications in photovoltaic and water splitting. This approach presents a simple route to overcome challenges with structure-generating tools like Cluster Approach to Statistical Mechanics (CASM), and Ab initio Random Structure Search (AIRSS), CASM faces difficulty in generating ternary structures with large unit cells. With AIRSS, there is an increase in probability of sampling amorphous sample spaces with increased number of atoms in the unit cell. Here an on-lattice sampling approach was used to model the electronic structure of TiNxOy as a function of composition. We present results for Ti2N2O, Ti5N4O4 and Ti7N4O8, with 33 %, 50 % and 67 % N replaced by O via substitution relative to titanium nitride (TiN), respectively. Koopmans theorem was used correct the Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory (KS-DFT) bandgaps with corresponding values of 2.68 eV, 3.03 eV, and 3.65 eV for 33, 50 and 67 % O doping respectively. The projected density of states (PDOS) plot for TiN shows that the Fermi level is dominated by the 3d atomic orbitals of Ti, confirming pure TiN's metallicity. The valence bands of TiNxOy structures were dominated by 2p orbitals of O at lower energy levels, but they were dominated by 2p orbitals of N at energies close to the valence band maximum (VBM). The conduction bands were dominated by the 3d atomic orbitals of Ti, with the bandgap increasing with O composition leading to creation of shallow trap states near the VBM, which negatively impacts carrier mobility. In conclusion, the on-lattice sampling approach is an effective tool to generate highly crystalline structures of large unit cells, also keeping O substitution for N below 33 % as seen in Ti2N2O is crucial for avoiding shallow traps in TiNxOy structures.

AB Bismuth is a good constituent element for many quantum materials due to its large atomic number, 6s(2)6p(3) orbitals, and strong spin-orbital coupling. In this work, three new bismuthides, NdZn0.6Bi2, (La0.5Pr0.5)Zn0.6Bi2, and (La0.5Nd0.5)Zn0.6Bi2, were grown by a metal flux method, and their crystal structures were accurately determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. These new bismuthides belong to the RE-T-Pn(2) (RE = La-Lu, T = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, or Zn, and Pn = P, As, Sb, or Bi) family, are isostructural, and crystallize in the HfCuSi2 structure type. The bismuth elements have two possible oxidation states, Bi3- and Bi-, which were studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Two binding energy peaks of 155.91 and 161.23 eV were observed for Bi atoms within NdZn0.6Bi2, and similar binding energy peaks were detected in NdBi and LiBi. XPS also confirmed the trivalent nature of Nd, which was further verified by magnetic measurements. Additionally, magnetic measurements revealed that NdZn0.6Bi2 exhibits an antiferromagnetic transition around 3 K, while the mixed-cation compounds do not show any magnetic transition down to 2 K. Electronic transport measurements reveal weak magnetoresistance in all three compounds, with a maximum value of similar to 25% at 2 K and 9 T for (La0.5Nd0.5)Zn0.6Bi2.

AB Designing stabilizing controllers is a fundamental challenge in autonomous systems, particularly for high-dimensional, nonlinear systems that can hardly be accurately modeled with differential equations. The Lyapunov theory offers a solution for stabilizing control systems, still, current methods relying on Lyapunov functions require access to complete dynamics or samples of system executions throughout the entire state space. Consequently, they are impractical for high-dimensional systems. This paper introduces a novel framework, LYapunov-Guided Exploration (LYGE), for learning stabilizing controllers tailored to high-dimensional, unknown systems. LYGE employs Lyapunov theory to iteratively guide the search for samples during exploration while simultaneously learning the local system dynamics, control policy, and Lyapunov functions. We demonstrate its scalability on highly complex systems, including a high-fidelity F-16 jet model featuring a 16D state space and a 4D input space. Experiments indicate that, compared to prior works in reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and neural certificates, LYGE reduces the distance to the goal by 50% while requiring only 5% to 32% of the samples. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our algorithm can be extended to learn controllers guided by other certificate functions for unknown systems.

AB In the realm of large language models (LLMs) like the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), the Mixture of Experts (MoE) paradigm has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing model expressiveness and accuracy. However, the deployment of GPT MoE models for parallel inference on distributed systems presents significant challenges, primarily due to the extensive Alltoall communication required for expert routing and aggregation. This communication bottleneck exacerbates the already complex computational landscape, hindering the efficient utilization of high-performance computing resources. In this paper, we propose a lightweight optimization technique called ExFlow, to largely accelerate the inference of these MoE models. We take a new perspective on alleviating the communication overhead by exploiting the inter-layer expert affinity. Unlike previous methods, our solution can be directly applied to pre-trained MoE models without any fine-tuning or accuracy degradation. By proposing a context-coherent expert parallelism on distributed systems, our ExFlow design only uses one Alltoall communication to deliver the same functionality while previous methods all require two Alltoalls. By carefully examining the conditional probability in tokens' routing across multiple layers, we proved that pre-trained GPT MoE models implicitly exhibit a strong inter-layer expert affinity. We then design an efficient integer programming model to precisely capture such features and show that by properly placing the experts on corresponding GPUs, we can reduce up to 67% of tokens' cross-GPU routing latency on various hardware configurations and topologies. Our solution beats the cutting-edge Deepspeed-MoE in GPT MoE models with experts from 8 to 64, with up to 2.2x improvement in inference throughput. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work in leveraging inter-layer expert affinity to accelerate the inference of GPT MoE models. We further provide a detailed study of how the model implicitly acquires this expert affinity at the very early training stage and how this affinity evolves and stabilizes during training.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB The Message Passing Interface is the de facto standard in high-performance computing (IIPC) for inter-process communication. MPI libraries employ numerous algorithms tior each collective communication pattern whose behavior is largely affected by the underlying hardware, communication pattern, message size, and number of processes involved. Choosing the "best" algorithm for every possible scenario is a non-trivial task. MPI libraries primarily depend on heuristics for algorithm selection on previously unseen clusters, often resulting in evident slowdowns. Although offline micro-benchmarking tools can exhaustively identify optimal algorithms for all configurations, this is an excessively time-consuming approach. Machine Learning (ML) emerged as an alternate approach. However, most ML-based approaches employ online methods that introduce additional runtime overhead, which makes this impractical at scale. To address this challenge, we propose a pre-trained ML framework that eliminates runtime overhead. Our model requires only a quick inference for each new cluster without necessitating model retraining. It incorporates various hardware features to enhance its adaptability across diverse clusters. Our model's training utilizes tuning data from a broad range of architectures, promoting its versatility and our proposed system exhibits up to 6.3% speedup over default heuristics on systems of up to 1024 cores while significantly minimizing model overhead in comparison to existing methodologies.

AB As car ownership and urbanization continue to rise worldwide, traffic crashes have become growing concerns globally. Measuring crash risk provides insight into understanding crash patterns, which can eventually support proactive transport planning and improve road safety. However, traditional spatial analysis methods for crash risk assessment, such as the hotspot detection method, are mainly focused on identifying areas with higher crash frequency. These methods are subject to critical issues in risk analysis due to ignoring crash impacts and background traffic volume information. Aside from the two issues, current crash risk assessment methods, especially those aiming for cluster detection, are subject to the modified temporal unit problem, referring to the temporal effects (i.e., aggregation, segmentation, and boundary) in cluster detection. To alleviate these issues, this paper applies an emerging hot spot detection method, called the prospective space-time scan statistic (STSS) method, for assessing the crash risk at a refined network scale and over multiple years in a case study of Hartford, Connecticut. By identifying the spatial and temporal clusters of the crash risk, the study can provide evidence for tailoring road safety management strategies in neighborhoods characterized by high crash risk.

AB The solar power plant is a large-scale photovoltaic (PV) system aimed to generate solar power for the electricity grid. It includes PV arrays (PVAs), cables, and other electrical accessories. Moreover, the solar power plant builder must consider various parameters and design regulations. The cable routing problem (CRP) is critical in large-scale solar power plant design. The objective of our CRP is to minimize the installation cost of the cable by determining the partition of the photovoltaic array and the cable routing. In this study, we use the quantum computer to solve the CRP, an NP-hard integer linear programming (ILP) problem, and show its advantages over classic computers. We transfer the ILP CRP into the quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) model and solve it by the advanced quantum annealer. Finally, we analyze the computational results and discuss the advantages of our approach to solving the CRP.

AB Message passing graph neural networks (GNNs) are a popular learning architectures for graph-structured data. However, one problem GNNs experience is oversquashing, where a GNN has difficulty sending information between distant nodes. Understanding and mitigating oversquashing has recently received significant attention from the research community. In this paper, we continue this line of work by analyzing oversquashing through the lens of the effective resistance between nodes in the input graph. Effective resistance intuitively captures the "strength" of connection between two nodes by paths in the graph, and has a rich literature spanning many areas of graph theory. We propose to use total effective resistance as a bound of the total amount of oversquashing in a graph and provide theoretical justification for its use. We further develop an algorithm to identify edges to be added to an input graph to minimize the total effective resistance, thereby alleviating oversquashing. We provide empirical evidence of the effectiveness of our total effective resistance based rewiring strategies for improving the performance of GNNs.

AB Current causal inference approaches for estimating conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) often prioritize accuracy. However, in resource constrained settings, decision makers may only need a ranking of individuals based on their estimated CATE. In these scenarios, exact CATE estimation may be an unnecessarily challenging task, particularly when the underlying function is difficult to learn. In this work, we study the relationship between CATE estimation and optimizing for CATE ranking, demonstrating that optimizing for ranking may be more appropriate than optimizing for accuracy in certain settings. Guided by our analysis, we propose an approach to directly optimize for rankings of individuals to inform treatment assignment that aims to maximize benefit. Our tree-based approach maximizes the expected benefit of the treatment assignment using a novel splitting criteria. In an empirical case-study across synthetic datasets, our approach leads to better treatment assignments compared to CATE estimation methods as measured by expected total benefit. By providing a practical and efficient approach to learning a CATE ranking, this work offers an important step towards bridging the gap between CATE estimation techniques and their downstream applications.

AB Teleoperation, such as remote driving, is considered as a key use case of 5G and Next-Generation (NextG) networks. In this context, robots, autonomous vehicles, or other autonomous agents transmit sensor data over mobile networks to edge or cloud servers, where AI systems collaborate with human operators to provide situational awareness and enable remote control. In the case of teleoperated driving, vehicles are equipped with an array of cameras and LiDAR devices, which can generate 100s Mbps (megabits per second) of data. As shown in existing measurement studies, such data volumes far exceed the uplink capacity of currently deployed 5G networks, especially when multiple vehicles compete for radio resources. Data compression is thus imperative. In this paper, we explore the impact of sensor data compression on the performance of downstream AI tasks running in edge/cloud servers, which are crucial to alert human operators for safe teleoperation. Using object recognition and semantic segmentation as two example AI tasks, we study how data compression affects the performance of these two AI tasks using unimodal (video or LiDAR) and multi-modal (video+LiDAR) data. We find that lossy data compression generally decreases the performance of AI tasks. The performances of these AI tasks exhibit differing degrees of sensitivity based on the types of data sources and levels of compression. We also empirically identify an optimal trade-off point for the multi-modal vision tasks.

TI Operational prediction of solar flares using a transformer-based
   framework
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
AB Solar flares are explosions on the Sun. They happen when energy stored in magnetic fields around solar active regions (ARs) is suddenly released. Solar flares and accompanied coronal mass ejections are sources of space weather, which negatively affects a variety of technologies at or near Earth, ranging from blocking high-frequency radio waves used for radio communication to degrading power grid operations. Monitoring and providing early and accurate prediction of solar flares is therefore crucial for preparedness and disaster risk management. In this article, we present a transformer based framework, named SolarFlareNet, for predicting whether an AR would produce a ?-class flare within the next 24 to 72 h. We consider three ? classes, namely the =M5.0 class, the =M class and the =C class, and build three transformers separately, each corresponding to a ? class. Each transformer is used to make predictions of its corresponding ?-class flares. The crux of our approach is to model data samples in an AR as time series and to use transformers to capture the temporal dynamics of the data samples. Each data sample consists of magnetic parameters taken from Space-weather HMI Active Region Patches (SHARP) and related data products. We survey flare events that occurred from May 2010 to December 2022 using the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite X-ray flare catalogs provided by the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), and build a database of flares with identified ARs in the NCEI flare catalogs. This flare database is used to construct labels of the data samples suitable for machine learning. We further extend the deterministic approach to a calibration-based probabilistic forecasting method. The SolarFlareNet system is fully operational and is capable of making near real-time predictions of solar flares on the Web.

DE Memory EMR; Covert Communication; Parallelism; DRAM
AB Memory Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR) allows attackers to manipulate the DRAM of infiltrated systems to leak sensitive secret information. Although most of the existing works have demonstrated its feasibility, practical concerns, such as the ideal electromagnetic environment and stationary attacking layout, make the covert channel attack less convincing, especially in vulnerable sites such as offices and data centers. This work removes the above impractical assumptions to uncover the potential of memory EMR by proposing the first parallel EMR covert communication protocol. Our design reshapes the current "1-to-1" covert communication mode to "n-to-1" mode via a novel pattern-based 2-dimensional symbol encoding scheme, allowing multiple victim computers to simultaneously perform data exfiltration to one attacker (the receiver) without mutual interference. Meanwhile, this novel scheme design also enables the very first mobile attacker, i.e., a smartphone connected to a software-defined radio (SDR) dongle, to capture parallel memory EMR signals in a volatile environment. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the performance in a volatile environment with different parameter configurations, distances, motion modes, shielding materials, orientations, hardware configurations, and SDR platforms. Our experimental results demonstrate that FreeEM can support up to 4 parallel memory EMR transmissions to achieve an overall throughput of 625Kbps and a decoding accuracy of 96.88%. The maximum communication distance can reach up to 20 meters.

AB Current license plate recognition systems struggle with image noise reduction and license plate feature detecting processes. This paper presents an efficient and highly accurate license plate detection and character detection program based on the YOLO neural network, which is a simplified CNN-based neural network frame for robust image processing systems. Different than most approaches, the system we proposed simply requires a prioritized analysis of the dataset in order to evaluate potential noises inside images so that program implementations could be more effective and more targeted to design and optimize with YOLO neural network. With our presented system, the accuracy of license plate detection improves from 63% which is performed by traditional image processing methods to 90.3%.

TI Breaking and trapping Cooper pairs by Rydberg-molecule spectroscopy in
   atomic Fermi superfluids
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
LA English
DT Article
AB We propose a spectroscopic probe of the breaking and localization of Cooper pairs in an atomic Fermi super- fluid interacting with a Rydberg impurity. This is achieved by monitoring the formation of diatomic and triatomic ultralong-range molecular species in the superfluid across the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)-Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) crossover. The triatomic Rydberg molecule in the BEC regime heralds the trapping of a tightly bound Cooper pair, reminiscent of pion capture in nuclear matter, while the breaking of a Cooper pair on the BCS side by a diatomic Rydberg molecule is evocative of binary-star tidal disruption by a black hole. Spectroscopy of the Fermi superfluid and Rydberg molecules allows for an estimation of the Cooper-pair size while the Rydberg molecule binding energies discern many-body pairing effects.

AB As the aging and disabled populations grow, the demand for effective assistance in daily activities such as sit-to-stand (STS) has been increasing. Wearable exoskeletons are a promising technology for reducing the effort required for STS. This study explores the sensor fusion of electroencephalography (EEG) signals, which reveal pre-movement intentions, with inertial measurement unit (IMU) data, offering real-time motion information for enhanced knee exoskeleton control in STS assistance. The EEG-IMU sensor fusion approach improves the temporal accuracy and robustness of STS intention detection. By detecting STS intentions with lower latencies, the knee exoskeleton provides timely and smooth support, enhancing the user experience. The proposed method reduces system latency, enabling rapid user-exoskeleton interaction. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the brain-computer interface (BCI)-enhanced knee exoskeleton for improving STS efficiency and user experience.

   Learning; Distributed Training
AB Data Parallelism (DP), Tensor Parallelism (TP), and Pipeline Parallelism (PP) are the three strategies widely adopted to enable fast and efficient Large Language Model (LLM) training. However, these approaches rely on data-intensive communication routines to collect, aggregate, and re-distribute gradients, activations, and other important model information, which pose significant overhead. Co-designed with GPU-based compression libraries, MPI libraries have been proven to reduce message size significantly, and leverage interconnect bandwidth, thus increasing training efficiency while maintaining acceptable accuracy.
   In this work, we investigate the efficacy of compression-assisted MPI collectives under the context of distributed LLM training using 3D parallelism and ZeRO optimizations. We scaled up to 192 V100 GPUs on the Lassen supercomputer. First, we enabled a naive compression scheme across all collectives and observed a 22.5% increase in TFLOPS per GPU and a 23.6% increase in samples per second for GPT-NeoX-20B training. Nonetheless, such a strategy ignores the sparsity discrepancy among messages communicated in each parallelism degree, thus introducing more errors and causing degradation in training loss. Therefore, we incorporated hybrid compression settings toward each parallel dimension and adjusted the compression intensity accordingly. Given their low-rank structure [1], we apply aggressive compression on gradients when performing DP All-reduce. We adopt milder compression to preserve precision while communicating activations, optimizer states, and model parameters in TP and PP. Using the adjusted hybrid compression scheme, we demonstrate a 17.3% increase in TFLOPS per GPU and a 12.7% increase in samples per second while reaching baseline loss convergence. *

AB Modern multi/many-core processors in HPC systems have hundreds of cores with deep memory hierarchies. HPC applications run at high core counts often experience contention between processes/threads on shared resources such as caches, leading to degraded performance. This is especially true for dense collective patterns, such as MPI_Alltoall, that have many concurrent memory transactions. The ordering of memory copies during the MPI_Alltoall operation can significantly affect performance as cache-efficient access patterns could potentially reduce cache misses. However, the correct access pattern depends on various factors, including cache associativity, cache sizes, coherence protocols, and memory layouts. This paper first identifies sources of bottlenecks in performing memory operations in an Alltoall. We propose different orderings for the memory copies in Alltoall operations and study their effectiveness for various message sizes. We overcome bandwidth bottlenecks related to repeated bus requests in the cache by proposing a hybrid memory copy scheme that combines regular temporal and non-temporal stores. Then, we implement an Alltoall algorithm that dynamically picks between memory orders based on their performance for different message sizes/number of processes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that explores a combination of dynamic memory copy orders and non-temporal instructions for optimizing MPI_Alltoall operations. Our proposed solutions reduce the latency versus state-of-the-art solutions by up to 10x at the micro-benchmark level and 22.2% for the CPU time per loop in distributed Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) using P3DFFT.

AB Deep learning (DL) models based on the transformer architecture have revolutionized many DL applications such as large language models (LLMs), vision transformers, audio generation, and time series prediction. Much of this progress has been fueled by distributed training, yet distributed communication remains a substantial bottleneck to training progress. This paper examines the communication behavior of transformer models - that is, how different parallelism schemes used in multi-node/multi-GPU DL Training communicate data in the context of transformers. We use GPT-based language models as a case study of the transformer architecture due to their ubiquity. We validate the empirical results obtained from our communication logs using analytical models. At a high level, our analysis reveals a need to optimize small message point-to-point communication further, correlations between sequence length, per-GPU throughput, model size, and optimizations used, and where to potentially guide further optimizations in framework and HPC middleware design and optimization.

AB The cybersecurity workforce lacks diversity; the field is predominately men and White or Asian, with only 10% identifying as women, Latine, or Black. Previous studies identified access to supportive communities as a possible disparity between marginalized and non-marginalized cybersecurity professional populations and highlighted this support as a key to career success. We focus on these community experiences by conducting a survey of 342 cybersecurity professionals to identify differences in perceptions and experiences of belonging across demographic groups. Our results show a discrepancy between experiences for different gender identities, with women being more likely than men to report instances of harassment and encountering unsupportive environments because of their gender. Psychological safety was low across all demographic groups, meaning participants did not feel comfortable engaging with or speaking up in the community. Based on these result we provide recommendations to community leaders.

ID SAFETY
AB To safely navigate intricate real-world scenarios, autonomous vehicles (AVs) must be able to adapt to diverse road conditions and anticipate future events. World model (WM)-based reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach by learning and predicting the complex dynamics of various environments. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, there does not exist an open-source platform for training and testing such algorithms in complicated driving environments. To fill this void, we introduce CarDreamer, the first open-source learning platform designed specifically for developing and evaluating WM-based autonomous driving algorithms. It comprises a few key components, including 1) WM Backbone: CarDreamer has integrated some state-of-the-art WMs, which simplifies the reproduction of RL algorithms; 2) Built-In Tasks: CarDreamer offers a comprehensive set of highly configurable driving tasks which are compatible with gym interfaces and are equipped with empirically optimized reward functions; and 3) Task Development Suite: CarDreamer integrates a flexible task development suite to streamline the creation of driving tasks. This suite enables easy definition of traffic flows and vehicle routes, along with automatic collection of multimodal observation data. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments using built-in tasks to evaluate the performance and potential of WMs in autonomous driving. Thanks to the richness and flexibility of CarDreamer, we also systematically study the impact of observation modality, observability, and sharing of vehicle intentions on AV safety and efficiency. All code and documents are accessible on our GitHub page https://github.com/ucd-dare/CarDreamer.

AB This study focuses on the construction of small-scale atomistic representations of three Appalachian coals of different ranks- high volatile bituminous, low volatile bituminous, and semi-anthracite. Ultimate, proximate, 13C NMR, FTIR, and XPS data were used to infer 2D and construct multiple 3D molecular models for each coal. A new simulation strategy for structure optimization, termed "Sectioned Optimization", is introduced to ensure energetically stable configurations of the 3D coal models. Density functional methods are applied to the models, improving their quality, and giving insight into the limitations of empirical simulations in this complex system. The structural models were validated ex post facto using a density functional code, VASP. We describe the distribution of local atomic environments in the models to emphasize the significant structural distinctions between the three coal ranks. We also report the first ab initio vibrational density of states calculations for coal and compare it to FTIR and Inelastic Neutron Scattering experiments and identify vibrational modes using ab initio calculations. We also provide animations of the vibrational normal modes in coal that are consistent with FTIR band assignments. We show that the specific heat capacity compares favorably with experimental data.

AB Herein, we investigate the electroluminescent properties of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on a carbazole derivative 2,3,5,6-tetrakis(3,6-diphenyl-9H-carbazol-9-yl)-1,4-benzenedicarbonitrile (4CzTPN-Ph) with red emission. Two types of OLEDs were fabricated using this emitter: the first employed a host-guest system, while the second utilized a light-emitting structure with a triple cascade of quantum wells. In the second OLED, an ultrathin 4CzTPN-Ph emitter layer with 5 nm thickness was placed between the layers of 3,3'-di(9H-carbazol-9-yl)-1,1'-biphenyl (mCBP) and diphenyl[4-(triphenylsilyl)phenyl]phosphine oxide (TSPO1) forming the first well, and between the same type of TSPO1 layers in the second and third quantum wells. This configuration made it possible to create optimal energy barriers at the interfaces to scatter charge carriers and excitons within each well efficiently. This configuration also contributed to expanding the carrier recombination zone and reducing the exciton quenching probability. Discrete energy levels for electrons and holes in the quantum wells were calculated by solving the stationary Schrodinger equation in the frequency domain. The calculations showed the localization of electrons and holes in the corresponding quantum wells. A comparative analysis of the efficiency of OLED devices (brightness, power efficiency, and current efficiency) showed that in the first type of OLED, efficient energy transfer to the 4CzTPN-Ph emitter was achieved due to the relatively broad spectral overlap between the emission spectrum of the host component (mCBP) and the absorption spectrum of the 4CzTPN-Ph emitter. As a result, the OLED with the host-guest system achieved an external quantum efficiency of 2% at a maximum brightness of more than 1000 cd/m(2). While the second type of device demonstrated slightly lower efficiency, the advantage of the quantum wells cascade structure lies in its narrow quantum wells (5 nm), which result in a characteristic narrowing of the electroluminescence spectra. This produces spectrally purer red emission with International Commission on Illumination (CIE) coordinates of (0.58, 0.33), compared to the broader spectrum of the doped OLED with CIE coordinates of (0.51, 0.38). This approach effectively solves the problem of red-to-blue spectrum shift inherent in OLED with a host-guest system.

AB The advancement of machine learning technologies has revolutionized the search and optimization of material properties. These algorithms often rely on theoretical calculations, such as density functional theory (DFT), for data inputs and validation, which are not always effective for uranium-based materials due to their strong electron correlations. This study presents a computationally inexpensive machine learning approach, specifically a random forest classifier, to predict the magnetic ground states of uranium compounds using only structural inputs. Our model, trained on a curated dataset of experimentally verified magnetic orders, achieves a mean accuracy of 60.2%, significantly outperforming random chance. Through a purely structural descriptor, our method offers a reliable alternative for discovering new materials with desirable magnetic properties, addressing the challenges posed by strong correlations in quantum materials.

AB Excessive warming is the source of many environmental challenges in urban areas. Finding causal interactions between urban ambient temperature and other meteorological variables will greatly facilitate our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of urban heat. In this study, we use the data of 2-m air temperature and 500 hPa geopotential height (GPH) in 520 cities in the contiguous United States (CONUS), from 2016 to 2022, to detect their local and nonlocal causal interactions based on the convergent cross-mapping method. For local (within the same city) interactions between temperature and GPH, there are hubs of strong causal interactions in the northern Appalachian Mountain and inland southwestern CONUS, whereas the leeward side of the southern Rocky Mountains exhibit low causation due to the baroclinic in this area. The nonlocal causal networks exhibit potential long-range connections (teleconnections), largely attributable to the influence of the upstream and downstream westerly circulations on local atmospheric variables. This study can be informative to stakeholders in design sustainable countermeasures to mitigate excessive heat in urban areas.

AB We report a systematic investigation of anisotropic magnetocaloric effects in a crystalline, monoclinic Cr3Te4 sample grown by the chemical vapor transport (CVT) method. The maximum magnetic entropy change -Delta S-M(max) is 3.31 J kg(-1) K-1 for the c axis (3.16 J kg(-1) K-1 for the ab-plane) and the relative cooling power (RCP) is 340 J kg(-1) for the c axis (350 J kg(-1) for the ab-plane) near the Curie temperature with a magnetic field (mu H-0) change of 9 T. With the scaling analysis of Delta S-M, all rescaled Delta S-M(T, H) curves collapse onto a single universal curve, indicating a second-order magnetic phase transition in Cr3Te4. Furthermore, -Delta S-M(max) follows the power law of H-n with n = 0.656 +/- 0.005. The RCP and delta TFWHM have H(c )and H-b dependence on field, with c = 1.179 +/- 0.011 and b = 0.498 +/- 0.005, respectively, which led us to estimate the critical exponents of beta = 0.359 +/- 0.013, gamma = 1.646 +/- 0.057, and delta = 5.578 +/- 0.190.

TI Third quantization with Hartree approximation for open-system bosonic
   transport
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
LA English
DT Article
ID QUANTUM; PHASE; DYNAMICS
AB The third quantization (3rd Q) for bosons provides the exact steady-state solution of the Lindblad equation with quadratic Hamiltonians. By decomposing the interaction of the Bose-Hubbard model (BHM) according to Hartree approximation, we present a self-consistent formalism for solving the open-system bosonic Lindblad equation with weak interactions in the steady state. The 3rd Q with Hartree approximation takes into account the infinite Fock space of bosons, while its demand of resource scales polynomially with the system size. We examine the method by analyzing three examples of the BHM, including the uniform chain, interaction-induced diode effect, and Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Hubbard model. When compared with the simulations with capped boson numbers for small systems, the 3rd Q with Hartree approximation captures the qualitative behavior and suggests an upper bound of the steady-state value. Finite-size scaling confirms the results from the 3rd Q with Hartree approximation converging towards the thermodynamic limit. Thus, the manageable method allows us to characterize and predict large-system behavior of quantum transport in interacting bosonic systems relevant to cold-atom experiments.

ID SYSTEMS
AB Policy decomposition is a novel framework for approximating optimal control policies of complex dynamical systems with a hierarchy of policies derived from smaller but tractable subsystems. It stands out amongst the class of hierarchical control methods by estimating a priori how well the closed-loop behavior of different control hierarchies matches the optimal policy. However, the number of possible hierarchies grows prohibitively with the number of inputs and the dimension of the state-space of the system making it unrealistic to estimate the closed-loop performance for all hierarchies. Here, we present the development of two search methods based on Genetic Algorithm and Monte-Carlo Tree Search to tackle this combinatorial challenge, and demonstrate that it is indeed surmountable. We showcase the efficacy of our search methods and the generality of the framework by applying it towards finding hierarchies for control of three distinct robotic systems: a simplified biped, a planar manipulator, and a quadcopter. The discovered hierarchies, in comparison to heuristically designed ones, provide improved closed-loop performance or can be computed in minimal time with marginally worse control performance, and also exceed the control performance of policies obtained with popular deep reinforcement learning methods.

AB The nature of dark matter remains one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in elementary particle physics. It might well be that the dark matter particle belongs to a dark sector completely secluded or extremely weakly coupled to the visible sector. We demonstrate that gravitational waves arising from first-order phase transitions in the early Universe can be used to look for signatures of dark sector models connected to neutron physics. This introduces a new connection between gravitational-wave physics and nuclear physics experiments. Focusing on two particular extensions of the Standard Model with dark U(1) and SU(2) gauge groups constructed to address the neutron lifetime puzzle, we show how those signatures can be searched for in future gravitational-wave and astrometry experiments.

AB Energy prices are usually determined by the marginal costs obtained by solving economic dispatch problems without considering commitment costs. Hence, generating units are compensated through uplift payments. However, uplift payments may undermine market transparency as they are not publicly disclosed. Alternatively, energy prices can be obtained from the unit commitment problem which considers commitment costs. But, due to non-convexity, prices may not monotonically increase with demand. To resolve this issue, convex hull pricing has been introduced. It is defined as the slope of the convex envelope of the total cost function over the convex hull of a unit commitment (UC) problem. Although several approaches have been developed, a relevant survey has not been found to aid the understanding of convex hull pricing from the current limited literature. This paper provides a systematic survey of convex hull pricing. It reviews, compares, and links various existing approaches, focusing on the modeling and computation of convex hull prices. Furthermore, this paper explores potential areas of improvement and future challenges due to the ongoing efforts for power system decarbonization.

AB Metal complexes with t-Bu-substituted allyl ligands are relatively rare, especially compared to their conceptually similar trimethylsilyl-substituted analogs. The scarcity partially stems from the few general synthetic entry points for the t-Bu versions. This situation was studied through a modified synthesis for the allyl ligand itself and by forming several mono(allyl)nickel derivatives. After 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-hepten-3-one was converted to the related 5-bromo-2,2,6,6-tetramethylhept-3-ene (A(2t)Br), a mixture of Ni(COD)(2) and A(2t)Br in the presence of a neutral donor ligand such as MeCN was found to produce the dark red dimeric pi-allyl complex [{A(2t)NiBr}(2)]. Both NMR and X-ray crystallographic data confirmed that the t-Bu substituents are in a syn, syn-conformation, like that in the previously described [{A ' NiBr}(2)] (A ' = 1,3-(TMS)(2)C3H3) complex. [{A(2t)NiBr}(2)] will form adducts with neutral donors such as PPh3 and IMes (IMes = 1,3-dimesitylimidazol-2-ylidene), but the resulting [A(2t)Ni(PPh3)Br] complex is not as stable as its trimethylsilyl analog. The [A(2t)Ni(IMes)Br] complex crystallizes from hexanes as a monomer, with an eta(3)-coordinated [A(2t)] ligand, and in contrast to the starting arrangement in [{A(2t)NiBr}(2)], the t-Bu groups on the A(2t) ligand are in a syn, anti-relationship. This structure is paralleled in the trimethylsilyl analog [A ' Ni(IMes)Br]. DFT calculations were used to compare the structures of t-Bu- and related trimethylsilyl-substituted complexes.

AB As engineering educators attempt to develop solutions to increase student retention and graduation rates and decrease student departures from their majors during the first two years of study, findings from a summer bridge program at a large minority-serving institution (MSI) show promise for practices that could potentially help to mitigate these issues. Summer bridge strategies have been shown to be effective in assisting in college students' transition from first to sophomore year. This study comprises a case study of a chemical engineering summer bridge program in which undergraduate peer facilitators introduced sophomore-level chemical engineering material and energy balance course material to their peers. The goal of this study was to understand the types of discourse methods used during problem-solving sessions by peer facilitators and how students' learning experiences were impacted. Data for this study were collected via video observations and a post-program open-ended survey. Authors found that peer facilitators created an environment where students felt encouraged and supported and could relate to facilitators and course materials in new ways. This work further illustrates promising practices of using peer facilitators that need further attention, along with the potential for how engagement and learning could be enhanced by the more formal preparation of peer facilitators.

DE Reinforcement Learning; Deep Q-Network; Epsilon-greedy; malicious URLs
AB Web applications are the most popular and critical applications for the Internet, but attackers also utilize web browsers for malicious purposes. Uniform Resource Locator(URL) has been utilized to launch attacks on users, systems, and networks in different ways, such as phishing, defacement, malware, and spam. Identifying malicious URLs is the fundamental task to protect our digital assets. This paper presents a new malicious link detection system based on reinforcement learning to identify malicious URLs. It utilizes a Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm to make intelligent determinations by an agent in the designated environment. This paper analyzes malicious URL datasets with various feature sets with the DQN algorithm and provides a strategy to optimize the detection rates. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of preventing malicious URLs in different settings.

AB In recent years, computing has been moving rapidly from the centralized cloud to various edges. For instance, electric vehicles (EVs), one of the next-generation computing platforms, have grown in popularity as a sustainable alternative to conventional vehicles. Compared with traditional ones, EVs have many unique advantages, such as less environmental pollution, high energy utilization efficiency, simple structure, and convenient maintenance etc. Meanwhile, it is also currently facing lots of challenges, including short cruising range, long charging time, inadequate supporting facilities, cyber security risks, etc. Nevertheless, electric vehicles are still developing as a future industry, and the number of users keeps growing, with governments and companies around the world continuously investing in promoting EV-related supply chains. As an emerging and important computing platform, we comprehensively study electric vehicular systems and state-of-the-art EV-related technologies. Specifically, this paper outlines electric vehicles' history, major architecture and components in hardware and software, current state-of-the-art technologies, and anticipated future developments to reduce drawbacks and difficulties.

AB We propose to search for a new type of gravitational wave signature relevant for particle physics models with symmetries broken at vastly different energy scales. The spectrum contains a characteristic doublepeak structure consisting of a sharp peak from domain walls and a smooth bump from a first order phase transition in the early universe. We demonstrate how such a gravitational wave signal arises in a new theory unifying baryon number and color into an SU(4) gauge group broken at the multi-TeV scale, and with the lepton number promoted to an SU(2) gauge symmetry broken at the multi-EeV scale. The model contains two types of dark matter particles, explains the observed domination of matter over antimatter in the Universe, and accommodates nonzero neutrino masses. We discuss how future gravitational wave can be utilized to look for this novel signature.

AB With growing interdependence among various energy forms, such as electricity, heat, and cooling, multi-energy system (MES) is playing an increasingly important role. As a focal point in MES, energy hub (EH) needs to be properly planned for increased efficiency of energy utilization. This paper presents a generic mixed-integer linear model for EH planning to minimize the overall investment and operation cost given the demand and price of each energy. Our approach uses a graph with multiple rows and layers to represent the energy conversion topology in an EH. In this work, we formulate the EH optimal planning problem with a single combined model to implement the following two steps: 1) optimize the device investments represented in system topology graph; 2) manage the energy conversion and flow to meet the end-use demands meanwhile minimizing the cost. The numerical study shows the efficacy of our proposed model.

AB Ensuring that computer science curricula connect to learners' home culture, interests, and lived experiences is one approach to making the field more equitable. A central feature of the Scratch Encore Curriculum is to provide many opportunities for learners to plan and implement open-ended programming projects that invite them to draw on their prior knowledge, experiences, and cultural resources. To date, relatively little research has been done to analyze how learners respond to such curricular invitations, specifically with respect to what aspects of themselves and their interests they choose to express in their resulting projects.
   In this work, we investigate what people, places, interests, and experiences learners draw from as they plan and program open-ended Scratch projects. We analyzed the planning documents and final projects of 101 4th-7th grade (9-13 years) learners from the first two modules of our curriculum. The results show that when given the chance, learners incorporate aspects (such as Home and Family, and Hobbies and Leisure) of themselves into open-ended projects. Some learners drew from many areas of their lives while others focused on specific events, people, or interests. Our findings also indicate that the activities and Scratch are conducive to having learners of this age group express themselves, even early in the curriculum when they are still learning basic Scratch and CS concepts. This work contributes to our understanding of the impact of culturally responsive curricula and how it shapes the way learners engage with and express themselves in computing curricula.

AB We review the current scholarship on rural policing, punishment, crime, and reentry. We shift the focus from the "square of crime" to an expansive understanding of crime and punishment in rural communities that uses neighborhood effects to study inequality across places. A central focus of the article is an investigation of the prison boom or the tripling of prison facilities in the United States. Ultimately, the prison boom is largely a rural phenomenon. As such, we examine how prison building is a product of carceral capacity tied to rurality and race. By focusing on the neighborhood effect, we can theorize what contributes to, and mitigates, crime and punishment across rural communities. In building toward a theory of a rural neighborhood effect, we investigate context through understanding the role of spatial and racial stratification in shaping inequality across rural places.

AB Background: Engineering students experience high levels of distress and low rates of mental health treatment seeking, yet there is a gap in knowledge around how this compares with that of students in other fields of study. Given the influence of social identity (e.g., gender identity, race/ethnicity) on mental health and treatment seeking, it is important to account for sociodemographic variation across fields when performing such comparisons. Purpose: This study used Andersen's Behavioral Model to compare mental health distress and treatment use between students in engineering and other fields while controlling for sociodemographic factors. Methods: Survey data came from the 2021-2022 Healthy Minds Study (N > 50,000). Measures related to mental health, treatment use, and diagnosis were examined. Descriptive statistics were determined for each field of study, and regression analyses were used to assess differences across fields while accounting for covariates. Results: Compared to students from other fields, engineering students were among the least likely to report symptoms of depression and anxiety. However, 44.4% of undergraduate engineering students screened positive for current depression and/or anxiety. Of those who screened positive, only 40.4% had received therapy/counseling in the past year. Further, they were the least likely to have received a depression or anxiety diagnosis when compared to students from other fields. Conclusion: When controlling for sociodemographic factors, undergraduate engineering students reported lower rates of mental health distress and treatment use compared to students in other fields. This study highlights the need for considering engineering culture in the interpretation of student mental health and treatment.

AB Inanimate surfaces that are contaminated with infectious pathogens are common sources of spread for many communicable diseases. Understanding how ambient temperature alters the ability of pathogens to remain viable on these surfaces is critical for understanding how fomites can contribute to seasonal patterns of disease outbreaks. House finches (Haemorhous mexicanus) experience fall and winter outbreaks of mycoplasmal conjunctivitis, caused by the bacterial pathogen Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG). Although bird feeder surfaces serve as an indirect route of MG transmission between sick and healthy individuals, the contributions of feeders to MG transmission in the wild will depend on how ambient temperature affects viability and pathogenicity of MG on feeder surfaces over time. Here, we used two experiments, with identical initial design, to assess such temperature effects. For both experiments, we pipetted equal amounts of MG onto replicate feeder ports held at night-day temperatures representing summer (22-27 degrees C) or winter (4-9 degrees C). We allowed MG to incubate on feeders at either temperature and swabbed remaining inocula from surfaces at 0, 1, 2, 4, or 7 days post-inoculation of the feeder, with each replicate feeder port only swabbed at a single time point. In the first study, we analyzed swabs using a culture-based assay and found that MG incubated at colder versus warmer temperatures maintained higher viability on feeder surfaces over time. In the second study, we replicated the same experimental design but used MG swabs from feeder surfaces to inoculate wild-caught, pathogen-na & iuml;ve birds and measured resulting disease severity and pathogen loads to determine pathogenicity. We found that MG remained pathogenic on feeder surfaces at cold ambient temperatures for up to one week, much longer than previously documented. Further, MG was significantly more pathogenic when incubated on feeders in colder versus warmer temperatures, with the strongest effects of temperature present after at least four days of incubation on feeder surfaces. Overall, cold ambient temperatures appear to alter the role of fomites in the MG transmission process, and temperature likely contributes to seasonal disease dynamics in this system and many others.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate how the benefits described by undergraduate mentors in an afterschool STEM program for elementary students changed over time the longer they served as mentors in the program. We used the afterschool program as a case study and drew on interviews with 30 mentors who served between one and six semesters in the program between 2017 and 2022. We found that the mentors developed their competence, enhanced their autonomy, and built new relationships. How and the extent to which the mentors experienced these benefits shifted over time the longer they served. Our findings add to existing research on how mentors' experiences change over time and have implications for mentoring programs and how they support and retain mentors.

Elemental sulfur is another abundant yet underutilized commodity produced as a by-product resulting from the refining of fossil fuels. The current study presents a strategy for preparing five durable composites via a simple one-pot synthesis involving the reaction of lignin oil and elemental sulfur. These lignin oil-sulfur composites LOSx@T (where x = wt. % sulfur, ranging from 80 to 90, and T represents the reaction temperature in degrees C) were prepared via the reaction of elemental sulfur and lignin oil (LO) with elemental sulfur. The resulting composites could be remelted and reshaped several times without the loss of mechanical strength. Mechanical, thermal, and morphological studies showed that LOSx@T possesses properties competitive with some mechanical properties of commercial building materials, exhibiting favorable compressive strengths (22.1-35.9 MPa) and flexural strengths (5.7-6.5 MPa) exceeding the values required for many construction applications of ordinary Portland cement (OPC) and brick formulations. While varying the amount of organic material did not result in a notable difference in mechanical strength, increasing the reaction temperature from 230 to 300 degrees C resulted in a significant increase in compressive strength. The results reported herein reveal potential applications of both lignin and waste sulfur during the ongoing effort toward developing recyclable and sustainable building materials.

AB Melt pool dynamics in metal additive manufacturing (AM) is critical to process stability, microstructure formation, and final properties of the printed materials. Physics-based simulation, including computational fluid dynamics (CFD), is the dominant approach to predict melt pool dynamics. However, the physics-based simulation approaches suffer from the inherent issue of very high computational cost. This paper provides a physics-informed machine learning method by integrating the conventional neural networks with the governing physical laws to predict the melt pool dynamics, such as temperature, velocity, and pressure, without using any training data on velocity and pressure. This approach avoids solving the nonlinear Navier-Stokes equation numerically, which significantly reduces the computational cost (if including the cost of velocity data generation). The difficult-to-determine parameters' values of the governing equations can also be inferred through data-driven discovery. In addition, the physics-informed neural network (PINN) architecture has been optimized for efficient model training. The data-efficient PINN model is attributed to the extra penalty by incorporating governing PDEs, initial conditions, and boundary conditions in the PINN model.

ID RECOGNITION; MISSION
AB Image super-resolution is an important subject in image processing and recognition. Here, we present an attention-aided convolutional neural network for solar image super-resolution. Our method, named SolarCNN, aims to enhance the quality of line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms of solar active regions (ARs) collected by the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). The ground-truth labels used for training SolarCNN are the LOS magnetograms collected by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory. Solar ARs consist of strong magnetic fields in which magnetic energy can suddenly be released to produce extreme space-weather events, such as solar flares, coronal mass ejections, and solar energetic particles. SOHO/MDI covers Solar Cycle 23, which is stronger with more eruptive events than Cycle 24. Enhanced SOHO/MDI magnetograms allow for better understanding and forecasting of violent events of space weather. Experimental results show that SolarCNN improves the quality of SOHO/MDI magnetograms in terms of the structural similarity index measure, Pearson's correlation coefficient, and the peak signal-to-noise ratio.

AB As a new paradigm to erase data from a model and protect user privacy, machine unlearning has drawn significant attention. However, existing studies on machine unlearning mainly focus on its effectiveness and efficiency, neglecting the security challenges introduced by this technique. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap and study the possibility of conducting malicious attacks leveraging machine unlearning. Specifically, we consider the backdoor attack via machine unlearning, where an attacker seeks to inject a backdoor in the unlearned model by submitting malicious unlearning requests, so that the prediction made by the unlearned model can be changed when a particular trigger presents. In our study, we propose two attack approaches. The first attack approach does not require the attacker to poison any training data of the model. The attacker can achieve the attack goal only by requesting to unlearn a small subset of his contributed training data. The second approach allows the attacker to poison a few training instances with a pre-defined trigger upfront, and then activate the attack via submitting a malicious unlearning request. Both attack approaches are proposed with the goal of maximizing the attack utility while ensuring attack stealthiness. The effectiveness of the proposed attacks is demonstrated with different machine unlearning algorithms as well as different models on different datasets.

AB We conducted a 2 x 2 study comparing the digital learning game Decimal Point to a comparable non-game tutor with or without self-explanation prompting. We expected to replicate previous studies showing the game improved learning compared to the non-game tutor, and that self-explanation prompting would enhance learning across platforms. Additionally, prior research with Decimal Point suggested that self-explanation was driving gender differences in which girls learned more than boys. To better understand these effects, we manipulated the presence of self-explanation prompts and incorporated a multidimensional gender measure. We hypothesized that girls and students with stronger feminine-typed characteristics would learn more than boys and students with stronger masculine-typed characteristics in the game with self-explanation condition, but not in the game without self-explanation or in the non-game conditions. Results showed no advantage for the game over the non-game or for including self-explanation, but an analysis of hint usage indicated that students in the game conditions used (and abused) hints more than in the non-game conditions, which in turn was associated with worse learning outcomes. When we controlled for hint use, students in the game conditions learned more than students in the non-game tutor. We replicated a gender effect favoring boys and students with masculine-typed characteristics on the pretest, but there were no gender differences on the posttests. Finally, results indicated that the multidimensional framework explained variance in pretest performance better than a binary gender measure, adding further evidence that this framework may be a more effective, inclusive approach to understanding gender effects in game-based learning.

AB In this paper, we investigate the effect of participating as a near-peer mentor for computing activities in undergraduate courses across disciplines. Many studies on near-peer mentorship have demonstrated academic and professional growth-as well as an increase in self-efficacy-of mentees. In this paper, we focus on how participation as a mentor in an undergraduate Computing Fellows program contributes to the strengthening and expansion of the mentors' computing identity through their interactions in the program, including via investigation of the mutual benefits of the program on mentees and mentors. The Computing Fellows program "attaches" near-peer mentors to undergraduate courses across the sciences, social sciences, humanities, and the arts. The mentors support the integration of computing into courses through activities including in-class workshops and drop-in office hours. In a mixed-methods study, we conducted semi-structured interviews over two years with mentors (all of whom identify as women) after their participation and we cross-reference the results with course evaluation data. We find that fellows' experience in the program, both as near-peer mentors and through their engagement in critical discussions about computing and computing pedagogy as part of their training, expands and deepens their computing identity and the various ways they can engage with computing in their lives in and beyond college.

AB In the setting of conference peer review, the conference aims to accept high-quality papers and reject low-quality papers based on noisy review scores. A recent work proposes the isotonic mechanism, which can elicit the ranking of paper qualities from an author with multiple submissions to help improve the conference's decisions. However, the isotonic mechanism relies on the assumption that the author's utility is both an increasing and a convex function with respect to the review score, which is often violated in realistic settings (e.g. when authors aim to maximize the number of accepted papers). In this paper, we propose a sequential review mechanism that can truthfully elicit the ranking information from authors while only assuming the agent's utility is increasing with respect to the true quality of her accepted papers. The key idea is to review the papers of an author in a sequence based on the provided ranking and conditioning the review of the next paper on the review scores of the previous papers. Advantages of the sequential review mechanism include: 1) eliciting truthful ranking information in a more realistic setting than prior work; 2) reducing the reviewing workload and increasing the average quality of papers being reviewed; 3) incentivizing authors to write fewer papers of higher quality.

ID SAFETY
AB A heap overflow vulnerability occurs when a program written in an unmanaged language such as C or C++ accesses a memory location beyond an object allocation boundary. Malicious users may exploit this vulnerability to corrupt an adjacent object in memory, creating an entry point for a security attack. Despite decades of research, unfortunately, it still remains challenging to detect heap overflow vulnerabilities in real-world programs at a low cost.
   We present TAILCHECK, a new lightweight heap overflow detection scheme that leverages page protection and pointer tagging. When an object is created, TAILCHECK allocates an additional page-protected shadow object, called a TailObject, placing the distance from the object to its TailObject as a tag stored in the unused high-order bits of the object pointer. For every access to the original object, TAILCHECK performs an additional memory access to the TailObject, whose address is computed using the tag. Heap overflows are detected as page faults when an access occurs beyond the TailObject. We evaluated TAILCHECK with four server applications (apache, nginx, memcached, redis) and the SPEC CPU2017 and SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks, successfully finding heap overflows in SPEC CPU2017 gcc. TAILCHECK experiences 4% and 3% run-time overhead for the average and tail (99%) latencies for server applications; and only 33% and 29% runtime overhead for SPEC CPU2017 and SPEC CPU2006, respectively, less than the state-of-the-art solution.

AB When the current limiter activates during large disturbances, the grid-forming inverter (GFM) switches from a voltage source to a current source. This oversight may undermine the accuracy of dynamic state estimation (DSE). To address this issue, this paper models the current limiter as a time-varying impedance, thereby presenting a unified state-space representation for DSE. This allows capturing the dynamics of GFMs in the presence and absence of current limitations. Numerical results on GFMs connected to a modified IEEE 39-bus system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) facilitates spin manipulation without relying on an external magnetic field, opening up exciting possibilities for advanced spintronic devices. In this paper, we examine the effects of crystal momentum (k) nonlinearity and anisotropy on the conventional Rashba effect, with a particular focus on their impact on the spin Hall conductivity (SHC) in a newly predicted family of 2D Janus materials, W2COX (X = S, Se, Te). Using first-principles density functional theory calculations, we confirm the dynamical and mechanical stability of the studied 2D materials. Strikingly, this materials family exhibits pronounced nonlinear Rashba spin splitting at the P point of Brillouin zone near the Fermi level, which cannot be adequately described by the linear-k Rashba model. Therefore, third-order momentum contributions (k3) must be incorporated into the Rashba Hamiltonian. Our analysis reveals that among the studied systems, W2COS exhibits the highest k 3 contribution of - 45 . 9 eV & Aring;3, despite having the lowest linear Rashba constant. A detailed analysis of electronic structure reveals topologically nontrivial behavior in these 2D materials, yielding sizable SHC that is primarily governed by the nonlinear Rashba effect. Notably, these materials also exhibit large spin Hall angle (0.018-2.5 at EF), which is comparable to that of in bulk topological insulators like Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3, and surpassing those in narrow bandgap bulk semiconductors GeTe and SnTe, as well as heavy metals such as Pt. Sizable SHC, large spin Hall angles, and the ability to tune SHC via electric fields without altering the topological properties, rooted in the crystal field splitting, underscore the potential of these materials for spintronic applications.

AB In this study, the strength and ductility of a direct energy deposited (DEDed) metastable beta Ti-5Al-5Mo-5 V-3Cr (wt%, Ti-5553) alloy was explored by tuning the formation of various alpha microstructures through post-heat treatments. The microstructure of DEDed Ti-5553 with and without post-heat treatments was systematically studied using scanning electron microscopy, three-dimensional (3D) focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy tomography, transmission electron microscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and atom probe tomography. Nanoscale omega phase and O ' phase particles were observed in the as-built DEDed Ti-5553 without post-heat treatment for the first time. By altering the aging temperatures and heating rates during post-heat treatments, various microstructural evolution pathways were activated, leading to alpha microstructures with different sizescales, morphologies, and number densities. By fast heating and isothermal aging at 600 degrees C for 2 hours, refined alpha microstructure was formed through the pseudospinodal decomposition mechanism. While slow heating (at the heating rates of 5 degrees C/min or 0.5 degrees C/min) to 600 degrees C and isothermal aging for 2 hours, super-refined alpha microstructures were produced respectively, primarily via omega-assisted and O '-assisted alpha precipitation mechanisms. By fast heating to and isothermal aging at 700 degrees C, fine-scaled intragranular alpha microstructure was formed, dramatically different in morphology and sizescale from the coarse alpha microstructure formed in the casted Ti-5553, which is suspected to be related to the indirect influence of nanoscale isothermal omega phase particles formed during the DED process and the excess oxygen introduced during the DED process. With fast heating to and isothermal aging at 800 degrees C, coarse alpha microstructure forms through the classical nucleation and growth mechanism. Various alpha microstructures led to a drastic change of mechanical properties with improvements up to a 55 % increase in hardness and 92 % increase in tensile yield strength, compared with as-built DEDed Ti-5553. Our work indicates the feasibility of achieving tailored mechanical properties in DEDed metastable beta-Ti alloys by tuning alpha microstructures through selectively activating various phase transformation mechanisms via post-heat treatments.

AB Stalk lodging in the monocot Zea mays is an important agricultural issue that requires the development of a genome-to-phenome framework, mechanistically linking intermediate and high-level phenotypes. As part of that effort, tools are needed to enable better mechanistic understanding of the microstructure in herbaceous plants. A method was therefore developed to create finite element models using CT scan data for Zea mays. This method represents a pipeline for processing the image stacks and developing the finite element models. 2-dimensional finite element models, 3-dimensional watertight models, and 3-dimensional voxel-based finite element models were developed. The finite element models contain both the cell and cell wall structures that can be tested in silico for phenotypes such as structural stiffness and predicted tissue strength. This approach was shown to be successful, and a number of example analyses were presented to demonstrate its usefulness and versatility. This pipeline is important for two reasons: (1) it helps inform which microstructure phenotypes should be investigated to breed for more lodging-resistant stalks, and (2) represents an essential step in the development of a mechanistic hierarchical framework for the genome-to-phenome modeling of herbaceous plant stalk lodging.

In the earlier paper, we experimentally demonstrated slow wave enhanced phase and spectral sensitivity in asymmetric loop-terminated Mach-Zehnder interferometer (LT-MZI) sensors. Compared to MachZehnder interferometers (MZI) that experimentally demonstrated a phase sensitivity 84,000 rad/RIU-cm, the reflected path enhancement of the optical path length coupled with slow light enhancement with photonic crystal waveguides in on-chip slow light loop-terminated Mach-Zehnder interferometer sensors resulted in experimentally demonstrated phase sensitivity 277,750 rad/RIU-cm with theoretical phase sensitivity as high as 461,810 rad/RIUcm, at the same form factor as the MZI of identical interferometer arm lengths.

TI Temperature control strategies for fifth generation district heating and

DT Review
DE District heating and cooling; Fifth Generation District heating and
   cooling; (5GDHC); Temperature control; Modelica
AB Temperature control exerts a significant influence on the performance of Fifth Generation District Heating and Cooling (5GDHC) systems. Ineffective temperature control could lead to not only occupant discomfort and higher operation costs due to increased energy consumption and reduced equipment lifespan, but also a negative environmental impact through higher carbon emissions. Despite its importance, this area remains underexplored, with limited studies conducting in-depth analyses of temperature control strategies applied in 5GDHC systems. To bridge this knowledge gap, this study conducts a comprehensive literature review on temperature control strategies for 5GDHC systems. Three prevalent temperature control strategies have been identified: constant temperature control, multi-stage temperature control, and free-floating temperature control. To facilitate the implementation and relatively fair comparison of these strategies and their various settings, detailed 5GDHC system models have been developed using Modelica. The case study encompasses two network configurations, spans across four distinct climate zones, and evaluates the system performance using five key performance indicators, including total energy consumption, system coefficient of performance (COP), carbon emissions, peak electricity demand and plant capacity. The simulation results reveal that the constant operating temperature control strategy can outperform the free-floating temperature control strategy when appropriate network operating temperature settings are adopted but also exhibit greater sensitivity to changes in these settings. Simple multi-stage temperature control strategies are found to be insufficient to achieve the best system performance. In addition, substation direct cooling could be an effective means to enhance the system performance but necessitates coordination with suitable temperature control strategies to maximize energy savings. In general, the performance of temperature control strategies in 5GDHC systems is strongly influenced by multiple factors such as load profiles, system configurations and specific strategy settings. This study underscores the importance of selecting and designing temperature control strategies based on comprehensive system analyses to achieve high performance 5GDHC systems during operations.

TI Automatic Scoring of Metaphor Creativity with Large Language Models

AB Metaphor is crucial in human cognition and creativity, facilitating abstract thinking, analogical reasoning, and idea generation. Typically, human raters manually score the originality of responses to creative thinking tasks - a laborious and error-prone process. Previous research sought to remedy these risks by scoring creativity tasks automatically using semantic distance and large language models (LLMs). Here, we extend research on automatic creativity scoring to metaphor generation - the ability to creatively describe episodes and concepts using nonliteral language. Metaphor is arguably more abstract and naturalistic than prior targets of automated creativity assessment. We collected 4,589 responses from 1,546 participants to various metaphor prompts and corresponding human creativity ratings. We fine-tuned two open-source LLMs (RoBERTa and GPT-2) - effectively "teaching" them to score metaphors like humans - before testing their ability to accurately assess the creativity of new metaphors. Results showed both models reliably predicted new human creativity ratings (RoBERTa r = .72, GPT-2 r = .70), significantly more strongly than semantic distance (r = .42). Importantly, the fine-tuned models generalized accurately to metaphor prompts they had not been trained on (RoBERTa r = .68, GPT-2 r = .63). We provide open access to the fine-tuned models, allowing researchers to assess metaphor creativity in a reproducible and timely manner.

AB This study presents an early -stage investigation of the evolving surface wettability of metal parts fabricated using laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF). Various printing strategies, surface orientations, and postprocessing methods were evaluated to determine their influence on wettability. Results showed that the wetting properties of AlSi10Mg printed parts were initially superhydrophilic but transitioned to slightly hydrophilic after prolonged air exposure. Additionally, downskin surfaces exhibited higher roughness due to the presence of fused satellite particles. These findings underscore the inherent instability of wetting behavior in metal alloys produced by L-PBF and highlight the need for further exploration of postprocessing techniques to achieve consistent surface wettability.

AB This summer, Oklahoma State University began a Research Experience for Teachers (RET) site focused on circuit design and semiconductors. Our work with math educators led to the development of lesson plans incorporating semiconductors and circuits to offer real-world examples in place of more abstract word problems. Through this effort we expect to improve math engagement of high school students and introduce them to valuable semiconductor topics. The inclusion of circuit and semiconductor topics also begins the workforce development needed to fill the jobs projected to be created by the CHIPS Act. Real-world examples developed focus on diode and MOSFET models as applications of piecewise functions in Algebra I and inductor and capacitor circuits as applications of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

DE Federated Learning; Multi-modal Learning
AB Federated learning (FL) has obtained tremendous progress in providing collaborative training solutions for distributed data silos with privacy guarantees. However, few existing works explore a more realistic scenario where the clients hold multiple data modalities. In this paper, we aim to solve a novel challenge in multi-modal federated learning (MFL) - modality missing - the clients may lose part of the modalities in their local data sets. To tackle the problems, we propose a novel multi-modal federated learning method, Federated Multi-modal contrastiVe training with Pre-trained completion (FedMVP), which integrates the large-scale pre-trained models to enhance the federated training. In the proposed FedMVP framework, each client deploys a large-scale pre-trained model with frozen parameters for modality completion and representation knowledge transfer, enabling efficient and robust local training. On the server side, we utilize generated data to uniformly measure the representation similarity among the uploaded client models and construct a graph perspective to aggregate them according to their importance in the system. We demonstrate that the model achieves superior performance over two real-world image-text classification datasets and is robust to the performance degradation caused by missing modality.

DE HPC; Storage; Database; Profiling; Communication
AB Capturing cross-stack profiling of communication on HPC systems at fine granularity is critical for gaining insights into the detailed performance trade-offs and interplay among various components of HPC ecosystem. To enable this, one needs to be able to collect, store, and retrieve system-wide data at high fidelity. As modern HPC systems expand, ensuring high-fidelity, real-time communication profiling becomes more challenging, especially with the growing number of users employing profiling tools to monitor their workloads. We take on this challenge in this paper and identify the key metrics of performance that makes a database amenable to these needs. We then design benchmarks to measure and understand the performance of multiple, popular, open-source databases. Through rigorous experimental analysis, we demonstrate the performance and scalability trends of the selected databases to perform different types of fundamental storage and retrieval operations under various conditions. Through this work, we are able to achieve sub-second complex data querying serving up to 64 users and demonstrate a "9x" improvement in insertion latency through parallel data insertion, achieving a latency of 55 ms and 50% less disk space for inserting 200,000 rows of profiling data collected from a potential system that is "4x" the size of the state-of-the-art 19th-ranked Frontera supercomputing system at TACC with 8,368 nodes.

ID TRANSCRANIAL FOCUSED ULTRASOUND; BRAIN-STIMULATION
AB Transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (tFUS) has emerged as a potential noninvasive therapeutic technology. Due to skull attenuations at high ultrasound (US) frequencies, successful tFUS with sufficient penetration depth requires sub-MHz US waves, leading to relatively poor stimulation specificity particularly in the axial direction (perpendicular to the US transducer). This shortcoming can potentially be overcome by utilizing two individual US beams properly crossed in time and space. For large-scale tFUS, a phased array is also required to dynamically steer focused US beams at desired neural targets. This article presents the theoretical foundation and optimization (through a wave-propagation simulator) of crossed-beam formation using two US phased arrays. It also experimentally validates crossed-beam formation with two custom-made 32-element phased arrays (operating at 555.5 kHz) positioned relatively at different angles. In measurements, the sub-MHz crossed-beam phased arrays achieved 0.8/3.4 mm lateral/axial resolution at a focal distance of similar to 46 mm, compared to the lateral/axial resolution of 3.4/26.8 mm of the individual phased array at 50 mm focal distance (similar to 28.4-fold improvement in reducing the main focal zone area). The crossed-beam formation in the presence of a rat skull and a tissue layer was also validated in the measurements.

AB Pumping is an essential component in many microfluidic applications. Developing simple, small-footprint, and flexible pumping methods is of great importance to achieve truly lab-on-a-chip systems. Here, we report a novel acoustic pump based on the atomization effect induced by a vibrating sharp-tip capillary. As the liquid is atomized by the vibrating capillary, negative pressure is generated to drive the movement of fluid without the need to fabricate special microstructures or use special channel materials. We studied the influence of the frequency, input power, internal diameter (ID) of the capillary tip, and liquid viscosity on the pumping flow rate. By adjusting the ID of the capillary from 30 & mu;m to 80 & mu;m and the power input from 1 V-pp to 5 V-pp, a flow rate range of 3 to 520 & mu;L/min can be achieved. We also demonstrated the simultaneous operation of two pumps to generate parallel flow with a tunable flow rate ratio. Finally, the capability of performing complex pumping sequences was demonstrated by performing a bead-based ELISA in a 3D-printed microdevice.

AB A reconstruction attack on a private dataset D takes as input some publicly accessible information about the dataset and produces a list of candidate elements of D. We introduce a class of data reconstruction attacks based on randomized methods for nonconvex optimization. We empirically demonstrate that our attacks can not only reconstruct full rows of D from aggregate query statistics Q(D) is an element of Rm but can do so in a way that reliably ranks reconstructed rows by their odds of appearing in the private data, providing a signature that could be used for prioritizing reconstructed rows for further actions such as identity theft or hate crime. We also design a sequence of baselines for evaluating reconstruction attacks. Our attacks significantly outperform those that are based only on access to a public distribution or population from which the private dataset D was sampled, demonstrating that they are exploiting information in the aggregate statistics Q(D) and not simply the overall structure of the distribution. In other words, the queries Q(D) are permitting reconstruction of elements of this dataset, not the distribution from which D was drawn. These findings are established both on 2010 US decennial Census data and queries and Census-derived American Community Survey datasets. Taken together, our methods and experiments illustrate the risks in releasing numerically precise aggregate statistics of a large dataset and provide further motivation for the careful application of provably private techniques such as differential privacy.

AB In artificial intelligence (AI), negative social impact (NSI) represents the negative effect on the society as a result of mistakes conducted by AI agents. While the photo classification problem has been widely studied in the AI community, the NSI made by photo misclassification is largely ignored due to the lack of quantitative measurements of the NSI and effective approaches to reduce it. In this paper, we focus on an NSI-aware photo classification problem where the goal is to develop a novel crowd-AI collaborative learning framework that leverages online crowd workers to quantitatively estimate and effectively reduce the NSI of misclassified photos. Our problem is motivated by the limitations of current NSI-aware photo classification approaches that either 1) cannot accurately estimate NSI because they simply model NSI as the semantic difference between true and misclassified categories or 2) require costly human annotations to estimate NSI of pairwise class categories. To address such limitations, we develop SocialCrowd, a crowdsourcing-based NSI-aware photo classification framework that explicitly reduces the NSI of photo misclassification by designing a duo relational NSI-aware graph with the NSI estimated by online crowd workers. The evaluation results on two large-scale image datasets show that SocialCrowd not only reduces the NSI of photo misclassification but also improves the classification accuracy on both datasets.

AB A previously developed spatiotemporal model is enhanced to simulate detailed dynamic and cyclic behavior of closed-circuit RO (CCRO). The partial differential equation (PDE) model couples water balance, salt balance and momentum balance and explicitly accounts for pressure drop, concentration polarization and axial dispersion in both closed-circuit (CC) and flushing modes. Simulation case studies using conditions similar to those in a well -studied industrial brackish water plant were carried out and the specific energy consumption (SEC) in CCRO at the cyclic steady state (CSS) was analyzed from thermodynamic restriction, flux requirement, flow resistance, concentration polarization and salt retention. On the basis of the same flux used in industrial conditions, CCRO is not as energy efficient as state-of-the-art multi-stage RO for low-salinity brackish water desalination. Operating CCRO at a reduced flux can make it competitive.

AB Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) is an enabling process manufacture of complex metal components. However, LPBF is prone to generate geometrical defects (e.g., porosity, lack of fusion), which causes a significant fatigue scattering. However, LPBF fatigue scattering data and analysis in the literature are not only sparse and limited to tension-compression mode but also inconsistent. This article presents a robust high-frequency fatigue testing method to construct stress-cycle curves of SS 316L to understand the scattering nature and predict the scattering pattern. A series of bending fatigue tests are performed at different stress amplitudes. Two different runout criteria are used to investigate fatigue life, fatigue limits, and scattering. The endurance limit reaches around 300 MPa for the defect size distribution at the selected process space. The defect size-based fatigue limit model is found to underestimate the endurance limit by about 30 MPa when comparing with the experimental data. Fatigue scattering is further calculated by using 95% prediction intervals, showing that low fatigue scattering is present at high stresses while a large variation of fatigue life occurs at stresses near the knee point.

AB Using a representative translational dimer model, high throughput calculations are implemented for fast screening of a total of 74 diacenaphtho-extended heterocycle (DAH) derivatives as hole transport layer (HTL) materials in perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). Different electronic properties, including band structures, band gaps, and band edges compared to methylammonium and formamidinium lead iodide perovskites, along with reorganization energies, electronic couplings, and hole mobilities are calculated in order to decipher the effects of different parameters, including the polarity, steric and pi-conjugation, as well as the presence of explicit hydrogen bond interactions on the computed carrier mobilities of the studied materials. Full crystal structure predictions and hole mobility calculations of the top candidates resulted in some mobilities exceeding 10 cm2/V<middle dot>s, further validating the employed translational dimer model as a robust approach for inverse design and fast high-throughput screening of new HTL organic semiconductors with superior properties. The studied models and simulations performed in this work are instructive in designing next-generation HTL materials for higher-performance PVSCs.

AB The co-optimization of behind-the-meter distributed energy resources is considered for prosumers under the net energy metering tariff. The distributed energy resources considered include renewable generations, flexible demands, and battery energy storage systems. An energy management system co-optimizes the consumptions and battery storage based on locally available stochastic renewables by solving a stochastic dynamic program that maximizes the expected operation surplus. To circumvent the exponential complexity of the dynamic program solution, we propose a closed-form and linear computation complexity co-optimization algorithm based on a relaxation-projection approach to a constrained stochastic dynamic program. Sufficient conditions for optimality for the proposed solution are obtained. Numerical studies demonstrate orders of magnitude reduction of computation costs and significantly reduced optimality gap.

AB A significant waste material threatening sustainability efforts are post-consumer food packaging goods. These ubiquitous multi-materials comprise chemically disparate components and are thus challenging targets for recycling. Herein, we undertake a proof-of-principle study in which we use a single-stage method to convert post-consumer multi-material food packaging (post-consumer peanut butter jars) to a high compressive strength composite (PBJS90). This is accomplished by thiocracking the ground jar pulp (10 wt. %) with elemental sulfur (90 wt. %) at 320 degrees C for 2 h. This is the first application of thiocracking to such mixed-material post-consumer goods. Composite synthesis proceeded with 100% atom economy, a low E factor of 0.02, and negative global warming potential of -0.099 kg CO2e/kg. Furthermore, the compressive strength of PBJS90 (37.7 MPa) is over twice that required for Portland cement building foundations. The simplicity of composite synthesis using a lower temperature/shorter heating time than needed for mineral cements, and exclusive use of waste materials as precursors are ecologically beneficial and represent an important proof-of-principle approach to using thiocracking as a strategy for upcycling multi-materials to useful composites.

ID SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION; NETWORK; CONTEXT
AB When performing remote sensing image segmentation, practitioners often encounter various challenges, such as a strong imbalance in the foreground-background, the presence of tiny objects, high object density, intra-class heterogeneity, and inter-class homogeneity. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces AerialFormer, a hybrid model that strategically combines the strengths of Transformers and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). AerialFormer features a CNN Stem module integrated to preserve low-level and high-resolution features, enhancing the model's capability to process details of aerial imagery. The proposed AerialFormer is designed with a hierarchical structure, in which a Transformer encoder generates multi-scale features and a multi-dilated CNN (MDC) decoder aggregates the information from the multi-scale inputs. As a result, information is taken into account in both local and global contexts, so that powerful representations and high-resolution segmentation can be achieved. The proposed AerialFormer was benchmarked on three benchmark datasets, including iSAID, LoveDA, and Potsdam. Comprehensive experiments and extensive ablation studies show that the proposed AerialFormer remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

   FRAMEWORK; CFD
AB Machine learning (ML) is a powerful tool for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) because it can use data to correct imperfect physical models (e.g., turbulence models) and improve the simulation accuracy for challenging flow conditions, e.g., separated flow. Among many ML approaches, field inversion ML has the advantages of model consistency and low data dependency and can train generalizable models with limited data. However, the field inversion has a high entry bar because it requires a CFD-solver-intrusive implementation of adjoint methods to compute gradients. Due to this limitation, all existing field inversion ML studies focused on improving steady-state flow predictions. This paper will break this limit by developing a time-accurate adjoint method to enable the field inversion of unsteady flow. We solve the unsteady incompressible flow using a segregated PIMPLE algorithm and then compute unsteady gradients using a new segregated adjoint method. We use the proposed PIMPLE-adjoint to demonstrate field inversion optimization for unsteady separated flow over a ramp, which is representative of many unsteady flows in aerospace engineering. We consider various options to formulate the objective function for unsteady field inversion using a laminar flow case. We find that the inverse flow field agrees well with the reference data if the objective function formulation includes all relevant unsteady flow physics. Then, we consider a turbulent case and multiply the production term of the Spalart-Allmaras (SA) turbulence model by a scalar field (beta). We run unsteady field inversion to optimize the SA model's beta field and make its predictions match the spatial-temporal distribution of reference data generated by the k-omega SST model. In addition, we evaluate the field inversion's capabilities to predict temporally unseen flow fields and predict flow variables not formulated in the objective function. The spatial-temporal distributions of inverse flow fields agree reasonably well with the reference data for all the above cases. The proposed method has the potential to train generalizable and accurate turbulence models for predicting challenging unsteady flow in aerospace engineering.

AB The visual modality is central to both reception and expression of human creativity. Creativity assessment paradigms, such as structured drawing tasks Barbot (2018), seek to characterize this key modality of creative ideation. However, visual creativity assessment paradigms often rely on cohorts of expert or naive raters to gauge the level of creativity of the outputs. This comes at the cost of substantial human investment in both time and labor. To address these issues, recent work has leveraged the power of machine learning techniques to automatically extract creativity scores in the verbal domain (e.g., SemDis; Beaty & Johnson 53, 757-780, 2021). Yet, a comparably well-vetted solution for the assessment of visual creativity is missing. Here, we introduce AuDrA - an Automated Drawing Assessment platform to extract visual creativity scores from simple drawing productions. Using a collection of line drawings and human creativity ratings, we trained AuDrA and tested its generalizability to untrained drawing sets, raters, and tasks. Across four datasets, nearly 60 raters, and over 13,000 drawings, we found AuDrA scores to be highly correlated with human creativity ratings for new drawings on the same drawing task (r = .65 to .81; mean = .76). Importantly, correlations between AuDrA scores and human raters surpassed those between drawings' elaboration (i.e., ink on the page) and human creativity raters, suggesting that AuDrA is sensitive to features of drawings beyond simple degree of complexity. We discuss future directions, limitations, and link the trained AuDrA model and a tutorial (https://osf.io/kqn9v/) to enable researchers to efficiently assess new drawings.

AB Rapid and efficient infrastructure restoration is critical to reducing the impacts of extreme events on community lifelines. Following a large-scale extreme event, infrastructure restoration at various stages is carried out simultaneously by agencies at various government levels and jurisdictions. Since each agency has different roles, responsibilities, and boundaries within which it operates, coordination and communication among them are challenging. With the overall goal of providing a common operating picture and facilitating concerted planning and action among emergency response agencies, this research proposes a data-driven and equity-centered framework that links the various stages-damage identification, restoration scheduling, and monitoring and control-of infrastructure restoration. This study takes a particular focus on the highway restoration caused by flood inundation. In detail, the framework is composed of three parts, including (1) a systematic data-driven approach that quickly provides spatially distributed estimates of highway inundation, (2) an equity-centered restoration scheduling strategy that prioritizes restoration tasks based on community social vulnerability, and (3) a Bayesian-based approach that provides an up-to-date indication of the impacts of component level changes on the overall restoration progress. A case study on highway inundation in Harris County during Hurricane Harvey was conducted to demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of the proposed framework. In the case study, multisource data, including physical highway topology, geospatial information, field inspection results, and socioeconomic and demographic data, were used. Our framework generates outputs that can be used for rapid damage identification, automated restoration scheduling, and real-time progress updating. In practice, these outputs facilitate quick and shared situational awareness among the involved agencies, which is expected to ease communication and coordination and help overcome challenges resulting from parallel and fragmented restoration efforts. To the authors' best knowledge, this is the first framework that aims to support the management of infrastructure restoration by synthesizing various restoration stages.

AB We present a new multimodal, context-based dataset for continuous authentication. The dataset contains 27 subjects, with an age range of [8, 72], where data has been collected across multiple sessions while the subjects are watching videos meant to elicit an emotional response. Collected data includes accelerometer data, heart rate, electrodermal activity, skin temperature, and face videos. We also propose a baseline approach for fair comparisons when using the proposed dataset. The approach uses a combination of a pretrained backbone network with supervised contrastive loss for face. Time-series features are also extracted, from the physiological signals, which are used for classification. This approach, on the proposed dataset, results in an average accuracy, precision, and recall of 76.59%, 88.90, and 53.25, respectively, on electrical signals, and 90.39%, 98.77, and 75.71, respectively on face videos.

AB This paper focuses on the AI-based damage assessment (ADA) applications that leverage state-of-theart AI techniques to automatically assess the disaster damage severity using online social media imagery data, which aligns well with the "disaster risk reduction" target under United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). This paper studies an ADA model generality problem where the objective is to address the limitation of current ADA solutions that are often optimized only for a single disaster event and lack the generality to provide accurate performance across different disaster events. To address this limitation, we work with domain experts and local community stakeholders in disaster response to develop CollabGeneral, a subjective logic-driven crowd-AI collaborative learning framework that integrates AI and crowdsourced human intelligence into a principled learning framework to address the ADA model generality problem. Extensive experiments on four real-world ADA datasets demonstrate that CollabGeneral consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines by significantly improving the ADA model generality across different disasters.

DE fairness; online learning; disentanglement; changing environments
AB In the problem of online learning for changing environments, data are sequentially received one after another over time, and their distribution assumptions may vary frequently. Although existing methods demonstrate the effectiveness of their learning algorithms by providing a tight bound on either dynamic regret or adaptive regret, most of them completely ignore learning with model fairness, defined as the statistical parity across different sub-population (e.g., race and gender). Another drawback is that when adapting to a new environment, an online learner needs to update model parameters with a global change, which is costly and inefficient. Inspired by the sparse mechanism shift hypothesis [22], we claim that changing environments in online learning can be attributed to partial changes in learned parameters that are specific to environments and the rest remain invariant to changing environments. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel algorithm under the assumption that data collected at each time can be disentangled with two representations, an environment-invariant semantic factor and an environment-specific variation factor. The semantic factor is further used for fair prediction under a group fairness constraint. To evaluate the sequence of model parameters generated by the learner, a novel regret is proposed in which it takes a mixed form of dynamic and static regret metrics followed by a fairness-aware long-term constraint. The detailed analysis provides theoretical guarantees for loss regret and violation of cumulative fairness constraints. Empirical evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate our proposed method sequentially outperforms baseline methods in model accuracy and fairness.

DE ethical artificial intelligence; fairness-aware; machine learning
AB Ethical AI has become increasingly important, and it has been attracting attention from academia and industry, due to its increased popularity in real-world applications with fairness concerns. It also places fundamental importance on ethical considerations in determining legitimate and illegitimate uses of AI. Organizations that apply ethical AI have clearly stated well-defined review processes to ensure adherence to legal guidelines. Therefore, the wave of research at the intersection of ethical AI in data mining and machine learning has also influenced other fields of science, including computer vision, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, and social science. Despite these successes, ethical AI still faces many challenges, such as a lack of interpretable and explainable methods for fairness-aware deep learning models, etc. Consequently, there is an urgent need to bring experts and researchers together at prestigious venues to discuss ethical AI, which has been rarely seen in previous KDD conferences. This workshop will provide a premium platform for both research and industry from different backgrounds to exchange ideas on opportunities, challenges, and cutting-edge techniques in ethical AI.

AB In this article, we study how the marketing of single-family homes explains the racial and income makeup of mortgage applicants in a neighborhood. We use a case study of the robust housing market of Charlotte, North Carolina, and annual, longitudinal real estate listing advertisements alongside mortgage lending data, to demonstrate how the share of properties advertised a certain way in a neighborhood in 1 year explains shares of mortgage applicants by race and income the following year. We classify property advertisement text using a semi-supervised learning algorithm into five categories following a housing investment and disinvestment to renewal continuum. We find stark racial disparities in mortgage applicants by housing type, even after controlling for income. We find that Black applicants nearly exclusively apply for mortgages in neighborhoods with a high share of properties advertised as disinvested with little profit-making promise. High-income White applicants rise as the share of advertised properties becomes more homogenous.

ID FAKE NEWS
AB Training large deep learning (DL) models with high performance for natural language downstream tasks usually requires rich-labeled data. However, in a real-world application of COVID-19 information service (e.g., misinformation detection, question answering), a fundamental challenge is the lack of the labeled COVID data to enable supervised end-to-end training of the models for different downstream tasks, especially at the early stage of the pandemic. To address this challenge, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation framework using contrastive learning and adversarial domain mixup to transfer the knowledge from an existing source data domain to the target COVID-19 data domain. In particular, to bridge the gap between the source domain and the target domain, our method reduces a radial basis function (RBF) based discrepancy between these two domains. Moreover, we leverage the power of domain adversarial examples to establish an intermediate domain mixup, where the latent representations of the input text from both domains could be mixed during the training process. In this paper, we focus on two prevailing downstream tasks in mining COVID-19 text data: COVID-19 misinformation detection and COVID-19 news question answering. Extensive domain adaptation experiments on multiple real-world datasets suggest that our method can effectively adapt misinformation detection and question answering systems to the unseen COVID-19 target domain with significant improvements compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.

ID SCIENCE; EQUITY
AB This study explores the experiences of three Networked Improvement Communities (NICs) within mathematics departments as they work to critically transform their introductory mathematics programs. Drawing on the framework of dominant and critical axes of equity, we identify three key tensions experienced by the NICs: identity neutrality versus identity centrality, power over versus power with, and students as novices versus students as experts. These tensions are framed as productive enactments of working to change systems from within, highlighting the challenges and opportunities inherent in navigating the liminal space of nepantla. We argue that engaging with these tensions is crucial for fostering critical transformations and offer recommendations for leveraging the roles of identity, power, and student partnership to promote more equitable and inclusive mathematics education environments.

DE Social infrastructure; Diversity; Human mobility; Social capital
ID COMMUNITY; HEALTH
AB Casual encounters with diverse groups of people in urban spaces have been shown to foster social capital and trust, leading to higher quality of life, civic participation, and community resilience to hazards. To promote such diverse encounters and cultivate social ties, policymakers develop social infrastructure sites, such as community centers, parks, and plazas. However, their effects on the diversity of encounters, compared to baseline sites (e.g., grocery stores), have not been fully understood. In this study, we use a large-scale, privacy-enhanced mobility dataset of >120 K anonymized mobile phone users in the Boston area to evaluate the effects of social infrastructure sites on the observed frequencies of inter-income and inter-race encounters. Contrary to our intuition that all social infrastructure sites promote diverse encounters, we find the effects to be mixed and more nuanced. Overall, parks and social businesses promote more inter-income encounters, while community spaces promote more same-income encounters, but each produces opposite effects for inter-race encounters. Parks and community spaces located in low-income neighborhoods were shown to result in higher inter-income and inter-race encounters compared to ordinary sites, respectively, however, their associations were insignificant in highincome areas. These empirical results suggest that the type of social infrastructure and neighborhood traits may alter levels of diverse encounters.

AB College students may have limited access to produce and may lack confidence in preparing it, but cooking videos can show how to make healthy dishes. The Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning suggests that learning is enhanced when visual and auditory information is presented considering cognitive load (e.g., highlighting important concepts, eliminating extraneous information, and keeping the video brief and conversational). The purpose of this project was to pilot test a food label for produce grown at an urban university and assess whether student confidence in preparing produce improved after using the label and QR code to view a recipe video developed using principles from the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning. The video showed a student preparing a salad with ingredients available on campus. Students indicated the label was helpful and reported greater perceived confidence in preparing lettuce after viewing the label and video (mean confidence of 5.60 +/- 1.40 before vs. 6.14 +/- 0.89 after, p = 0.016, n = 28). Keeping the video short and providing ingredients and amounts onscreen as text were cited as helpful. Thus, a brief cooking video and interactive label may improve confidence in preparing produce available on campus. Future work should determine whether the label impacts produce consumption and if it varies depending on the type of produce used.

ID GRAVITATIONAL-RADIATION; SOLITON STARS; RELATIVITY; SYSTEMS
AB We perform the first nonlinear and self-consistent study of the merger and ringdown of a black hole mimicking object with stable light rings. To that end, we numerically solve the full Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations governing the head-on collisions of a series of binary boson stars in the large-mass-ratio regime resulting in spinning horizonless remnants with stable light rings. We broadly confirm the appearance of features in the extracted gravitational waveforms expected based on perturbative methods: the signal from the prompt response of the remnants approaches that of a Kerr black hole in the large-compactness limit, and the subsequent emissions contain periodically appearing bursts akin to so-called gravitational wave echoes. However, these bursts occur at high frequencies and are sourced by perturbations of the remnant's internal degrees of freedom. Furthermore, the emitted waveforms also contain a large-amplitude and longlived component comparable in frequency to black hole quasinormal modes. We further characterize the emissions, obtain basic scaling relations of relevant timescales, and compute the energy emitted in gravitational waves.

AB Families are significant influences on children's interest, engagement, and aspirations (IEA) in science. However, research exploring family impact on children's IEA in science rarely seeks families' voices. Using the constructs of family science capital and family science habitus as well as the Community Culture Wealth Framework to frame the research, focus groups were conducted with forty parents in the southeastern U.S. to uncover how families support IEA in science. There were four findings regarding how families support children's IEA in science: (1) families acknowledge and encourage scientific wonderings and learning; (2) families engage in informal family science experiences; (3) families strive to provide science resources; and (4) there was a preponderance of family science habitus as well as familial and linguistic capital in their supports of IEA in science. Given the significant influence families can have, it is imperative for educators to better understand these supports and how they might be leveraged for meaningful science education both in and outside of school. This study may serve as a launchpoint for family partnerships with schools and other stakeholders who want to build on or leverage the assets families have, as these stakeholders (re)consider what they believe about families and science.

AB We introduce a simple synthetic strategy to selectively degrade bottlebrush networks derived from well-defined poly(4-methylcaprolactone) (P4MCL) bottlebrush polymers. Functionalization of the hydroxyl groups present at the terminal ends of P4MCL side chains with alpha-lipoic acid resulted in bottlebrush polymers having a range of molecular weights (M-n = 45-2200 kg mol(-1)) and a tunable number of reactive dithiolane chain ends. These functionalized chain ends act as efficient crosslinkers due to radical ring-opening of the dithiolane rings under UV light. The resulting redox-active disulfide crosslinks enable mild electrochemical or chemical degradation of the S-S crosslinks to regenerate the starting bottlebrush polymer. P4MCL side chains and the disulfides can be degraded simultaneously using harsher reducing conditions. This combination of bottlebrush architecture with facile disulfide crosslinking presents a versatile platform for preparing highly tunable elastomers that undergo controlled degradation under mild conditions.

TI Spatial organization of bacterial sphingolipid synthesis enzymes
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
LA English
DT Article
ID CELL-ENVELOPE; MUTANTS
AB Sphingolipids are produced by nearly all eukaryotes where they play significant roles in cellular processes such as cell growth, division, programmed cell death, angiogenesis, and inflammation. While it was previously believed that sphingolipids were quite rare among bacteria, bioinformatic analysis of the recently identified bacterial sphingolipid synthesis genes suggests that these lipids are likely to be produced by a wide range of microbial species. The sphingolipid synthesis pathway consists of three critical enzymes. Serine palmitoyltransferase catalyzes the condensation of serine with palmitoyl-CoA (or palmitoyl-acyl carrier protein), ceramide synthase adds the second acyl chain, and a reductase reduces the ketone present on the long-chain base. While there is general agreement regarding the identity of these bacterial enzymes, the precise mechanism and order of chemical reactions for microbial sphingolipid synthesis is more ambiguous. Two mechanisms have been proposed. First, the synthesis pathway may follow the well characterized eukaryotic pathway in which the longchain base is reduced prior to the addition of the second acyl chain. Alternatively, our previous work suggests that addition of the second acyl chain precedes the reduction of the longchain base. To distinguish between these two models, we investigated the subcellular localization of these three key enzymes. We found that serine palmitoyltransferase and ceramide synthase are localized to the cytoplasm, whereas the ceramide reductase is in the periplasmic space. This is consistent with our previously proposed model wherein the second acyl chain is added in the cytoplasm prior to export to the periplasm where the lipid molecule is reduced.

AB Antibiotic use in apiculture is often necessary to ensure the survival of honey bee colonies. However, beekeepers are faced with the dilemma of needing to combat bacterial brood infections while also knowing that antibiotics kill beneficial bacteria important for bee health. In recent years, bee probiotics have become increasingly purchased by beekeepers because of product claims like being able to "replenish the microbes lost due to agricultural modifications of honey bees' environment" or "promote optimal gut health." Unfortunately, these products have little scientific evidence to support their efficacy, and previous lab experiments have refuted some of their claims. Here, we performed hive-level field experiments to test the effectiveness of SuperDFM-HoneyBee (TM) - the most commonly purchased honey bee probiotic in the United States - on restoring the honey bee gut microbiota after antibiotic treatment. We found slight but significant changes in the microbiota composition of bees following oxytetracycline (TerraPro) treatment and no difference between the microbiota of antibiotic treated bees with or without subsequent probiotic supplementation. Moreover, the microorganisms in the probiotic supplement were never found in the guts of the worker bee samples. These results highlight that more research is needed to test the efficacy and outcomes of currently available commercial honey bee probiotic supplements.

AB Four extreme ultraviolet (EUV) solar radiation proxies (Magnesium II core-to-wing ratio (MgII), Lyman a flux (F-alpha), 10.7-cm solar radio flux (F-10.7), and sunspot number (Rz)) were analyzed during the last four consecutive solar activity minima to investigate how they differ during minimum periods and how well they represent solar EUV radiation. Their variability within each minimum and between minima was compared by considering monthly means. A comparison was also made of their role in filtering the effect of solar activity from the critical frequency of the ionospheric F-2 layer, f(o)F(2), which at mid to low latitudes depends mainly on EUV solar radiation. The last two solar cycles showed unusually low EUV radiation levels according to the four proxies. Regarding the connection between the EUV "true" variation and that of solar proxies, according to the f(o)F(2) filtering analysis, MgII and Fa behaved in a more stable and suitable way, whereas Rz and F-10.7 could be overestimating EUV levels during the last two minima, implying they would both underestimate the interminima difference of EUV when compared with the first two minima.

ID NONLINEAR QUANTUM-MECHANICS; DYNAMICS
AB Nonlinear qubit master equations have recently been shown to exhibit rich dynamical phenomena such as period doubling, Hopf bifurcation, and strange attractors usually associated with classical nonlinear systems. Here we investigate nonlinear qubit models that support tunable Lorenz attractors. A Lorenz qubit could be realized experimentally by combining qubit torsion, generated by real or simulated mean field dynamics, with linear amplification and dissipation. This would extend engineered Lorenz systems to the quantum regime, allowing for their direct experimental study and possible application to quantum information processing.

AB The energetics of the original Closed-Circuit RO (CCRO) may be improved by adding a reciprocating-piston cylinder whose size may not be adjusted in real time during operation, thus limiting the maximum stroke length of the piston. In this work, the effect of the actual-to-ideal ratio of cylinder sizing on the performance of the improved CCRO is analyzed. If the cylinder is under-sized, the CC filtration step may start with the original CCRO and transition to the improved CCRO. If over-sized, only the improved CCRO is implemented, while the CC filtration and flushing periods are extended. For ultra-high recovery applications studied in this work, undersizing the cylinder by 70 % or over-sizing by 50 % revealed a 2 % or less extra energy consumption using a spatiotemporal model, confirming its operational flexibility.

AB Simple Summary Naked mole-rats live in crowded underground burrows where concentrations of oxygen can be low and concentrations of carbon dioxide can be high. Accordingly, this species is tolerant of low oxygen levels and high carbon dioxide levels, which would be deadly to most surface dwellers. The current article reviews what we know about these unusual tolerances and their underlying mechanisms. Understanding these mechanisms could lead to new strategies for treating human disorders related to low oxygen and high carbon dioxide, as experienced, for example, during a heart attack. Naked mole-rats (Heterocephalus glaber) are very unusual among subterranean mammals in that they live in large colonies and are extremely social, spending large amounts of time gathered together in underground nests more than a meter below the surface. Many respiring individuals resting in deep, poorly ventilated nests deplete the oxygen supply and increase the concentration of carbon dioxide. Consistent with living in that atmosphere, naked mole-rats tolerate levels of low oxygen and high carbon dioxide that are deadly to most surface-dwelling mammals. Naked mole-rats appear to have evolved a number of remarkable adaptations to be able to thrive in this harsh atmosphere. In order to successfully survive low oxygen atmospheres, they conserve energy utilization by reducing the physiological activity of all organs, manifest by reduced heart rate and brain activity. Amazingly, they resort to the anaerobic metabolism of fructose rather than glucose as a fuel to generate energy when challenged by anoxia. Similarly, high carbon dioxide atmospheres normally cause tissue acidosis, while naked mole-rats have a genetic mutation preventing both acid-induced pain and pulmonary edema. Together, these putative adaptations and the tolerances they provide make the naked mole-rat an important model for studying a host of biomedical challenges.

AB Productive utilization of lignocellulosic biomass is critical to the continued advancement of human civilization. Whereas the cellulose component can be efficiently upconverted to automotive fuel-grade ethanol, the lack of upconversion methods for the lignin component constitutes one of the grand challenges facing science. Lignin is an attractive feedstock for structural applications, in which its highly-crosslinked architecture can endow composite structures with high strengths. Prior work suggests that high-strength composites can be prepared by the reaction of olefin-modified lignin with sulfur. Those studies were limited to <= 5 wt% lignin, due to phase-separation of hydrophilic lignin from hydrophobic sulfur matrices. Herein we report a protocol to increase lignin hydrophobicity and thus its incorporation into sulfur-rich materials. This improvement is affected by esterifying lignin with oleic acid prior to its reaction with sulfur. This approach allowed preparation of esterified lignin-sulfur (ELS) composites comprising up to 20 wt% lignin. Two reaction temperatures were employed such that the reaction of ELS with sulfur at 180 degrees C would only produce S-C bonds at olefinic sites, whereas the reaction at 230 degrees C would produce C-S bonds at both olefin and aryl sites. Mechanistic analyses and microstructural characterization elucidated two ELS composites having compressive strength values (>20 MPa), exceeding the values observed with ordinary Portland cements. Consequently, this new method represents a way to improve lignin utilization to produce durable composites that represent sustainable alternatives to Portland cements.

AB We propose a social welfare maximizing mechanism for an energy community that aggregates individual and shared community resources under a general net energy metering (NEM) policy. Referred to as Dynamic NEM, the proposed mechanism adopts the standard NEM tariff model and sets NEM prices dynamically based on the total shared renewables within the community. We show that Dynamic NEM aligns the individual member's incentive with that of the overall community; each member optimizing individual surplus under Dynamic NEM results in maximum community's social welfare. We further show that Dynamic NEM guarantees a higher benefit to each community member than possible outside the community. Dynamic NEM is also shown to satisfy the cost-causation principle. Empirical studies using real data on a hypothetical energy community demonstrate the benefits to community members and grid operators.

AB With increasing penetrations of renewable energy in power distribution systems, operators is facing challenges on reducing renewable energy curtailment, which is caused by supply-demand mismatch, feeder congestion, and nodal voltage limits. Converting surplus renewable electricity into hydrogen by electrolyzors has been recognized a potential way to address this. To this end, we proposed a coordinated operation approach for hydrogen and power distribution systems, considering distribution level power and hydrogen pipeline flows, as well as storage capabilities provided by linepack. The proposed approach can be used to investigate the benefits from our coordinated approach on the basis of current separated practice. Our numerical simulations show that the proposed coordinated dispatch model can utilize the benefit of renewable power to minimum the total cost and improve the utilization of transmission lines.

AB With emerging topics (e.g., COVID-19) on social media as a source for the spreading misinformation, overcoming the distributional shifts between the original training domain (i.e., source domain) and such target domains remains a non-trivial task for misinformation detection. This presents an elusive challenge for early-stage misinformation detection, where a good amount of data and annotations from the target domain is not available for training. To address the data scarcity issue, we propose MetaAdapt, a meta learning based approach for domain adaptive few-shot misinformation detection. MetaAdapt leverages limited target examples to provide feedback and guide the knowledge transfer from the source to the target domain (i.e., learn to adapt). In particular, we train the initial model with multiple source tasks and compute their similarity scores to the meta task. Based on the similarity scores, we rescale the meta gradients to adaptively learn from the source tasks. As such, MetaAdapt can learn how to adapt the misinformation detection model and exploit the source data for improved performance in the target domain. To demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our method, we perform extensive experiments to compare MetaAdapt with state-of-the-art baselines and large language models (LLMs) such as LLaMA, where MetaAdapt achieves better performance in domain adaptive few-shot misinformation detection with substantially reduced parameters on real-world datasets.

AB The recent proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has led to divergent narratives about their environmental impacts. Some studies highlight the substantial carbon footprint of training and using LLMs, while others argue that LLMs can lead to more sustainable alternatives to current practices. We reconcile these narratives by presenting a comparative assessment of the environmental impact of LLMs vs. human labor, examining their relative efficiency across energy consumption, carbon emissions, water usage, and cost. Our findings reveal that, while LLMs have substantial environmental impacts, their relative impacts can be dramatically lower than human labor in the U.S. for the same output, with human-to-LLM ratios ranging from 40 to 150 for a typical LLM (Llama-3-70B) and from 1200 to 4400 for a lightweight LLM (Gemma-2B-it). While the human-to-LLM ratios are smaller with regard to human labor in India, these ratios are still between 3.4 and 16 for a typical LLM and between 130 and 1100 for a lightweight LLM. Despite the potential benefit of switching from humans to LLMs, economic factors may cause widespread adoption to lead to a new combination of human and LLM-driven work, rather than a simple substitution. Moreover, the growing size of LLMs may substantially increase their energy consumption and lower the human-to-LLM ratios, highlighting the need for further research to ensure the sustainability and efficiency of LLMs.

AB In the context of rising urban temperatures, this investigation delves into the impacts of solar reflectance on glazed facades, shedding light on urban microclimates and the resulting thermal experiences. Recent retrofit strategies have employed low emissivity and high solar reflective materials to enhance energy efficiency and indoor comfort against climbing outdoor temperatures. Despite these advances, adverse effects on outdoor heat conditions are often reported due to the intrinsic relationships among the glazed facades' optical and thermal properties, highlighting a gap in thorough, quantitative assessments in this domain. Accordingly, this study aims to bridge this gap, examining the comprehensive effects of glazed facades' solar reflectance on building energy performance and the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) in densely populated urban settings. Utilizing computational simulations and empirical analysis, we scrutinized changes in outdoor solar radiation, ground temperature, UTCI, and building-specific energy demands, including heating, cooling, and lighting energy use, correlating these with varying fa & ccedil;ade's solar reflectance levels during peak summer periods. Results affirm the potential of highly solar reflective facades to substantially cut cooling energy needs by mitigating solar heat gain and thermal conductance. However, a notable byproduct is the upsurge in UTCI, signaling increased heat stress risk within urban canyons. Our comprehensive, multi-objective optimization approach seeks to harmonize the solar reflectance of facades, aiming to reconcile energy conservation with the imperative of maintaining urban thermal comfort. This research contributes significantly to urban retrofit strategies and also guides the potential sustainable urban and landscape design that harmonizes urban energy savings with the mitigation of urban heat implications.

AB This dataset provides a comprehensive set of side channels from fused deposition modeling 3D printers in order to enable the research in the security of additive manufacturing processes against side channel attacks. These attacks exploit indirect signal emanations from physical processes to extract information about a system. Our data was collected using two different methods (iPhone app and Teensy 4.0 sensor system) on two different 3D printers (Bambu Lab P1P and A1 mini), and consists of two types of data, audio data in the form of the recording of the 3D printer's sound while printing, and vibration data in the form of the linear acceleration in the cartesian coordinates. The dataset includes data from 12 different 3D objects that cover a wide variety of movements made while 3D printing. Along with the side channels this dataset includes the source computer-aided design files of the objects, as well as .gcode and .3mf files used by the printers. (c) 2024 The Author(s).

AB From a glimpse of a face, people form trait impressions that operate as facial stereotypes, which are largely inaccurate yet nevertheless drive social behavior. Behavioral studies have long pointed to dimensions of trustworthiness and dominance that are thought to underlie face impressions due to their evolutionarily adaptive nature. Using human neuroimaging (N = 26, 19 female, 7 male), we identify a two-dimensional representation of faces' inferred traits in the middle temporal gyrus (MTG), a region involved in domain-general conceptual processing including the activation of social concepts. The similarity of neural-response patterns for any given pair of faces in the bilateral MTG was predicted by their proximity in trustworthiness-dominance space, an effect that could not be explained by mere visual similarity. This MTG trait-space representation occurred automatically, was relatively invariant across participants, and did not depend on the explicit endorsement of face impressions (i.e., beliefs that face impressions are valid and accurate). In contrast, regions involved in high-level social reasoning (the bilateral temporoparietal junction and posterior superior temporal sulcus; TPJ-pSTS) and entity-specific social knowledge (the left anterior temporal lobe; ATL) also exhibited this trait-space representation but only among participants who explicitly endorsed forming these impressions. Together, the findings identify a two-dimensional neural representation of face impressions and suggest that multiple implicit and explicit mechanisms give rise to biases based on facial appearance. While the MTG implicitly represents a multidimensional trait space for faces, the TPJ-pSTS and ATL are involved in the explicit application of this trait space for social evaluation and behavior.

AB The prevalence of chronic inflammation increases with age and may be aggravated by environmental exposures. Similarly, during immune aging, inflammatory disease incidence increases as protective immunity decreases. To better understand disease and exposure risks, an immune aging model outlining key changes in immune function is crucial. Utilizing the lowest possible vertebrate class, we propose the Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) as a model to investigate sex-specific immune aging including changes in immune gene expression, leukocyte profiles, and organismal level immune response. Evaluating the expression of immune initiators (CRP, TLR5-s, TLR5-m, TCRb, and MHCII), immune mediators (MYD88, Nf-k ss, C3, and IL1b), and immune effectors (LYZ and C8) in concomitance with alterations in leukocyte populations and host resistance to pathogens will inform about immune competence across ages. The data presented here demonstrate a critical decrease in the expression of immune initiators (CRP, TLR5-soluble, TCRb, and MHCII), mediators (MYD88, Nf-k ss, C3, and IL1b), and effector (LYZ) in both females and males after 11 months post hatching (mph). Interestingly, both sexes displayed an upregulation for the immune effector, C8, during this older life stage (11-13 mph). Gene expression profiles for both sexes at the most elderly age (20 or 23 mph) appear to revert to a younger profile of expression indicating a second change in immune function during aging rather than a steady decline. Significant changes in leukocyte populations were observed in both male and female medaka after peaking sexual maturation at 3 mph. Organismal level immune competence data revealed male medaka at the elderly age to be more vulnerable than their female and younger male counterparts while no differences were observed in females based on age. Together, these data provide a holistic profile for immune aging in medaka, a useful tool for future immunological studies considering age as a factor influencing disease susceptibility.

AB This study explores the impact of CaTiO3 and LiNbO3 crystals on the optical and dielectric properties of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) films. Our investigation employs UV-Visible Spectroscopy to characterize the n-pi* CF related electronic transition within the PVDF matrix. We find that CaTiO3 crystals significantly decrease the composite's band gap and dielectric properties, enhancing its electronic and optical attributes. Conversely, LiNbO3 crystals increase the band gap energy. These variations align with observed DC conductivity changes, suggesting novel functionalities for optoelectronic, sensing, and energy storage applications.

AB Single crystal Cr1.27Te2 samples were synthesized by using the chemical vapor transport method. Single crystal x-ray diffraction studies show a trigonal crystal structure with a P (3) over bar m1 symmetry space group. We then systematically investigate magnetic properties and critical behaviors of single crystal Cr1.27Te2 around its paramagnetic-to-ferromagnetic phase transition. The Arrott plot indicates a second-order magnetic phase transition. We estimate critical exponents beta = 0.2631 +/- 0.002, gamma = 1.2314 +/- 0.007, and T-C = 168.48 +/- 0.031 K by using the Kouvel-Fisher method. We also estimate other critical exponents delta = 5.31 +/- 0.004 by analyzing the critical isotherm at T-C = 168.5 K. We further verify the accuracy of our estimated critical exponents by the scaling analysis. Further analysis suggests that Cr1.27Te2 can be best described as a quasi-2D Ising magnetic system.

AB CO2 methanation presents a promising route to simultaneously reduce CO2 emissions and store renewable energy. Nickel supported on magnesium oxide (Ni-MgO) stands out as an effective catalyst for CO2 methanation, but suffers from low activity at temperatures below 300 degrees C. In this work, Ni-MgO prepared by a sol-gel method (Ni-MgO-SG) exhibited markedly higher activity at T <= 300 degrees C compared to catalysts prepared by other synthesis routes. Detailed characterizations revealed that the superior performance of the Ni-MgO-SG catalyst originated from smaller Ni nanoparticle size, higher surface area, higher low- and medium-strength basic sites, and abundant surface oxygen vacancies. The smaller Ni nanoparticles provided increased exposed active surface area, while the oxygen vacancies facilitated CO2 adsorption and activation at low temperatures. These features, combined with the intrinsic basicity of MgO and the moderate interactions between Ni and the support, led to a highly selective and stable catalyst that can operate at low temperatures. Overall, Ni-MgO-SG shows promise for sustainable fuel production processes.

AB Polymer degradation has many important applications, ranging from waste management and reuse of polymers, to targeted delivery in nanomedicine. Vinyl ketone (VK) polymers have efficient light driven degradation, due to Norrish chemistry inherent to them. The photodegradation of four RAFT-VK polymers: poly(phenyl vinyl ketone)-poly(PVK), poly(p-methoxy phenyl vinyl ketone)-poly(PVK-OMe), poly(p-chloro phenyl vinyl ketone)-poly(PVK-Cl), and poly(methyl vinyl ketone)-poly(MVK) was studied. Degradation kinetics were studied under different wavelengths (310, 350, 390, 450, 520 and 630 nm). All poly(PVK) systems showed a rapid degradation under 310 and 350 nm, yielding short oligomers with low molecular weights and broader molecular weight distributions, with minimal degradation under other wavelengths. Among the aromatic poly(VK)s, poly(PVK-Cl) with an electron-withdrawing chloro-group had the highest degradation rate, poly(PVK) had the second highest degradation rate, and poly(PVK-OMe) with an electron-donating methoxy-group had the lowest degradation rate at 350 nm. Photodegradation of poly(MVK) was substantially slower than all of the poly(PVK) derivatives. Using lower polymer concentration and higher targeted chain lengths led to a notable increase in the polymer degradation rate. A scaling model was developed to explain the chain scission events and to gain insight into the underlined degradation process. Finally, photodegradation influenced the thermal and surface properties of VK materials, with correlation between molecular changes and materials properties highlighting the potential to use these light responsive polymers to change the thermal and surface characteristics of materials.

AB Effective prioritization of issue reports in software engineering helps to optimize resource allocation and information recovery. However, manual issue classification is laborious and lacks scalability. As an alternative, many open source software (OSS) projects employ automated processes for this task, yet this relies on substantial datasets for adequate training. This research investigates an automated approach to issue classification based on Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT). By leveraging the capabilities of such models, we aim to develop a robust system for prioritizing issue reports accurately, mitigating the necessity for extensive training data while maintaining reliability. In our research, we have developed a GPT-based approach to label issues accurately with a reduced training dataset. By reducing reliance on massive data requirements and focusing on few-shot fine-tuning, we found a more accessible and efficient solution for issue classification. Our model predicted issue labels in individual projects up to 93.2% in precision, 95% in recall, and 89.3% in F1-score.

   absorption spectroscopy
AB The performance of organic donor-acceptor heterojunctions in solar cell devices is fundamentally determined by factors such as charge separation efficiency, charge carrier mobility, exciton diffusion lengths, and energy losses due to exciton recombination. Despite advancements in organic photovoltaic materials, exciton transport is frequently hindered by structural disorder, which limits overall device efficiency. Exciton-polaritons, formed through the strong coupling of cavity-coupled organic materials, exhibit delocalized states that enhance exciton transport and reduce the effects of disorder. Thus, it is of interest to elucidate the influence of strong coupling on charge transfer dynamics in organic photovoltaic materials. Using transient absorption spectroscopy, we explore the effect of cavity-strong-coupling in DBP-C70 donor-acceptor blends integrated with a distributed Bragg reflector cavity. We find that the presence of the cavity slows the charge transfer process in such heterojunction systems.

AB Subcell limiting strategies for discontinuous Galerkin spectral element methods do not provably satisfy a semi-discrete cell entropy inequality. In this work, we introduce an extension to the subcell and monolithic convex limiting strategies [12,11,2] that satisfies the semi-discrete cell entropy inequality by formulating the limiting factors as solutions to an optimization problem. The optimization problem is efficiently solved using a deterministic greedy algorithm. We also discuss the extension of the proposed subcell limiting strategy to preserve general convex constraints. Numerical experiments confirm that the proposed limiting strategy preserves high order accuracy for smooth solutions and satisfies the cell entropy inequality.

AB State laws have influenced access to abortion in the 50 years since Roe v. Wade. The 2022 Dobbs decision returned questions about the legality of abortion to the states, which increased the importance of state laws for abortion access. The objective of this study is to illustrate trends in abortion-restrictive and abortion-supportive state laws using a unique longitudinal database of reproductive health laws across the United States from 1994 to 2022. This study offers a descriptive analysis of historical trends in state-level pre-viability abortion bans, abortion method bans, efforts to dissuade abortion, TRAP (targeted regulation of abortion providers) laws, other laws that restrict reproductive choice, and laws that expand abortion access and support reproductive health. Data sources include state statutes (from Nexis Uni) and secondary sources. The data reveal that pre-viability bans, including gestation-based bans and total bans, became significantly more prevalent over time. Other abortion-restrictive laws increased from 1994 to 2022, but states also passed a growing number of laws that support reproductive health. Increasing polarization into abortion-restrictive and abortion-supportive states characterized the 1994-2022 period. These trends have implications for maternal and infant health and for racial/ethnic and income disparities.

AB The kinetics of photoinduced electron/energy transfer reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (PET-RAFT) polymerization were investigated using a model system of methyl acrylate (MA) in the presence of trithiocarbonate chain transfer agents and tris(2-phenylpyridine)iridium(III) (Ir(ppy)3) as the photocatalyst. A powerful polymerization through oxygen approach was developed. Efficient PET-RAFT occurred under blue, violet, and green light with catalyst loadings of 10 ppm. Minimal polymerization was observed under orange or red light. Kinetic scaling analysis was developed to evaluate the impact of light intensity, catalyst loading and geometry of both the light source and the reaction vessel. A universal scaling law was developed for Ir(ppy)3 and other energy transfer catalyzed PET-RAFT, allowing both polymerization through oxygen and deoxygenated systems from the literature to be described across a range of light intensities, reaction conditions and geometries. Finally, the scaling analysis indicates that PET-RAFT systems should be subject to less retardation than conventional RAFT systems, due to the chain transfer agent being involved in radical generation steps.

TI Enhancing performance of lithium metal batteries through acoustic field
   application
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A

ID SOLID-ELECTROLYTE INTERPHASE; ANODE; SEI
AB Cost-effective strategies for enhancing performance of lithium metal batteries (LMB) are in high demand. Herein, we propose and demonstrate that applying an external acoustic field can significantly enhance LMB performance, offering a novel approach to advancing battery technology. Long-term electrochemical stability tests, along with SEM and XPS characterization, reveal that this enhancement may result from the increased lithium-ion diffusion at slip lines and kinks, which can enable a more uniform solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. Without the acoustic field, lithium ions exhibit slower conduction through thicker SEI regions, influenced by slip lines and kinks. In contrast, the application of an acoustic field facilitates more uniform ion diffusion, thereby enhancing overall performance. This approach provides a valuable pathway for advancing battery technology beyond the traditional focus on material innovation.

AB The built environment requires extraction and consumption of enormous quantities of raw materials, water, and energy. While these materials remain in use for several years or decades, growing global populations and aging infrastructure are driving widespread generation of one of the largest and most challenging waste streams to manage. There is growing interest from communities in integrating circular economy (CE) strategies in the context of construction & demolition (C&D) material management. Many approaches for doing so focus on small-scale CE applications like individual products, materials, or projects. However, greater understanding is needed at the city-scale given communities' complex position at the frontlines of local development, resource consumption, and waste management. This study summarizes the development of an evaluative framework for community-based C&D circularity at a city or regional level. The framework expands upon a mixed methods approach called the Circularity Assessment Protocol (CAP), which integrates aspects of urban metabolism, geospatial analysis, and qualitative research methods to examine plastic waste management in communities. To advance convergent CE research, here, we aim to adapt the CAP framework to C&D. We describe our adaptation of the CAP to C&D through a conceptual review describing research, methods, and strategies related to seven elements of a local CE context: C&D Analytics, Building Material and Design, Community, Use, Collection, End-of-Cycle, and C&D Emissions. This work describes a novel yet preliminary conceptualization for developing a baseline understanding of circular C&D material management and a holistic examination of barriers, affordances, and opportunities for improving city-wide circularity.

AB Cybersickness continues to bar many individuals from taking full advantage of virtual reality (VR) technology. Previous work has established that navigating virtual terrain with elevation changes poses a significant risk in this regard. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of three cybersickness reduction strategies on users performing a navigation task across virtual elevation-altering terrain. These strategies include static field of view (FOV) reduction, a flat surface approach that disables terrain collision and maintains constant elevation for users, and SmoothRide, a novel technique designed to dampen a user's perception of vertical motion as they travel. To assess the impact of these strategies, we conducted a within-subjects study involving 61 participants. Each strategy was compared against a control condition, where users navigated across terrain without any cybersickness reduction measures in place. Cybersickness data were collected using the Fast Motion Sickness Scale (FMS) and Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ), along with galvanic skin response (GSR) data. We measured user presence using the IGroup Presence questionnaire (IPQ) and a Single-Item Presence Scale (SIP). Our findings reveal that users experienced significantly lower levels of cybersickness using SmoothRide or FOV reduction. Presence scores reported on the IPQ were statistically similar between SmoothRide and the control condition. Conversely, terrain flattening had adverse effects on user presence scores, and we could not identify a significant effect on cybersickness compared to the control. We demonstrate that SmoothRide is an effective, lightweight, configurable, and easy-to-integrate tool for reducing cybersickness in simulations featuring elevation-altering terrain.

SO SOFT MATTER
LA English
DT Article
ID SHEAR; MICROSTRUCTURE; RHEOLOGY; DYNAMICS; FLUIDS; MODEL
AB Particle dynamics simulations are used to study the startup flow of jammed soft particle suspensions in shear flow from a thermodynamic perspective. This thermodynamic framework is established using the concept of the two-body excess entropy extracted from the transient pair distribution function and elastic energy of the suspension as a function of strain at different shear rates and suspension volume fractions. Although the evolution of the elastic energy in these soft particle glasses closely mimics the stress-strain behavior at different shear rates and volume fractions, there are several differences corresponding to their overshoots in terms of the broadness and location of the peaks. The transient excess entropy shows an anisotropic behavior due to the anisotropic distribution of contacts at high shear rates. The excess entropy at high shear rates increases as a function of the strain and attains a steady state. On the other hand, it is nearly constant and isotropic in the quasi-static regime, where the stress response is close to the dynamic yield stress. Using the transient elastic energy and excess entropy, a transient temperature is defined to establish a relationship between thermodynamics and the static yield stress data. This transient temperature increases with the strain and then diverges at strains close to the static yield point at high shear rates.
   Structural anisotropy in shear flow and its effect on the excess entropy of soft pastes.

AB Diverse communities of fungal endophytes reside in plant tissues, where they affect and are affected by plant physiology and ecology. For these intimate interactions to form and persist, endophytes and their host plants engage in intricate systems of communication. The conversation between fungal endophytes and plant hosts ultimately dictates endophyte community composition and function and has cascading effects on plant health and plant interactions. In this review, we synthesize our current knowledge on the mechanisms and strategies of communication used by endophytic fungi and their plant hosts. We discuss the molecular mechanisms of communication that lead to organ specificity of endophytic communities and distinguish endophytes, pathogens, and saprotrophs. We conclude by offering emerging perspectives on the relevance of plant-endophyte communication to microbial community ecology and plant health and function.

AB This work investigates relationships between consistent attendance -attendance rates in a group that maintains the same tutor and students across the school year- and learning in small group tutoring sessions. We analyzed data from two large urban districts consisting of 206 9th-grade student groups (3 - 6 students per group) for a total of 803 students and 75 tutors. The students attended small group tutorials approximately every other day during the school year and completed a pre and post-assessment of math skills at the start and end of the year, respectively. First, we found that the attendance rates of the group predicted individual assessment scores better than the individual attendance rates of students comprising that group. Second, we found that groups with high consistent attendance had more frequent and diverse tutor and student talk centering around rich mathematical discussions. Whereas we emphasize that changing tutors or groups might be necessary, our findings suggest that consistently attending tutorial sessions as a group with the same tutor might lead the group to implicitly learn as a team despite not being one.

AB Fault-tolerant control of a quadrotor in extreme conditions, such as rotor failure and strong winds, is exceptionally challenging due to its underactuated nature, strong mismatched disturbances, and highly nonlinear multi-input and multi-output properties. This letter proposes a reduced attitude control approach that combines a model-based extended state observer (MB-ESO) and mismatched disturbance decoupling to control a quadrotor under strong winds and complete loss of two opposing rotors. Our MB-ESO based control provides a new theoretical framework for more general nonlinear systems by utilizing all measurable outputs, thereby maximizing the use of all available information to design a robust controller. Testing in a high-fidelity simulator shows that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion method.

AB Computational thinking, and by extension, computer programming, is notoriously challenging to learn. Conversational agents and generative artificial intelligence (genAI) have the potential to facilitate this learning process by offering personalized guidance, interactive learning experiences, and code generation. However, current genAI-based chatbots focus on professional developers and may not adequately consider educational needs. Involving educators in conceiving educational tools is critical for ensuring usefulness and usability. We enlisted nine instructors to engage in design fiction sessions in which we elicited abilities such a conversational agent supported by genAI should display. Participants envisioned a conversational agent that guides students stepwise through exercises, tuning its method of guidance with an awareness of the educational background, skills and deficits, and learning preferences. The insights obtained in this paper can guide future implementations of tutoring conversational agents oriented toward teaching computational thinking and computer programming.

AB While students can learn both chemistry content and inquiry practices by participating in course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs), it is well documented that prior experiences shape perception. We conducted a case study to investigate students' first experiences with a CURE in an upper-division chemical engineering laboratory course, drawing upon interviews (n = 6), field notes, and written reflections (N = 31). We used discourse analysis to characterize students' agency as they navigated their uncertainty and made sense of the authentic research. We found that students' past experiences shaped their expectations about the CURE, with some wishing for traditional learning supports misaligned to CUREs. Offering students constrained yet consequential agency allowed them to recognize the authentic supports that were available, including help-seeking as itself a form of agency; understand failure as endemic to research rather than their own shortcoming; and position themselves as capable of navigating the uncertainty as a community of researchers. Our results suggest that instructors should model uncertainty and failure as endemic to research and position students as valued collaborators and support for overcoming abundant prior experiences with cookbook-style experiments.

AB This work demonstrates quasi-vertical GaN Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) on 6-inch Si substrate with a breakdown voltage (BV) over 1 kV, the highest BV reported in vertical GaN-on-Si SBDs to date. The deep mesa inherently in quasi-vertical devices is leveraged to form a self-aligned edge termination, and the mesa sidewall is covered by the p-type nickel oxide (NiO) as a reduced surface field (RESURF) structure. This novel termination enables a parallel-plane junction electric field of 2.8 MV/cm. The device also shows low turn-on voltage of 0.5 V, and low specific on-resistance of 1.1 mO.cm(2). Moreover, the device exhibits excellent overvoltage robustness under the continuous 800 V stress in the unclamped inductive switching test. These results show the good promise of the low-cost vertical GaN-on-Si power diodes.

AB Cyberattacks are becoming more frequent and sophisticated, and investigating them becomes more challenging. Provenance graphs are the primary data source to support forensics analysis. Because of system complexity and long attack duration, provenance graphs can be huge, and efficiently storing them remains a challenging problem. Existing works typically use relational or graph databases to store provenance graphs. These solutions suffer from high storage overhead and low query efficiency. Recently, researchers leveraged Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in storage system design and achieved promising results. We observe that DNNs can embed given inputs as context-aware numerical vector representations, which are compact and support parallel query operations. In this paper, we propose to learn a DNN as the storage system for provenance graphs to achieve storage and query efficiency. We also present novel designs that leverage domain knowledge to reduce provenance data redundancy and build fast-query processing with indexes. We built a prototype LEONARD and evaluated it on 12 datasets. Compared with the relational database Quickstep and the graph database Neo4j, LEONARD reduced the space overhead by up to 25.90x and boosted up to 99.6% query executions.

ID KNOWLEDGE DISTILLATION
AB Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved notable success in many speech processing tasks, but the large model size and heavy computational cost hinder the deployment. Knowledge distillation trains a small student model to mimic the behavior of a large teacher model. However, the student architecture usually needs to be manually designed and will remain fixed during training, which requires prior knowledge and can lead to suboptimal performance. Inspired by recent success of task-specific structured pruning, we propose DPHuBERT, a novel task-agnostic compression method for speech SSL based on joint distillation and pruning. Experiments on SUPERB show that DPHuBERT outperforms pure distillation methods in almost all tasks. Moreover, DPHuBERT requires little training time and performs well with limited training data, making it suitable for resource-constrained applications. Our method can also be applied to various speech SSL models. Our code and models will be publicly available.

AB Promoting inclusive communication is essential and sign language plays a crucial role in achieving this goal. In this research, a system is developed capable of making it easier for those who primarily communicate through sign language to interact with those who are unable or may not be knowledgeable in the language. This has the potential to help bridge the communication gap between those who arc fluent in sign language, and those who may be struggling to learn or are not knowledgeable. In its current state, our system is capable of recognizing two forms of sign language, namely: American Sign Language and British Sign Language. The system also is capable of performing facial expression analysis to account for nonverbal inflections expressed by the user. These tasks are accomplished by making use of computer vision provided by the OpenCV Python library. It also uses various machine learning models and the MediaPipe library. We explore two approaches for sign language recognition: contour-based recognition and landmark-based recognition. Additionally, facial landmarks for facial expression analysis are investigated which can be used to detect expressions and inflections from a user's face alone. The next steps of this research will consist of working with more complex words and phrases and investigating gesture recognition.

AB Background: Many members of Black American communities, faced with the high prevalence of Alzheimer disease and dementias (ADRD) within their demographic, find themselves taking on the role of informal caregivers. Despite being the primary individuals responsible for the care of individuals with ADRD, these caregivers often lack sufficient knowledge about ADRD-related health literacy and feel ill-prepared for their caregiving responsibilities. GenerativeAI has becomea new promising technological innovation in the health care domain, particularly for improving health literacy; however, some generative AI developments might lead to increased bias and potential harm toward Black American communities. Therefore, rigorous development generative AI tools to support the Black American community is needed. Objective: The goal of this study is to test Lola, a multimodal mobile app, which, by relying on generativeAI, facilitates to ADRD-related health information by enabling speech and text as inputs and providing auditory, textual, and visual outputs. Methods: To test our mobile app, we used the cognitive walk-through methodology, and we recruited 15 informal ADRD caregivers who were older than 50 years and part of the Black American community living within the region. We asked them perform 3 tasks on the mobile app (ie, searching for an article on brain health, searching for local events, and finally, searching for opportunities to participate in scientific research in their area), then we recorded their opinions and impressions. The aspects to be evaluated were the mobile app's usability, accessibility, cultural relevance, and adoption. Results: Our findings highlight the users' need for a system that enables interaction with different modalities, the need system that can provide personalized and culturally and contextually relevant information, and the role of community and physical spaces in increasing the use of Lola. Conclusions:Our study shows that, when designing for Black American older adults, a multimodal interaction with thegenerative AI system can allow individuals to choose their own interaction way and style based upon their interaction preferences external constraints. This flexibility of interaction modes can guarantee an inclusive and engaging generative AI experience.

AB A graph short-time Fourier transform is defined using the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian and a graph heat kernel as a window parametrized by a nonnegative time parameter t . We show that the corresponding Gabor-like system forms a frame for C d and gives a description of the spectrum of the corresponding frame operator in terms of the graph heat kernel and the spectrum of the underlying graph Laplacian. For two classes of algebraic graphs, we prove the frame is tight and independent of the window parameter t . (c) 2024 Elsevier Inc.

TI Community-based propagation to scale up educational innovations in
   sustainability
SO NATURE SUSTAINABILITY
LA English
DT Article
ID MODEL; SCIENCE
AB Many high-quality educational innovations are freely available, and some are known to motivate evidence-based climate and sustainability action. Typically, efforts to propagate educational innovations rely on outreach and word-of-mouth diffusion, but these approaches tend to achieve little. We develop and analyse a dynamic computational model to understand why and to test other propagation strategies. Our analysis reveals that outreach has limited impact and does little to accelerate word-of-mouth adoption under conditions typical in higher education. Instead, we find that community-based propagation can rapidly accelerate adoption, as is also shown by a small number of successful real-world scaling efforts. This approach supports a community of 'ambassadors', facilitating and rewarding their sharing the innovation with potential adopters. Community-based propagation can generate exponential growth in adopters, rapidly outpacing outreach and word-of-mouth propagation. Without it, we are unlikely to rapidly scale the educational innovations needed to build urgently needed capacity in sustainability.
   Innovative educational methods can be difficult to spread across universities and instructors. This study examines the best routes to rapidly scale new methods in sustainability education.

AB This paper proposes a new paradigm of extreme manufacturing from the temporal perspective in contrast to the current extreme manufacturing paradigm based on length scales (e.g., from nanometer to close-to-atom). The advent of 5 G and future 6 G (NextG) wireless communication provides unique capabilities of ultra-low end-toend (E2E) latency (similar to 1 ms), high speed (up to 20 Gb/s), high reliability (>99.999 %), and high flexibility (wireless) to meet the stringent requirements of future manufacturing. The ultra-low E2E latency enables NextG Manufacturing - a new extreme manufacturing paradigm from the latency perspective. This positioning paper identifies the needs of NextG manufacturing, introduces the characteristics of NextG wireless communication networks, proposes a framework for NextG manufacturing, demonstrates use cases, summarizes current challenges, and provides an outlook for future research directions.

ID ON-SCALAR REGRESSION; MIXED MODELS; PRIORS
AB Functional mixed models are widely useful for regression analysis with dependent functional data, including longitudinal functional data with scalar predictors. However, existing algorithms for Bayesian inference with these models only provide either scalable computing or accurate approximations to the posterior distribution, but not both. We introduce a new MCMC sampling strategy for highly efficient and fully Bayesian regression with longitudinal functional data. Using a novel blocking structure paired with an orthogonalized basis reparameterization, our algorithm jointly samples the fixed effects regression functions together with all subject- and replicate-specific random effects functions. Crucially, the joint sampler optimizes sampling efficiency for these key parameters while preserving computational scalability. Perhaps surprisingly, our new MCMC sampling algorithm even surpasses state-of-the-art algorithms for frequentist estimation and variational Bayes approximations for functional mixed models-while also providing accurate posterior uncertainty quantification-and is orders of magnitude faster than existing Gibbs samplers. Simulation studies show improved point estimation and interval coverage in nearly all simulation settings over competing approaches. We apply our method to a large physical activity dataset to study how various demographic and health factors associate with intraday activity. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.

AB Background: In addition to the benefits of a diverse faculty, many institutions are under pressure from students and administrators to increase the number of faculty from historically excluded backgrounds. Despite increases in the numbers of engineering PhD earners from these groups, the percentages of Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino tenure-track faculty have not increased, and the percentage of women remains low. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to identify how experiences in graduate school encourage or deter PhD earners from historically excluded groups in pursuing an engineering academic career. Method: We conducted 20 semi-structured interviews with engineering PhD students and recent graduates, with half of participants interested and half disinterested in pursuing an academic career after graduation. Results: Three key factors emerged as strongly influential on participants' desire to pursue an academic career: their relationship with their advisor, their perception of their advisor's work-life balance, and their perception of the culture of academia. Participants extrapolated their experiences in graduate school to their imagined lives as faculty. The results illuminate the reasons why engineering PhD earners from historically underrepresented groups remain in or leave the academic career pathway after graduate school. Conclusions: The findings of this study have important implications for how graduate students' and postdoc's relationships with their advisors as well as perceptions of their advisors' work-life balances and the culture of academia affect future faculty. We make recommendations on what students, faculty, and administrators can do to create a more inclusive environment to encourage students from historically excluded groups to consider academic careers.

TI Co-Exploring Structured Sparsification and Low-Rank Tensor Decomposition
   for Compact DNNs
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Model compression; sparsification; tensor decomposition
AB Sparsification and low-rank decomposition are two important techniques to compress deep neural network (DNN) models. To date, these two popular yet distinct approaches are typically used in separate ways; while their efficient integration for better compression performance is little explored, especially for structured sparsification and decomposition. In this article, we perform systematic co-exploration on structured sparsification and decomposition toward compact DNN models. We first investigate and analyze several important design factors for joint structured sparsification and decomposition, including operational sequence, decomposition format, and optimization procedure. Based on the observations from our analysis, we then propose CEPD, a unified DNN compression framework that can co-explore the benefits of structured sparsification and tensor decomposition in an efficient way. Empirical experiments demonstrate the promising performance of our proposed solution. Notably, on the CIFAR-10 dataset, CEPD brings 0.72%-0.45% accuracy increase over the baseline ResNet-56 and MobileNetV2 models, respectively, and meanwhile, the computational costs are reduced by 43.0%-44.2%, respectively. On the ImageNet dataset, our approach can enable 0.10%-1.39% accuracy increase over the baseline ResNet-18 and ResNet-50 models with 59.4%-54.6% fewer parameters, respectively.

TI Gapless symmetry-protected topological phases and generalized deconfined
   critical points from gauging a finite subgroup
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
LA English
DT Article
ID QUANTUM; SUPERFLUID; INSULATOR; SYSTEMS
AB Gauging a finite subgroup of a global symmetry can map conventional phases and phase transitions to unconventional ones. In this work, we study, as a concrete example, an emergent Z 2 -gauged system with global symmetry U(1), namely, the Z 2 -gauged Bose -Hubbard model both in 1D and in 2D. In certain limits, there is an emergent mixed 't Hooft anomaly between the quotient U (1) symmetry and the dual superfluid phase is mapped to an intrinsically gapless symmetry -protected topological (SPT) phase, as supported by density -matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations. In 2D, the original superfluid-insulator transition becomes a generalized deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) between a gapless SPT phase, where an SPT order coexists with Goldstone modes, and a U (1) -symmetry -enriched topological (SET) phase. We also discuss the stability of these phases and the critical points to small perturbations and their potential experimental realizations. Our work demonstrates that partial gauging is a simple and yet powerful approach in constructing novel phases and quantum criticalities.

ID TOPOLOGICAL DEFECTS; CELL
AB Monolayers of growing bacteria, confined within channel geometries, exhibit self-organization into a highly aligned laminar state along the axis of the channel. Although this phenomenon has been observed in experiments and simulations under various boundary conditions, the underlying physical mechanism driving this alignment remains unclear. In this study, we conduct simulations of growing bacteria in two-dimensional channel geometries perturbed by fixed obstacles, either circular or arc shaped, placed at the channel's center. Our findings reveal that even sizable obstacles cause only short -ranged disruptions to the baseline laminar state. These disruptions arise from a competition between local planar anchoring and bulk laminar alignment. At smaller obstacle sizes, bulk alignment fully dominates, while at larger sizes planar anchoring induces increasing local disruptions. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that the resulting configurations of the bacterial system display a striking resemblance to the arrangement of hard-rod smectic liquid crystals around circular obstacles. This suggests that modeling hard-rod bacterial monolayers as smectic, rather than nematic, liquid crystals may yield successful outcomes. The insights gained from our study contribute to the expanding body of research on bacterial growth in channels. Our work provides perspectives on the stability of the laminar state and extends our understanding to encompass more intricate confinement schemes.

AB Ultrasound-directed self-assembly (DSA) uses ultrasound waves to organize and orient particles dispersed in a fluid medium into specific patterns. Combining ultrasound DSA with vat photopolymerization (VP) enables manufacturing materials layer-by-layer, wherein each layer the organization and orientation of particles in the photopolymer is controlled, which enables tailoring the properties of the resulting composite materials. However, the particle packing density changes with time and location as particles organize into specific patterns. Hence, relating the ultrasound DSA process parameters to the transient local particle packing density is important to tailor the properties of the composite material, and to determine the maximum speed of the layer-by-layer VP process. This paper theoretically derives and experimentally validates a 3D ultrasound DSA model and evaluates the local particle packing density at locations where particles assemble as a function of time and ultrasound DSA process parameters. The particle packing density increases with increasing particle volume fraction, decreasing particle size, and decreasing fluid medium viscosity is determined. Increasing the particle size and decreasing the fluid medium viscosity decreases the time to reach steady-state. This work contributes to using ultrasound DSA and VP as a materials manufacturing process.

AB Social virtual reality (VR) serves as a vital platform for transgender individuals to explore their identities through avatars and foster personal connections within online communities. However, it presents a challenge: the disconnect between avatar embodiment and voice representation, often leading to misgendering and harassment. Prior research acknowledges this issue but overlooks the potential solution of voice changers. We interviewed 13 transgender and gender-nonconforming users of social VR platforms, focusing on their experiences with and without voice changers. We found that using a voice changer not only reduces voice-related harassment, but also allows them to experience gender euphoria through both hearing their modified voice and the reactions of others to their modified voice, motivating them to pursue voice training and medication to achieve desired voices. Furthermore, we identified the technical barriers to current voice changer technology and potential improvements to alleviate the problems that transgender and gender-nonconforming users face.

AB Federated learning (FL) emerges as a promising solution to train machine learning (ML) models from distributed data sources. In FL, the heterogeneous and imbalanced data distribution of local clients could severely hurt the fairness of the aggregated global model. In this paper, we identify two key obstacles of developing fair FL models w.r.t. the global distribution: the domain shifts from local clients to the global data distribution and the fairness heterogeneity across local clients. Therefore, considering these two obstacles, we present a novel fairness-aware FL training framework Robust-Fair Domain Smoothing (RFDS) to address the bias issue of FL models from a unique domain-shifting perspective. In particular, we design two novel components to build RFDS: 1) local robust-fair training, and 2) reference domain smoothing. Local robust-fair training aims to train robust-fair local models whose fairness is robust against the domain shifts from local distributions to the global distribution. Reference domain smoothing reduces the heterogeneity of fairness across clients to improve the fairness of the aggregated global model. We further provide a theoretical analysis to show the connection between the domain discrepancy of local data distributions and the heterogeneity of fairness across clients. Empirical evaluation results on multiple real-world datasets show that RFDS achieves promising performance gains in improving demographic fairness compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

AB Despite significant advances in machine learning (ML) applications within science, there is a notable gap in its integration into K-12 education to enhance data literacy and scientific inquiry (SI) skills. To address this gap, we enable K-12 teachers with limited technical expertise to apply ML for pattern discovery and explore how ML can empower educators in teaching SI. We design a web-based tool, ML4SI, for teachers to create ML-supported SI learning activities. This tool can also facilitate collecting data about the interaction between ML techniques and SI learning. A pilot study with three K-12 teachers provides insights to prepare the next generation for the era of big data through ML-supported SI learning.

AB Growth mindset interventions directed at students aim to change students' beliefs about the malleability of ability. These interventions have had mixed results, with some showing impressive findings (e.g., improving grades and persistence in science and closing performance gaps), while other implementations have shown null findings. This heterogeneity suggests that growth mindset interventions should not be viewed as a sole solution for improving educational outcomes for students and that further research is needed to identify the contextual factors that influence their effectiveness. We propose new theoretical directions in mindset research that adopts an anti-deficit model and moves away from focusing exclusively on students and their belief systems. Instead, we encourage a new wave of mindset research that considers the institutional, cultural, and contextual environment that either corroborates or negates students' mindset beliefs. We propose a new approach to mindset research that emphasizes innovative approaches to better understand the conditions under which mindset interventions are effective.

AB 'Scale the model, scale the data, scale the compute' is the reigning sentiment in the world of generative AI today. While the impact of model scaling has been extensively studied, we are only beginning to scratch the surface of data scaling and its consequences. This is especially of critical importance in the context of vision-language datasets such as LAION. These datasets are continually growing in size and are built based on large-scale internet dumps such as the Common Crawl, which is known to have numerous drawbacks ranging from quality, legality, and content. The datasets then serve as the backbone for large generative models, contributing to the operationalization and perpetuation of harmful societal and historical biases and stereotypes. In this paper, we investigate the effect of scaling datasets on hateful content through a comparative audit of two datasets: LAION-400M and LAION-2B. Our results show that hate content increased by nearly 12% with dataset scale, measured both qualitatively and quantitatively using a metric that we term as Hate Content Rate (HCR). We also found that filtering dataset contents based on Not Safe ForWork (NSFW) values calculated based on images alone does not exclude all the harmful content in alt-text. Instead, we found that trace amounts of hateful, targeted, and aggressive text remain even when carrying out conservative filtering. We end with a reflection and a discussion of the significance of our results for dataset curation and usage in the AI community. Code and the meta-data assets curated in this paper are publicly available at https://github.com/vinayprabhu/hate_scaling. Content warning: This paper contains examples of hateful text that might be disturbing, distressing, and/or offensive.

AB The Sun constantly releases radiation and plasma into the heliosphere. Sporadically, the Sun launches solar eruptions such as flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). CMEs carry away a huge amount of mass and magnetic flux with them. An Earth-directed CME can cause serious consequences to the human system. It can destroy power grids/pipelines, satellites, and communications. Therefore, accurately monitoring and predicting CMEs is important to minimize damages to the human system. In this study we propose an ensemble learning approach, named CMETNet, for predicting the arrival time of CMEs from the Sun to the Earth. We collect and integrate eruptive events from two solar cycles, #23 and #24, from 1996 to 2021 with a total of 363 geoeffective CMEs. The data used for making predictions include CME features, solar wind parameters and CME images obtained from the SOHO/LASCO C2 coronagraph. Our ensemble learning framework comprises regression algorithms for numerical data analysis and a convolutional neural network for image processing. Experimental results show that CMETNet performs better than existing machine learning methods reported in the literature, with a Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient of 0.83 and a mean absolute error of 9.75 h.

ID GENDER; IDENTITY; COLOR
AB Despite knowing physics and astronomy doctoral programs are laden with identity-based inequities, they continue to push minoritized students to the margins. This qualitative social network analysis of 100 women and/or lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and more (LGBT+) physics and astronomy Ph.D.'s explores how minoritized physics and astronomy students utilize social networks to navigate departmental exclusion. Our findings indicate that many of the participants' identities were often unacknowledged or negatively addressed within their graduate education, with only four participants reporting a positive or favorable experience during this period of their career. Direct support from peers, faculty, and identity-based affinity groups was necessary for participants to navigate their educations. This study demonstrated that generic best practices often cannot fully support the diverse range of persons who come to physics and that identity-neutral values in physics further isolate students by insinuating that their own minoritized experiences are not valid.

AB BackgroundThis systematic review of the literature on Latin & eacute;/x/a/o students in engineering was motivated by the recent increase in interest and thus scholarship about this population and the need for a nuanced understanding of the population's diversity.PurposeThis article's purpose is to provide a basis for critically exploring how heterogeneity within the Latin & eacute;/x/a/o engineering student population-and across the spectrum of pre-college to graduate school-is used in engineering educational scholarship. The following research question is addressed: "How is the diversity within Latin & eacute; engineering students exemplified in the engineering education literature?"Scope/MethodThis work was guided by a liberative approach as the driving framework to review and synthesize literature published in peer-reviewed journal articles from 2005 to 2018 that met the following inclusion criteria: (i) population of interest included Latin & eacute;s; (ii) focused on engineering or included engineering within the larger STEM; and (iii) studied K-20 education.ResultsSixty-nine studies were reviewed and synthesized. Key findings include an insufficient focus on Latin & eacute; students, an increased use of purposeful and critical theoretical frameworks, and a lack of demographics used to present a nuanced understanding of Latin & eacute; students in engineering.ConclusionsWe conclude that contextualized demographics should be included which enable analysis that provides nuanced understandings of Latin & eacute; students in engineering. While there is increased interest within engineering education to work with Latin & eacute; students, our findings point to the need of ensuring that research is conducted with cultural sensitivity, accuracy, and a nuanced understanding of the lived experiences of Latin & eacute; individuals.

TI FRAMM: Fair ranking with missing modalities for clinical trial site
   selection
SO PATTERNS
LA English
DT Article
ID DIVERSITY
AB The underrepresentation of gender, racial, and ethnic minorities in clinical trials is a problem undermining the efficacy of treatments on minorities and preventing precise estimates of the effects within these subgroups. We propose FRAMM, a deep reinforcement learning framework for fair trial site selection to help address this problem. We focus on two real -world challenges: the data modalities used to guide selection are often incomplete for many potential trial sites, and the site selection needs to simultaneously optimize for both enrollment and diversity. To address the missing data challenge, FRAMM has a modality encoder with a masked crossattention mechanism for bypassing missing data. To make efficient trade-offs, FRAMM uses deep reinforcement learning with a reward function designed to simultaneously optimize for both enrollment and fairness. We evaluate FRAMM using real -world historical clinical trials and show that it outperforms the leading baseline in enrollment -only settings while also greatly improving diversity.

AB The threat of rapidly spreading health misinformation through social media during crises like COVID-19 emphasizes the importance of addressing both clear falsehoods and complex misinformation, including conspiracy theories and subtle distortions. This paper designs a novel tripartite collective intelligence approach that integrates deep neural networks (DNNs), large language models (LLMs), and crowdsourced human intelligence (HI) to collaboratively detect complex forms of public health misinformation on social media. Our design is inspired by the collaborative strengths of DNNs, LLMs, and HI, which complement each other. We observe that DNNs efficiently handle large datasets for initial misinformation screening but struggle with complex content and rely on high-quality training data. LLMs enhance misinformation detection with improved language understanding but may sometimes provide eloquent yet factually incorrect explanations, risking misinformation mislabeling. HI provides critical thinking and ethical judgment superior to DNNs and LLMs but is slower and more costly in misinformation detection. In particular, we develop TriIntel, a tripartite collaborative intelligence framework that leverages the collective intelligence of DNNs, LLMs, and HI to tackle the public health information detection problem under a novel few-shot and uncertainty-aware maximum likelihood estimation framework. Evaluation results on a real-world public health misinformation detection application related to COVID-19 show that TriIntel outperforms representative DNNs, LLMs, and human-AI collaboration baselines in accurately detecting public health misinformation under a diverse set of evaluation scenarios.

TI Semantic similarity measure of natural language text through machine

   study using UCGIS GIS&T body of knowledge
SO TRANSACTIONS IN GIS
LA English
DT Article
AB Initiated by the University Consortium of Geographic Information Science (UCGIS), the GIS&T Body of Knowledge (BoK) is a community-driven endeavor to define, develop, and document geospatial topics related to geographic information science and technologies (GIS&T). In recent years, GIS&T BoK has undergone rigorous development in terms of its topic re-organization and content updating, resulting in a new digital version of the project. While the BoK topics provide useful materials for researchers and students to learn about GIS, the semantic relationships among the topics, such as semantic similarity, should also be identified so that a better and automated topic navigation can be achieved. Currently, the related topics are either defined manually by editors or authors, which may result in an incomplete assessment of topic relationships. To address this challenge, our research evaluates the effectiveness of multiple natural language processing (NLP) techniques in extracting semantics from text, including both deep neural networks and traditional machine learning approaches. Besides, a novel text summarization-KACERS (Keyword-Aware Cross-Encoder-Ranking Summarizer)-is proposed to generate a semantic summary of scientific publications. By identifying the semantic linkages among key topics, this work guides the future development and content organization of the GIS&T BoK project. It also offers a new perspective on the use of machine learning techniques for analyzing scientific publications and demonstrates the potential of the KACERS summarizer in semantic understanding of long text documents.

AB Scoring divergent thinking tasks opens multiple avenues and possibilities-decisions researchers have to make. While some scholars postulate that scoring should focus on the best ideas provided, the measurement of the best responses (e.g., "top scoring") comes along with challenges. More specifically, compared to the average quality across all responses, top scoring uses less information-the "bad" ideas are thrown away-which decreases reliability. To resolve this issue, this article introduces a multidimensional top-scoring approach analogous to linear growth modeling which retains information provided by all responses (best ideas and "bad" ideas). Across two studies, using both subjective human ratings and semantic distance originality scoring of responses to over a dozen divergent thinking tasks, we demonstrated that Maximum (the best idea) and Top2 Scoring (two best ideas) could surpass typically applied average scoring in measurement precision when the "bad" ideas' originality is used as auxiliary information (i.e., additional information in the analysis). We thus recommend retaining all ideas when scoring divergent thinking tasks, and we discuss the potential this new approach holds for creativity research and practice.

AB DNA short read alignment task has become a major sequential bottleneck to humongous amounts of data generated by next-generation sequencing platforms. In this paper, an energy-efficient and high-throughput Processing-in-Memory (PIM) accelerator based on DRAM (named Aligner-D) is presented to execute DNA short-read alignment with the state-of-the-art BWT alignment algorithm. We first present the PIM design that utilizes DRAM's internal high parallelism and throughput. It converts each DRAM array to a potent processing unit for alignment tasks. The proposed Aligner-D can efficiently execute the bulk bit-wise XNOR-based matching operation required by the alignment task with only 3-transistor/col overhead. We then introduce a highly parallel and customized read alignment algorithm based on BWT that supports both exact and inexact match tasks. Next, we present how to map the correlated data of the alignment task to utilize the parallelism from both new hardware and algorithm maximumly. The experimental results demonstrate that Aligner-D obtains $\sim 4\times $ , $\sim 2.45\times $ , $\sim 3.26\times $ , and $\sim 1.65\times $ improvement, respectively, compared with other in-memory computing platforms: Ambit (Seshadri et al., 2017), DRISA-1T1C (Li et al., 2017), DRISA-3T1C (Li et al., 2017), and ReDRAM (Angizi and Fan, 2019). As for DNA short read alignment, Aligner-D boosts the alignment throughput per Watt by $\sim 20104\times $ , $\sim 3522\times $ , $\sim 927\times $ , $\sim 88\times $ , $\sim 5.28\times $ , and $\sim 2.34\times $ , over ReCAM, CPU, GPU, FPGA, Ambit, and DRISA, respectively.

AB Nonprofit organizations (NPOs) lack resources, hindering the quality and quantity of service they can deliver. Meanwhile, NPOs at times have underutilized or even spare resources due to the inability to scale expertise in staffing and tangible resources to meet temporally shifting service demands. These observations motivate us to propose a novel resource sharing system, SWAP, which to the best of our knowledge, is the first resource sharing system that facilitates resource exchanges where NPOs can obtain resources by offering their own. SWAP consists of four elements: a collaborative auction-based sharing process, complete with an offering mechanism, a bidding mechanism, and the virtual currency, SWAP-credit, to facilitate liquidity in exchange; a central technology that represents the award determination problem with a multilateral exchange optimization model, generating resource exchange outcomes; an online platform, the SWAP Hub, where NPOs can offer and bid on available resources, and receive exchange results; and human-centric co-design, shaping the understanding and design decisions of a research collective, that includes the authors and NPO professionals. We conduct a series of experiments using both empirical and simulated data to illustrate the benefits and potential of SWAP. Our results demonstrate that SWAP can address temporal resource needs in practice; show that optimal exchange outcomes can be generated even for large-scale SWAP markets; and provide strong evidence in support of guidance to inform the progression for future versions of SWAP. The SWAP system is presently implemented in Howard County, MD, USA, with ongoing enhancements and potential for future expansion.

AB This paper presents a method that uses neural networks as a caching mechanism to reduce the variance of Monte Carlo Partial Differential Equation solvers, such as the Walk-on-Spheres algorithm [Sawhney and Crane 2020]. While these Monte Carlo PDE solvers have the merits of being unbiased and discretization-free, their high variance often hinders real-time applications. On the other hand, neural networks can approximate the PDE solution, and evaluating these networks at inference time can be very fast. However, neural-network-based solutions may suffer from convergence difficulties and high bias. Our hybrid system aims to combine these two potentially complementary solutions by training a neural field to approximate the PDE solution using supervision from a WoS solver. This neural field is then used as a cache in the WoS solver to reduce variance during inference. We demonstrate that our neural field training procedure is better than the commonly used self-supervised objectives in the literature. We also show that our hybrid solver exhibits lower variance than WoS with the same computational budget: it is significantly better for small compute budgets and provides smaller improvements for larger budgets, reaching the same performance as WoS in the limit.

AB Social sensing has become a critical source to obtain timely observations of emergent crisis events at an unprecedented scale by exploring the social media data contributed by common citizens. This paper focuses on an AI-powered crisis situation awareness (ACSA) application in social sensing that aims to obtain accurate situation awareness of emergent crisis events by leveraging advanced AI techniques and social sensing data. In particular, we study a cross-event quality-of-service (C-QoS) problem in ACSA applications where the goal is to address the limitation of current AI models that are often optimized only for a single crisis event and lack the generality to provide desirable QoS across different events. This paper explores the integration of AI and crowdsourced human intelligence as a solution to address the limitation in tackling the problem of C-QoS. However, two critical challenges exist: 1) it is challenging to optimize the ACSA model's C-QoS without sacrificing its specificity on each studied crisis event; 2) it is non-trivial to integrate the diversified AI and human intelligence to optimize C-QoS in ACSA applications. To combat these challenges, we introduce CrossGeneral, a subjective logic-driven human-AI collective learning framework that jointly leverages the specificity of AI and the generality of human intelligence to provide robust and accurate ACSA performance across different types of crisis events. Through evaluations performed on two real-world ACSA applications, CrossGeneral exhibits superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines by substantially enhancing the C-QoS of ACSA models.

AB Persistent shifts to undesired ecological states, such as shifts from coral to macroalgae, are becoming more common. This highlights the need to understand processes that can help restore affected ecosystems. Herbivory on coral reefs is widely recognized as a key interaction that can keep macroalgae from outcompeting coral. Most attention has been on the role 'grazing' herbivores play in preventing the establishment of macroalgae, while less research has focused on the role of 'browsers' in extirpating macroalgae. Here we explored patterns, environmental correlates and state shift consequences of spatial co-variation in grazing and browsing functions of herbivorous fishes. Grazing and browsing rates were not highly correlated across 20 lagoon sites in Moorea, French Polynesia, but did cluster into 3 (of 4) combinations of high and low consumption rates (no site had low grazing but high browsing). Consumption rates were not correlated with grazer or browser fish biomass, but both were predicted by specific environmental variables. Experiments revealed that reversibility of a macroalgal state shift was strongly related to spatial variation in browsing intensity. Our findings provide insights and simple diagnostic tools regarding heterogeneity in top-down forcing that influences the vulnerability to and reversibility of shifts to macroalgae on coral reefs.

AB Searching for new effective risk factors on stock returns is an important research topic in asset pricing. Factor modeling is an active research topic in statistics and econometrics, with many new advances. However, these new methods have not been fully utilized in asset pricing application. In this paper, we adopt the factor models, especially matrix factor models in various forms, to construct new statistical factors that explain the variation of stock returns. Furthermore, we evaluate the contribution of these statistical factors beyond the existing factors available in the asset pricing literature. To demonstrate the power of the new factors, U.S. monthly stock data are analyzed, and the partial F test and double selection LASSO method are conducted. The results show that the new statistical factors bring additional information and add explanatory power in asset pricing. Our method opens a new direction for portfolio managers to seek additional risk factors to improve the estimation of portfolio returns.

AB Rich training datasets are essential for machine learning models to work well. Safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving, that heavily rely on supervised learning algorithms, require accurate prediction of human behavioral intentions. Training such prediction algorithms requires not only micro-level action labels but also the estimation of human cognitive states and corresponding reasoning explanations at the same granularity level. However, traditional data labeling tools have limited support for these annotation tasks and deficient data structure. This article proposes a novel annotation tool, MindReaD, that facilitates labeling micro-level interactions with free-form reasoning text and grounding text with their visual representations. Focusing on pedestrian-vehicle interactions as a case study, we defined a data structure to label interaction events, collected data from 83 participants using multiple UI designs, and used the data to train ML models for predicting pedestrian crossing intent. The results show that the unique UI design features of Point-and-Explain and multiple prompts can significantly increase the quality of reasoning data annotations. The model trained with data using the proposed data annotation design outperforms the baseline data, with approximately 7% improvement in overall accuracy. User experience study also confirms positive user attitudes towards the developed data annotation system. The data annotation tool will be released to the public.

AB Fostering creativity is vital for tackling 21st-century challenges, and education plays a key role in nurturing this skill. According to the associative theory, creativity involves connecting distant concepts in semantic memory. Here, we explore how semantic memory changes following an educational intervention intended to promote creativity. Specifically, we examine how a scientific education curriculum-Scientific Creativity in Practice (SCIP) program-impacts the semantic memory networks of 10-18-year-old students in a chemistry class (n = 176). Students in an Intervention group who received the SCIP intervention, and a Control group who did not, completed creative thinking tests, as well as verbal fluency tasks to estimate semantic networks in science-specific (chemistry) and domain-general (animal) categories. Results showed that the SCIP intervention enhanced performance on one test of scientific creative thinking but showed no significant difference on another. Using network science methods, we observed increased interconnectedness in both science-specific and domain-general categories, with lower path distances between concepts and reduced modularity. These traits define a 'small-world' network, balancing connections between closely related and remote concepts. Notably, the chemistry semantic network showed substantially more reorganization, consistent with the chemistry contents of the SCIP intervention. The findings suggest that semantic memory reorganization may be a cognitive mechanism underlying successful creativity interventions in science education.

AB This study contributes to the literature examining public acceptance of carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects in the US. The examination of factors that shape public support for CCS projects provides policymakers with insights to address public concerns, balance CCS development with public sentiments, and make informed decisions about optimal locations and timing. Based on a nationally representative survey on 1850 respondents, the study finds that in the US, there is very low familiarity (6.4%) regarding CCS technology and some limited opposition (11.5%) to increased CCS development. Regression results suggest that support for increased CCS projects in the US is influenced by perceptions of technical and social risks (leakage and community danger, respectively) but not cost of living risks, perceptions of environmental and economic benefits, familiarity with the technology, confidence in government regulations, and a desire for the US to lead in CCS. We fail to find the 'Not-in-My-Backyard' effect, and individuals supporting the development of more CCS in their states also support it at a national level. Understanding these factors helps policymakers anticipate challenges in implementing CCS initiatives and allows for the development of strategies to address concerns.

AB In two experiments, we investigate how social information about the speaker affects pragmatic reasoning in numeral interpretation. Results from a picture selection task show that comprehenders interpret numerals more precisely when uttered by Nerdy speakers - described as studious, introverted and uptight - as opposed to Chill ones - described as extroverted, sociable, and laid-back (Exp.1). Data from a Truth-Value Judgment task (Exp.2) confirm this pattern: comprehenders exhibit more tolerance towards accepting imprecise statements uttered by Chill speakers than Nerdy ones. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating the interplay of social and descriptive meaning into our understanding of pragmatic reasoning and outline several directions of inquiry to take this enterprise further.

AB Large Language models are among the most exciting technologies developed in the last few years. While the model's capabilities continue to improve, researchers, practitioners, and the general public are increasingly aware of some of its shortcomings. What will it take to build trustworthy large language models?
   This tutorial will present a range of recent findings, discussions, questions, and partial answers in the space of trustworthiness in large language models. While this tutorial will not attempt a comprehensive overview of this rich area, we aim to provide the participants with some tools and insights and to understand both the conceptual foundations of trustworthiness and a broad range of ongoing research efforts. We will tackle some of the hard questions that you may have about trustworthy large language models and hopefully address some misconceptions that have become pervasive.

AB Improving equity in K-12 Computer Science (CS) education benefits from the collaboration of classroom teachers, school counselors, and school leaders. This paper presents the outcomes of a pilot program that brought together cross-functional teams consisting of CS teachers, school counselors, and administrators. Over the course of a year, these teams attended monthly, equity-focused workshops, leveraging pre-existing materials from affordable, high-quality, researchbased programs. The use of these resources demonstrated benefits of sequencing and synthesizing existing programs. Evidence from surveys and interviews shows that the workshops promoted learning and fostered collaboration between the cross-functional teams that would not have happened otherwise. Participants were motivated by the program, and they generated ideas that turned into actionable projects to promote CS education equity in their schools. While the initiative was well received, areas for improvement were identified, particularly, in school recruitment, workshop structure, and evaluation. This pilot initiative demonstrates that equity-centered programs comprised of cross-functional teams can help achieve systemic improvement of CS education equity.

AB This article develops a new deep learning framework for general nonlinear filtering. Our main contribution is to present a computationally feasible procedure. The proposed algorithms have the capability of dealing with challenging (infinitely dimensional) filtering problems involving diffusions with randomly-varying switching. First, we convert it to a problem in a finite-dimensional setting by approximating the optimal weights of a neural network. Then, we construct a stochastic gradient-type procedure to approximate the neural network weight parameters, and develop another recursion for adaptively approximating the optimal learning rate. The convergence of the combined approximation algorithms is obtained using stochastic averaging and martingale methods under suitable conditions. Robustness analysis of the approximation to the network parameters with the adaptive learning rate is also dealt with. We demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm using highly nonlinear dynamic system examples.

AB Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) production consumes tremendous amounts of fresh water and energy and releases vast quantities of CO2 into the atmosphere. Not only would an alternative to OPC whose production requires no water, releases little CO2, and consumes less energy represent a transformative advance in the pursuit of industrial decarbonization, but the greater availability of safe drinking water would lead to significantly improved public health, particularly among vulnerable populations most at risk from contaminated water supply. For any OPC alternative to be adopted on any meaningful scale, however, its structural capabilities must meet or exceed those of OPC. An inverse vulcanization of brown grease, sunflower oil, and elemental sulfur (5:5:90 weight ratio) was successfully modified to afford the high-sulfur-content material SunBG(90) in quantities > 1 kg, as was necessary for standardized ASTM and ISO testing. Water absorption (ASTM C140) and thermal conductivity (ISO 8302) values for SunBG(90) (<1 wt% and 0.126 W & BULL;m(-1)& BULL;K-1, respectively) were 84% and 94% lower than those for OPC, respectively, suggesting that SunBG(90) would be more resistant against freeze-thaw and thermal stress damage than OPC. Consequently, not only does SunBG(90) represent a more environmentally friendly material than OPC, but its superior thermomechanical properties suggest that it could be a more environmentally robust material on its own merits, particularly for outdoor structural applications involving significant exposure to water and seasonal or day/night temperature swings.

AB Music is a complex system consisting of many dimensions and hierarchically organized information-the or-ganization of which, to date, we do not fully understand. Network science provides a powerful approach to representing such complex systems, from the social networks of people to modelling the underlying network structures of different cognitive mechanisms. In the present research, we explored whether network science methodology can be extended to model the melodic patterns underlying expert improvised music. Using a large corpus of transcribed improvisations, we constructed a network model in which 5-pitch sequences were linked depending on consecutive occurrences, constituting 116,403 nodes (sequences) and 157,429 edges connecting them. We then investigated whether mathematical graph modelling relates to musical characteristics in real -world listening situations via a behavioral experiment paralleling those used to examine language. We found that as melodic distance within the network increased, participants judged melodic sequences as less related. Moreover, the relationship between distance and reaction time (RT) judgements was quadratic: participants slowed in RT up to distance four, then accelerated; a parallel finding to research in language networks. This study offers insights into the hidden network structure of improvised tonal music and suggests that humans are sen-sitive to the property of melodic distance in this network. More generally, our work demonstrates the similarity between music and language as complex systems, and how network science methods can be used to quantify different aspects of its complexity.

AB About 40% of the US construction workforce experiences high-level fatigue, which leads to poor judgment, increased risk of injuries, a decrease in productivity, and a lower quality of work. Therefore, it is essential to monitor fatigue to reduce its adverse effects and prevent long-term health problems. However, since fatigue demonstrates itself in several complex processes, there is no single standard measurement method for fatigue detection. This study aims to develop a system for continuous workers' fatigue monitoring by predicting the aerobic fatigue threshold (AFT) using forearm muscle activity and motion data. The proposed system consists of five modules: Data acquisition, activity recognition, oxygen uptake prediction, maximum aerobic capacity (MAC) estimation, and continuous AFT monitoring. The proposed system was evaluated on the participants performing fourteen scaffold-building activities. The results show that the AFT features have achieved a higher accuracy of 92.31% in assessing the workers' fatigue level compared to heart rate (51.28%) and percentage heart rate reserve (50.43%) features. Moreover, the overall performance of the proposed system on unseen data using average two-min AFT features was 76.74%. The study validates the feasibility of using forearm muscle activity and motion data to workers' fatigue levels continuously.

AB Hypothesis: The gradients in surfactant distribution at a fluid-fluid interface can induce fluid flow known as the Marangoni flow. Fluid interfaces found in biological and environmental systems are seldom clean, where mixtures of various surfactants are present. The presence of multi-component surfactant mixtures introduces the possibility of interactions among constituents, which may impact Marangoni flows and alter flow dynamics. Experiments: We employed flow visualization, surface tension and reaction kinetic measurements, and numerical simulations to quantitatively investigate the Marangoni flows induced by the reacting surfactant mixtures. Different binary surfactant mixtures were utilized for comparative analysis. Findings: The impact of surfactant interactions on Marangoni flows is confirmed through the observation of diverse complex flow patterns that result from the combination of oppositely charged surfactants in varying composition ratios and concentrations. Unique flow patterns originate from the composition-dependent interfacial phenomena upon mixing surfactants. Our findings provide vital insights that could be used to guide the development of effective oil remediation or the spreading of waterborne pathogens in contaminated regions.

AB Faults, such as malfunctioning sensors, equipment, and control systems, significantly affect a building's performance. Automatic fault detection and diagnosis (AFDD) tools have shown great potential in improving building performances, including both energy efficiency and indoor environment quality. Since modern buildings have integrated systems where multiple subsystems and equipment are coupled, many faults in a building are cross-level faults, i.e., faults occurring in one component that trigger operational abnormalities in other subsystems. Compared with non-cross-level faults, it is more challenging to isolate the root cause of a cross-level faults due to the system coupling effects. Bayesian networks (BNs) have been studied for the root cause isolation for building faults. While promising, existing BN-based diagnosis methods highly rely on expert domain knowledge, which is time-consuming and labor expensive, especially for cross-level faults. To address this challenge, we propose an entropy-based causality learning framework, termed Eigen-Entropy Causal Learning (EECL), to learn BN structures. The proposed method is data-driven without the use of expert domain knowledge; it utilizes causal inference to determine the causal mechanisms between faults status and symptoms to construct the BN model. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, three fault test cases are used for evaluation in this study. Experimental results show that the BN constructed by the proposed framework is able to conduct building cross-level faults diagnosis with a comparable isolation accuracy to those by domain knowledge while maintaining less complexed BN structure.

AB This paper presents a method for evaluating the irradiance of a single freeform surface deviation under extended source illumination. The method takes advantage of a well-known concept, the pinhole image. First, the irradiance of the perturbed freeform surface under point source illumination is computed. Second, a pinhole image of the extended source is obtained by placing a small aperture (pinhole) on the freeform surface. Then, the extended source irradiance pattern change can be quickly calculated by convolving the pinhole image with the perturbed point source irradiance change. The method was experimentally verified, demonstrating the efficacy of the underlying concept. The proposed method alleviates the computational demands during extended source tolerancing, expediting the process.

ID RACE DIFFERENCES; INTELLIGENCE; ANCESTRY; GEOGRAPHY; IQ
AB Although the American Psychological Association has taken a strong antiracism stance, scientific racism continues to be published in psychology journals and scholarly books. Recent articles claim that the folk categories of race are genetically meaningful divisions and that evolved genetic differences among races and nations are important for explaining immutable differences in cognitive ability, educational attainment, crime, sexual behavior, and wealth; all claims that are opposed by a strong scientific consensus to the contrary. These claims remain a serious source of harm through the naturalization of inequality and through support for the work of racial extremists. Contemporary "racial hereditarian research" claims to rest on modern genetics and evolutionary biology and to draw on their methods, such as genome-wide association studies. These new arguments fail to meet the evidentiary and ethical standards of these disciplines for the study of human variation. If psychology adopted standards from genetics and evolutionary biology, the current racial hereditarian work would be ineligible for publication. Actions that the American Psychological Association can take to deal with scientific racism are described.

AB Introduction Although the demand for graduates with Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) credentials continues to climb, women remain underrepresented as both students and faculty in STEM higher education. Compounding social forces can hinder organizational change for gender equity in STEM, constraining institutions and individuals within them. This study advances macrostructural theory to examine the impact of gender composition (including group size and heterogeneity) of women faculty on structural change, as measured by gender desegregation of STEM degree earners. We advance this theory by incorporating faculty rank, rather than treating group composition as a static category.Method This study draws on a federal repository of data to assess institutional change in the share of STEM women faculty in the U.S. We employ quasi-experimental methods to explore the following research questions: (1) does hiring more women onto an institution's faculty roster shrink the gender gap among STEM degree earners? and (2) does segregation of faculty by gender within institutions shape the gender gap among STEM degree earners?Findings While institutional efforts herald their efforts of hiring more women faculty, our findings indicate that gender desegregation of STEM degree earners partially depends on the promotion of women faculty to tenure.Discussion Implications for theory, policy, and practice are discussed, with a focus on institutional-level change.

AB The NSF ACCESS program has implemented a vendor-supplied AI chatbot using the OpenAI GPT-4 large language model. ACCESS provides high performance computing (HPC) resources to researchers by allocating time at computing centers at diverse institutions of higher education across the United States. Effectively implementing a large language model on a limited knowledge base for the diversity of the resources and technical nature of HPC in general has raised questions in optimal knowledge base construction. The following analysis takes a limited test case to investigate the driving factors contributing to the accuracy of the chatbot's response to predetermined prompts, specifically regarding the clusters on which specific software applications are currently available. It additionally tests the necessity of providing documentation of synonymous terms in the form of a synonym dictionary in the knowledge base. While ongoing, this initial research utilizing logistic regression suggests the knowledge base is yet insufficient for the prompts given and that the synonym dictionary has no statistically significant effect on the response.

AB There is a clear and present desire from government authorities to actualize processes and procedures that place equity at the forefront of decision-making and improve supply chain resilience. Following a federal executive order, several agencies including the Federal Emergency Management Agency have instituted initiatives focused on equity in resilience planning, recognizing the variance in how different populations are impacted during disturbances. To actualize policy and programmatic priorities, decision makers need tools that are theoretically grounded yet computationally simplistic and adoptable for participants outside of academia. Thus, developing methodology that is deployable at scale within the framework of average agency capabilities remains critical. This research seeks to leverage network science, transportation theory, and social vulnerability analysis to explore the relationship between the exposure of counties to food supply disruptions through the road and highway transportation network and their community social vulnerability. This result highlights that in our food transportation network, targeted attacks are not more impactful than random removals when fewer nodes are removed. Our results also found that the most exposed counties are generally in the southeastern portion of the region. In our study area, a large part of the exposure is due to the high food-inflow demand. The framework presented is both theoretically grounded and computationally simplistic and presents a potential strategy for understanding social vulnerability alongside critical infrastructure resilience.

AB Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are the future of personal and public transportation, but many security issues exist related to the communication and activity of such transportation means. Beyond the obvious, these security issues raise important safety concerns for a CAV's human occupants. Our focus is on the ubiquitous use of controller area network (CAN) bus technology for internal vehicle networks (IVNs) and how we can secure them with the rigid implementation of zero trust. Through an analysis of current threat vectors, we propose a zero-trust architecture to fundamentally protect the individual components that make up a CAV's sensor and control network through the use of the CAN bus. We use a simulated environment to show how our architectural approach provides net benefits and offer thoughts on the application of the architecture to IVN use cases but also how it might be expanded to inter-CAV communication in the future.

ID SYSTEMS DRIVEN; CHAINS
AB In this paper, we obtain a moderate deviations principle (MDP) for a class of Langevin dynamic systems with a strong damping and fast Markovian switching. To facilitate our study, first, analysis of systems with bounded drifts is dealt with. To obtain the desired moderate deviations, the exponential tightness of the solution of the Langevin equation is proved. Then, the solution of its first-order approximation using local MDPs is examined. Finally, the MDPs are established. To enable the treatment of unbounded drifts, a reduction technique is presented near the end of the paper, which shows that Lipschitz continuous drifts can be dealt with.

AB The number and location of subconductors in an overhead transmission line affect its inductance and capacitance, leading to a change in its natural power. Traditionally, for conventional transmission lines around above 300 kV, more than one conductor has been used as bundles for each phase. The subconductors in these bundles have been placed in a symmetrical arrangement in space. Conventional high-natural power lines are designed to have a greater number of subconductors per bundle and a greater bundle radius than a conventional line at the same voltage level. In this paper, new configurations with various numbers of subconductors for unconventional high natural power line designs are studied. The term "unconventional" denotes that the subconductors are not arranged in space in the traditional symmetrical configurations used in the conventional lines and conventional high natural power lines mentioned above. Instead, their optimized locations are found so that their natural power can be further increased. The aim is to enhance the natural power of these new line designs via optimally located subconductor configurations to achieve narrower corridor width as well. Moreover, for these optimally designed transmission lines, 1) corona loss, 2) audible noise, 3) radio and television interferences, 4) location of shield wires, and 5) electric and magnetic fields under these lines are calculated and compared with them for conventional lines. It has been shown that for our newly designed unconventional line with $N=8$ , the SIL achieved is 1414.70 MW, which is a 43% increase compared to that of the conventional line; and the reduced line width of 9.7 m is only 40% of that of the conventional line. Consequently, this leads to the mentioned unconventional line having a natural power density of 3.38 times that of the conventional line.

ID EQUITY
AB In this conceptual paper, we explore how science teachers might enact social justice through their everyday science instruction. Drawing on empirical literature and our own K-12 teaching experience, we develop a heuristic for mapping classroom discourses to engage in action and reflection to change both the world of the classroom community, and the world beyond the school. We suggest how this heuristic can be used for justice-oriented science teaching independently of (or as a supplement to) any existing frameworks for science teaching to promote social justice. Our proposed model for social justice through disciplinary science teaching frames justice not as an abstract goal, but as the act of iterating 'quotidian justices' achievable in moment-to-moment pedagogical choices. We contend that this approach allows teachers to resist systemic injustices while also navigating institutional constraints.

AB Batteries based on the redox of multivalent cations (Mg2+, Ca2+, Zn2+, Al3+, etc.) offer potential advantages over today's lithium-ion batteries, but their development is hindered by the sluggish migration of such ions in solid electrodes and electrolytes. Computational screening can accelerate the discovery of more conductive materials, provided that ionic conductivity can be estimated with sufficient accuracy and efficiency. The present study examines whether vibrational properties can be used to predict energetic barriers for cation migration in 24 prototypical multivalent solid electrolytes. Phonon band centers (i.e., mean frequencies), which have been previously used to predict Li-ion conductivity, are calculated using density functional theory. Band centers alone are found not to correlate with migration barriers (R-2 = 0.02), perhaps due to poor alignment of low-frequency phonon eigenmodes with ion migration pathways in some materials. A new metric that incorporates both frequencies and alignments-the mean alignment-weighted frequency-is more strongly correlated to migration barriers (R-2 = 0.25). Materials in this study with the lowest migration barriers consistently exhibit the lowest mean alignment-weighted frequencies, suggesting the utility of this metric for filtering out materials with high barriers in screening efforts. Comparisons to previous studies suggest that phonon band centers may be correlated to migration barriers only in compositionally similar materials and that adding alignment information may enable more reliable predictions among more diverse sets of materials. These results quantify the promise of using phonon frequencies and alignments, perhaps in combination with other properties, to efficiently screen for materials with high multivalent ionic conductivity.

AB Given N points X = {x(k)}(N)(k=1 )on the unit circle in R-2 and a number 0 <= p <= infinity, we investigate the minimizers of the functional Sigma(N)(k, l = 1) ,|(x(k) ,x(l))|(p). While it is known that each of these minimizers is a spanning set for R-2, less is known about their number as a function of p and N especially for relatively small p . In this paper we show that there is unique minimum for this functional for all p <= log 3/ log 2 and all odd N >= 3. In addition, we present some numerical results suggesting the emergence of a phase transition phenomenon for these minimizers. More specifically, for N >= 3 odd, there exists a sequence of points log 3/ log 2 = p(1) < p(2) < ... < p(N) <= 2 so that a unique (up to some isometries) minimizer exists on each of the subintervals (p(k), p(k+1)).

AB In recent years, electric vehicles (EVs) have emerged as a sustainable alternative to conventional automobiles. Distinguished by their environmental friendliness, superior performance, reduced noise, and low maintenance requirements, EVs offer numerous advantages over traditional vehicles. The integration of electric vehicles with cloud computing has heralded a transformative shift in the automotive industry. However, as EVs become increasingly interconnected with the internet, various devices, and infrastructure, they become susceptible to cyberattacks. These attacks pose a significant risk to the safety, privacy, and functionality of both the vehicles and the broader transportation infrastructure.
   In this paper, we delve into the topic of electric vehicles and their connectivity to the cloud. We scrutinize the potential attack vectors that EVs are vulnerable to and the consequential impact on vehicle operations. Moreover, we outline both general and specific strategies aimed at thwarting these cyberattacks. Additionally, we anticipate future developments aimed at enhancing EV performance and reducing security risks.

ID DRIVEN
AB Achieving multicapability in a single soft gripper for handling ultrasoft, ultrathin, and ultraheavy objects is challenging due to the tradeoff between compliance, strength, and precision. Here, combining experiments, theory, and simulation, we report utilizing angle-programmed tendril-like grasping trajectories for an ultragentle yet ultrastrong and ultraprecise gripper. The single gripper can delicately grasp fragile liquids with minimal contact pressure (0.05 kPa), lift objects 16,000 times its own weight, and precisely grasp ultrathin, flexible objects like 4-& mu;m-thick sheets and 2-& mu;m-diameter microfibers on flat surfaces, all with a high success rate. Its scalable and material-independent design allows for biodegradable noninvasive grippers made from natural leaves. Explicitly controlled trajectories facilitate its integration with robotic arms and prostheses for challenging tasks, including picking grapes, opening zippers, folding clothes, and turning pages. This work showcases soft grippers excelling in extreme scenarios with potential applications in agriculture, food processing, prosthesis, biomedicine, minimally invasive surgeries, and deep-sea exploration.
   Soft grippers can emulate human hands, but it remains challenging to achieve multiple capability in manipulating various objects in one design. Hong et al. utilize a kirigami gripper with controllable and programmable trajectories to manipulate objects spanning from ultra-soft to ultra-strong with high precision.

AB A practical and well-studied method for computing the novelty of a design is to construct an ordinal embedding via a collection of pairwise comparisons between items (called triplets), and use distances within that embedding to compute which designs are farthest from the center. Unfortunately, ordinal embedding methods can require a large number of triplets before their primary error measure-the triplet violation error-converges. But if our goal is accurate novelty estimation, is it really necessary to fully minimize all triplet violations? Can we extract useful information regarding the novelty of all or some items using fewer triplets than classical convergence rates might imply? This paper addresses this question by studying the relationship between triplet violation error and novelty score error when using ordinal embeddings. Specifically, we compare how errors in embeddings produced by Generalized Non-Metric Dimensional Scaling (GNMDS) converge under different sampling methods, for different numbers of embedded items, sizes of latent spaces, and for the top K most novel designs.
   We find that estimating the novelty of a set of items via ordinal embedding can require significantly fewer human-provided triplets than is needed to converge the triplet error, and that this effect is modulated by the type of triplet sampling method (random versus uncertainty sampling). We also find that uncertainty sampling causes unique converge behavior in estimating most novel items compared to non-novel items. Our results imply that in certain situations one can use ordinal embedding techniques to estimate novelty error in fewer samples than is typically expected. Moreover, the convergence behavior of top K novel items motivates new potential triplet sampling methods that go beyond typical triplet reduction measures.

AB Cybersickness is a common ailment associated with virtual reality (VR) user experiences. Several automated methods exist based on machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) to detect cybersickness. However, most of these cybersickness detection methods are perceived as computationally intensive and black-box methods. Thus, those techniques are neither trustworthy nor practical for deploying on standalone energy-constrained VR head-mounted devices (HMDs). In this work, we present an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)-based framework LiteVR for cybersickness detection, explaining the model's outcome, reducing the feature dimensions, and overall computational costs. First, we develop three cybersickness DL models based on long-term short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and multilayer perceptron (MLP). Then, we employed a post-hoc explanation, such as SHapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), to explain the results and extract the most dominant features of cybersickness. Finally, we retrain the DL models with the reduced number of features. Our results show that eye-tracking features are the most dominant for cybersickness detection. Furthermore, based on the XAI-based feature ranking and dimensionality reduction, we significantly reduce the model's size by up to 4.3x, training time by up to 5.6x, and its inference time by up to 3.8x, with higher cybersickness detection accuracy and low regression error (i.e., on Fast Motion Scale (FMS)). Our proposed lite LSTM model obtained an accuracy of 94% in classifying cybersickness and regressing (i.e., FMS 1-10) with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.30, which outperforms the state-of-the-art. Our proposed LiteVR framework can help researchers and practitioners analyze, detect, and deploy their DL-based cybersickness detection models in standalone VR HMDs.

AB Thanks to advances in the urban big data, the bike sharing, especially station-based bike sharing, has emerged as the important first-/last-mile connectivities in many smart cities. Bike station network (BSN) expansion recommendation, i.e., recommending placement locations of new stations, is essential for satisfying local mobility demands, enhancing the BSN service quality, and may significantly affect the resource fairness and accessibility of different communities in the neighborhood. Furthermore, the dynamic and complex urban mobility environments make the station placement highly challenging to satisfy the mobility needs.
   To ease and facilitate the urban planning with awareness of mobility equity, we have designed and proposed CGIRL, a novel equity-aware Cross-Graph Interactive Reinforcement Learning approach for BSN expansion recommendation. Specifically, we have designed a novel reward function within our actor-critic reinforcement learning approach, jointly accounting for the local mobility, bike resource distribution equity, and accessibility of different socioeconomic groups to the expanded stations. To capture the policy of station decisions from the BSN deployment, we integrate the location graph's mobility and equity correlations across the city regions as a graph network, and design a novel cross-graph interaction network with embedding attention and sequential dependency that adaptively captures and interactively differentiates the correlations within station placement. Our extensive experimental studies upon a total of 393 (111 new) bike stations from New York City (NYC), Washington D.C. (DC), and Chicago have validated the effectiveness of CGIRL in the equity-aware BSN expansion recommendation.

AB A series of phosphine-mediated reactions resulting in the cleavage of sulfur-sulfur bonds in the imidazole-based dithione dimer (1) have been investigated. 2, the first X-ray structurally characterized 1,2,5-trithiepin, was synthesized through triphenylphosphine-mediated thermal extrusion of sulfur from 1. While reaction of 1 with P(NMe2)(3) gave a zwitterionic phosphine-dithiolene complex (3), through heterolytic cleavage of the sulfur-sulfur bonds in 1, the thiophosphonate 4 was obtained when P(OMe)(3) was combined with 1. Reaction of 2 with NHCiPr produced 5, containing a unique S+-C=C-S-C=C-S- zwitterionic core.

AB Iron partitioning among the main lower mantle phases, bridgmanite (Bm) and ferropericlase (Fp), has non-monotonic behavior owing to the high-spin to low-spin crossover in ferrous iron (Fe2+) in Fp. Previously reported iron partitioning coefficient between these phases, KD ${K}_{D}$, still have considerable uncertainty. Here, we investigate the Fe2+ partitioning behavior using ab initio free energy results. Although we focus on Fe2+ only, we describe the effect of this iron spin crossover (ISC) on KD ${K}_{D}$ and of the latter on compositions and seismic velocities in a pyrolitic aggregate. Our results suggest that its velocities are mainly affected by the ISC and less so by the Fe2+ partitioning. In contrast, iron partitioning manifests in thermally induced velocity heterogeneity ratios. Prediction of the seismological parameter RS/P ${R}_{S/P}$ partial derivative lnVS/partial derivative lnVP $\left(\partial \,\mathrm{ln}{V}_{S}/\partial \,\mathrm{ln}{V}_{P}\right)$ including iron partitioning effects resembles quantitatively RS/P ${R}_{S/P}$'s inferred from several tomographic studies down to 2,400 km depth.

AB Fe3+delta GeTe2 (FGT) has proved to be an interesting van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnetic compound with a tunable Curie temperature (TC). However, the underlying mechanism for varying TC remains elusive. Here, we systematically investigate and compare low-temperature magnetic properties of single crystalline FGT samples that exhibit T(C)s ranging from 160 K to 205 K. Spin stiffness (D) and spin excitation gap (Delta) are extracted using Bloch's theory for crystals with varying Fe content. Compared to Cr-based vdW ferromagnets, FGT compounds have higher spin stiffness values but lower spin wave excitation gaps. We discuss the implication of these relationships in Fe-Fe ion magnetic interactions in FGT unit cells. The itinerancy of magnetic electrons is measured and discussed under the Rhodes-Wohlfarth ratio (RWR) and the Takahashi theory.

AB Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are attractive materials for combating the antimicrobial resistance crisis because they can kill target microbes by directly disrupting cell membranes. Although thousands of AMPs have been discovered, their molecular mechanisms of action are still poorly understood. One broad mechanism for membrane disruption is the formation of membrane-spanning hydrophilic pores which can be stabilized by AMPs. In this study, we use molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the thermodynamics of pore formation in model single-component lipid membranes in the presence of one of three AMPs: aurein 1.2, melittin and magainin 2. To overcome the general challenge of modeling long time scale membrane-related behaviors, including AMP binding, clustering, and pore formation, we develop a generalizable methodology for sampling AMP-induced pore formation. This approach involves the long equilibration of peptides around a pore created with a nucleation collective variable by performing coarse-grained simulations, then backmapping equilibrated AMP-membrane configurations to all-atom resolution. We then perform all-atom simulations to resolve free energy profiles for pore formation while accurately modeling the interplay of lipid-peptide-solvent interactions that dictate pore formation free energies. Using this approach, we quantify free energy barriers for pore formation without direct biases on peptides or whole lipids, allowing us to investigate mechanisms of pore formation for these 3 AMPs that are a consequence of unbiased peptide diffusion and clustering. Further analysis of simulation trajectories then relates variations in pore lining by AMPs, AMP-induced lipid disruptions, and salt bridges between AMPs to the observed pore formation free energies and corresponding mechanisms. This methodology and mechanistic analysis have the potential to generalize beyond the AMPs in this study to improve our understanding of pore formation by AMPs and related antimicrobial materials.

AB If contextual values can play necessary and beneficial roles in scientific research, to what extent should science communicators be transparent about such values? This question is particularly pressing in contexts where there appears to be significant resistance among some non-experts to accept certain scientific claims or adopt science-based policies or recommendations. This paper examines whether value transparency can help promote non-experts' warranted epistemic trust of experts. I argue that there is a prima facie case in favor of transparency because it can promote four conditions that are thought to be required for epistemic trustworthiness. I then consider three main arguments that transparency about values is likely to be ineffective in promoting such trust (and may undermine it). This analysis shows that while these arguments show that value transparency is not sufficient for promoting epistemic trust, they fail to show that rejecting value transparency as a norm for science communicators is more likely to promote warranted epistemic trust than a qualified norm of value transparency (along with other strategies). Finally, I endorse a tempered understanding of value transparency and consider what this might require in practice.

AB Concrete additive manufacturing (AM) is an emerging technology that enables the fabrication of complex and efficient geometries with intricate features. Here, the mechanical performance of bio-inspired sinusoidally architected concrete is investigated in comparison to monolithic, cast counterparts. A robotic additive manufacturing process was utilized to fabricate sinusoidal architectures in three orientations (denoted X, Y, and Z) and two rectilinear architectures and compared to conventionally cast specimens of equivalent geometries. Single-edge bend and single-edge-notched bend experiments were performed to test the strength and fracture toughness, respectively. Unlike rectilinear architectures, the X and Z-Sinusoidal architected concrete elicited a flexural strength and fracture toughness statistically equivalent to cast counterparts, whereas the Y-Sinusoidal architecture exhibited a 71 % increase in flexural strength as compared to the cast counterparts. Finite element simulations were carried out to evaluate the effect of sinusoidal frequency and amplitude on stress distribution through the test specimens. In addition, a theoretical analysis of stress concentration was conducted to understand the role of sinusoidal perturbation from surface to core. The sinusoidal architectures were observed to produce stress concentrations and non-uniform stress profiles (depending on two design variables, i.e., amplitude, A, and wavelength, lambda), which led to outperforming rectilinear additively manufactured and cast counterparts.

DE recommender systems; sequential recommendation
AB State-of-the-art sequential recommendation relies heavily on self-attention-based recommender models. Yet such models are computationally expensive and often too slow for real-time recommendation. Furthermore, the self-attention operation is performed at a sequence-level, thereby making low-cost incremental inference challenging. Inspired by recent advances in efficient language modeling, we propose linear recurrent units for sequential recommendation (LRURec). Similar to recurrent neural networks, LRURec offers rapid inference and can achieve incremental inference on sequential inputs. By decomposing the linear recurrence operation and designing recursive parallelization in our framework, LRURec provides the additional benefits of reduced model size and parallelizable training. Moreover, we optimize the architecture of LRURec by implementing a series of modifications to address the lack of non-linearity and improve training dynamics. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed LRURec, we conduct extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets and compare its performance against state-of-the-art sequential recommenders. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LRURec, which consistently outperforms baselines by a significant margin. Results also highlight the efficiency of LRURec with our parallelized training paradigm and fast inference on long sequences, showing its potential to further enhance user experience in sequential recommendation.

AB Conformal patterning using contact printing methods has been problematic, owing to the complex topography of realistic surfaces and the sensitivity of print quality to the nozzle-substrate distance. Motion planning for such printing configurations is also a challenge, with conventional methods using tessellated representations to generate conformal toolpaths. However, these representations are often subject to truncation errors, thus diminishing the accuracy of the printed part. We propose and demonstrate a novel method to perform conformal aerosol jet printing on curved and topographically complex surfaces. We begin with a non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) definition of a surface, perform patch selection (i.e., area of interest) and extract its associated points and normals, and then generate GCode for conformal printing. We make use of a serpentine toolpath that resembles a strain-sensor pattern, thus suggesting the generalization of this method to conformal printing of circuits for applications in sensing, chemical analysis, thermal management, and pharmaceutical delivery with relative ease.

AB Chemical sensing has a vital role in promoting security and welfare. Functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) possess unique electronic, mechanical and chemical properties, rendering them as exceptional transducers for developing highly sensitive, selective and robust chemical sensors. In this Primer, we discuss the progress and challenges associated with chemiresistive sensing using functionalized CNTs, providing an introductory overview, spanning from theoretical to experimental aspects. Various covalent and non-covalent CNT functionalization strategies that contribute to enhancing the sensitivity and selectivity of chemiresistive sensors are discussed, along with their respective merits and drawbacks. Additionally, this Primer focuses on the critical facets of experimental design, including material selection, device architecture and fabrication and best practices for sensor testing. This Primer also discusses the significance of rigorous data interpretation, analysis and reporting, ensuring reproducibility and reliability. Finally, this Primer highlights the existing limitations of CNT-based chemiresistive sensors and investigates potential strategies for enhancing sensor selectivity and sensitivity that may broaden their applicability in diverse fields, from environmental monitoring to biomedical diagnostics. By emphasizing the need to understand the molecular interactions between the sensor and target analyte to improve selectivity, this Primer aims to offer a comprehensive understanding of the current state of CNT-based chemiresistive sensing.

AB We present the post-synthetic modification of a polyoxovanadate-alkoxide (POV-alkoxide) cluster via the reactivity of its cationic form, [V6O7(OCH3)(12)](1+), with water. This result indicates that cluster oxidation increases the lability of bridging methoxide ligands, affording a ligand exchange reaction that serves to compensate for the increased charge of the cluster core. This synthetic advance affords the isolation of a series of POV-alkoxide clusters with varying degrees of mu(2)-O2- ligands incorporated at the surface, namely, [V6O8(OCH3)(11)], [V6O9(OCH3)(10)], and [V6O10(OCH3)(9)]. Characterization of the POV-alkoxide clusters is described; changes in the infrared and electronic absorption spectra are consistent with the oxidation of the cluster core. We also examine the consequences of ligand substitution on the redox properties of the series of POValkoxide clusters via cyclic voltammetry; decreased alkoxide ligand density translates to a cathodic shift of analogous redox events. Ligand substitution also increases comproportionation constants of the Lindqvist core, indicating electron exchange between vanadium centers is promoted in structures with greater numbers of mu(2)-O2- ligands.

DE Autoregressive model; Inference frameworks; Parallel Pipelining;
   Distributed inference
AB Autoregressive models, despite their commendable performance in a myriad of generative tasks, face challenges stemming from their inherently sequential structure. Inference on these models, by design, harnesses a temporal dependency, where the current token's probability distribution is conditioned on preceding tokens. This inherent characteristic severely impedes computational efficiency during inference as a typical inference request can require more than thousands of tokens, where generating each token requires a load of entire model weights, making the inference more memory-bound. The large overhead becomes profound in real deployment where requests arrive randomly, necessitating various generation lengths. Existing solutions, such as dynamic batching and concurrent instances, introduce significant response delays and bandwidth contention, falling short of achieving optimal latency and throughput. To address these shortcomings, we propose Flover - a temporal fusion framework for efficiently inferring multiple requests in parallel. We deconstruct the general generation pipeline into pre-processing and token generation, and equip the framework with a dedicated work scheduler for fusing the generation process temporally across all requests. By orchestrating the token-level parallelism, Flover exhibits optimal hardware efficiency and significantly spares the system resources. By further employing a fast buffer reordering algorithm that allows memory eviction of finished tasks, it brings over 11x inference speedup on GPT and 16x on LLAMA compared to the cutting-edge solutions provided by NVIDIA FasterTransformer. Crucially, by leveraging the advanced tensor parallel technique, Flover proves efficacious across diverse computational landscapes, from single-GPU setups to distributed scenarios, thereby offering robust performance optimization that adapts to variable use cases.

DE misinformation detection; domain adaptation
ID FAKE NEWS
AB Despite recent progress in improving the performance of misinformation detection systems, classifying misinformation in an unseen domain remains an elusive challenge. To address this issue, a common approach is to introduce a domain critic and encourage domain-invariant input features. However, early misinformation often demonstrates both conditional and label shifts against existing misinformation data (e.g., class imbalance in COVID-19 datasets), rendering such methods less effective for detecting early misinformation. In this paper, we propose contrastive adaptation network for early misinformation detection (CANMD). Specifically, we leverage pseudo labeling to generate high-confidence target examples for joint training with source data. We additionally design a label correction component to estimate and correct the label shifts (i.e., class priors) between the source and target domains. Moreover, a contrastive adaptation loss is integrated in the objective function to reduce the intra-class discrepancy and enlarge the inter-class discrepancy. As such, the adapted model learns corrected class priors and an invariant conditional distribution across both domains for improved estimation of the target data distribution. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CANMD, we study the case of COVID-19 early misinformation detection and perform extensive experiments using multiple real-world datasets. The results suggest that CANMD can effectively adapt misinformation detection systems to the unseen COVID-19 target domain with significant improvements compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.

TI Optical image quality testing and correction of a 250-mm freeform

SO OPTICS CONTINUUM
LA English
DT Article
AB Designing with freeform optics makes it possible to correct imaging systems to high-performance levels in a compact format. To justify the extra challenges inherent in the design, fabrication, metrology, and assembly of systems utilizing freeform optics, engineers need a realistic understanding of the performance that can be expected. The real-world performance of these systems has remained under-explored in the literature, a factor that may dissuade the adoption of freeform optics. In this work, the MTF of an F/3, 3 degrees diagonal full FOV, 250-mm aperture freeform telescope is characterized at multiple field angles using an off-axis parabolic collimator. The freeform optic components required minimal alignment steps and no postpolishing. Twenty-seven sub-aperture tilted knife-edge tests were conducted to evaluate the correlation between form error and image quality. The telescope's image quality was determined to be consistent with the design specification, which was 30% MTF at 76 lp/mm (70% of the sensor-array Nyquist frequency) across the entire field.

AB Science communication has historically been inequitable, with certain voices and perspectives holding the power and dominant ways of knowing being promoted over others. Recently, there has been a push toward inclusive science communication, which values diverse perspectives and ways of knowing in collaborative conversations to solve complex socioscientific issues. However, there is a lack of both trainings in inclusive science communication for undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students as well as established ways to evaluate the efficacy of these trainings. To address this need, we designed a new multifactorial survey based on the Theory of Planned Behavior to assess students' attitudes/norms, self-efficacy, behavioral intents, and behaviors in inclusive science communication, which we termed the Planned Behaviors in Inclusive Science Communication (PB-ISC) Scale. We utilized expert review, exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, cognitive interviews, and quantitative measures to gather evidence of validity supporting the proposed use of the final 4-factor, 26-item survey. This survey can be used as a tool by science communication educators and researchers to assess students' planned behavior in inclusive science communication in response to trainings or experiences in science communication or related topics like socioscientific issues, civic engagement, and citizen science.

AB This perspective article focuses on the exploration and advocacy of approaches to be considered in designing equitable learning experiences for students' use of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and technology through the Universal Design for Learning Framework (UDL) exemplifying chemistry examples that can be applied to any course in STEM. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are causing disruptions within learning in higher education and is also casting a spotlight on systemic inequities particularly affecting minoritized groups broadly and in STEM fields. Particularly, the emergence of AI has focused on inequities toward minoritized students in academic and professional ethics. As the U.S. education system grapples with a nuanced mix of acceptance and hesitation towards AI, the necessity for inclusive and equitable education, impactful learning practices, and innovative strategies has become more pronounced. Promoting equitable approaches for the use of artificial intelligence and technology in STEM learning will be an important milestone in addressing STEM disparities toward minoritized groups and equitable accessibility to evolving technology.

AB Magnesium silicate hydrate (M-S-H) represents a promising alternative to traditional cement, particularly for low-pH construction applications such as nuclear waste encapsulation and carbon dioxide injection. The durability of construction materials, a critical aspect of their suitability for various purposes, is primarily governed by the kinetics of dissolution of the binder phase under service conditions. In this study, we employed in situ atomic force microscopy to assess the dissolution rates of M-S-H in water equilibrated with air. Quantitative analysis based on changes in volume and height revealed dissolution rates ranging from 0.18 to 3.09 x 10(-12) mol/cm(2)/s depending on the precipitate Mg/Si ratio and morphology. This rate surpasses its crystalline analogs, talc (Mg3Si4O10(OH)(2)) and serpentine (Mg-3(Si2O5)(OH)(4)), by about three to five orders of magnitude. Interestingly, oriented M-S-H dissolved faster than non-oriented M-S-H. Spatially resolved assessments of dissolution rates facilitated a direct correlation between rates and morphology, showing that edges and smaller crystallites dissolve at a faster pace compared to facets and larger crystallites. The outcomes of this study provide insights into the mechanisms governing the dissolution of M-S-H and the factors dictating its durability. These findings hold implications for the strategic design and optimization of M-S-H for various applications.

AB We present machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) for simulations of Si-C-O-H compounds. The MLIPs are constructed from moment tensor potentials (MTPs) and were trained to a library of configurations that included polysiloxane structures, hypothetical crystalline and amorphous SiCOH structures, and trajectories of Si-C-O-H systems obtained via ab initio molecular dynamic (aiMD) simulations at elevated temperatures. Passive, active, and hybrid learning strategies were implemented to develop the MLIPs. The MLIPs reproduce vibrational properties of polymers and SiCOH structures obtained from aiMD simulations, thus providing a tool to identify chemical units and distinct structural characteristics through their vibrational properties. Simulations of the polymer-to-ceramic transformation show the development of mixed tetrahedra in SiCO ceramics and align with experimental observations. Million-atom simulations for several nanoseconds highlight the precipitation of graphitic nanosheets from a carbon-rich SiCO precursor. Atomistic simulations with the MLIPs deliver details of chemical reaction mechanisms during the pyrolysis of polysiloxanes, including methane abstraction and Kumada-like rearrangements that transform the siloxane backbone. While the MLIPs still leave room for systematic improvement, they deliver simulations with "density functional theory (DFT)-like" quality at low and high temperatures.

AB Resource allocation has always been a critical challenge for construction project planning, and it affects the cost, duration, and quality of the projects. However, current methods mainly focus on a single project and lack integrated planning and optimization across a construction company's multiple projects. This paper describes a simulation of an Autonomous Resource Allocation (ARA) model using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents and methods like Double Deep Q-Networks and combined experience replay to develop and test ARA algorithms based on data harvesting from the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The results show that DRL can successfully perform ARA by capturing the complex interactions among resource allocation features, without needing retraining when situations change. It shows promising future possibilities for construction companies to improve resource utilization and project performance for larger and more complex construction projects.

AB In the healthcare domain, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) assumes a pivotal role, as it employs Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) methodologies to extract invaluable insights from imaging data. Nonetheless, the imperative need for patient privacy poses significant challenges when collecting data from diverse healthcare sources. Consequently, the Deep Learning (DL) communities occasionally face difficulties detecting rare features. In this research endeavor, we introduce the Ensemble-Based Federated Learning (EBFL) Framework, an innovative solution tailored to address this challenge. The EBFL framework deviates from the conventional approach by emphasizing model features over sharing sensitive patient data. This unique methodology fosters a collaborative and privacy-conscious environment for healthcare institutions, empowering them to harness the capabilities of a centralized server for model refinement while upholding the utmost data privacy standards. Conversely, a robust ensemble architecture boasts potent feature extraction capabilities, distinguishing itself from a single DL model. This quality makes it remarkably dependable for MRI analysis. By harnessing our ground-breaking EBFL methodology, we have achieved remarkable precision in the classification of brain tumors, including glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and non-tumor instances, attaining a precision rate of 94% for the Global model and an impressive 96% for the Ensemble model. Our models underwent rigorous evaluation using conventional performance metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and Fl Score. Integrating DL within the Federated Learning (FL) framework has yielded a methodology that offers precise and dependable diagnostics for detecting brain tumors.

AB AI-powered coding assistant tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot, and IntelliCode) have revolutionized the software engineering ecosystem. However, prior work has demonstrated that these tools are vulnerable to poisoning attacks. In a poisoning attack, an attacker intentionally injects maliciously crafted insecure code snippets into training datasets to manipulate these tools. The poisoned tools can suggest insecure code to developers, resulting in vulnerabilities in their products that attackers can exploit. However, it is still little understood whether such poisoning attacks against the tools would be practical in real-world settings and how developers address the poisoning attacks during software development. To understand the real-world impact of poisoning attacks on developers who rely on AI-powered coding assistants, we conducted two user studies: an online survey and an in-lab study. The online survey involved 238 participants, including software developers and computer science students. The survey results revealed widespread adoption of these tools among participants, primarily to enhance coding speed, eliminate repetition, and gain boilerplate code. However, the survey also found that developers may misplace trust in these tools because they overlooked the risk of poisoning attacks. The in-lab study was conducted with 30 professional developers. The developers were asked to complete three programming tasks with a representative type of AI-powered coding assistant tool (e.g., ChatGPT or IntelliCode), running on Visual Studio Code. The in-lab study results showed that developers using a poisoned ChatGPT-like tool were more prone to including insecure code than those using an IntelliCode-like tool or no tool. This demonstrates the strong influence of these tools on the security of generated code. Our study results highlight the need for education and improved coding practices to address new security issues introduced by AI-powered coding assistant tools.

AB Low cost and high durability have made Portland cement the most widely-used building material, but benefits are offset by environmental harm of cement pro-duction contributing 8-10% of total anthropogenic CO2 gas emissions. High sul-fur-content materials (HSMs) are an alternative that can perform the binding roles as cements with a smaller carbon footprint, and possibly superior chemical, physical, and mechanical properties. Inverse vulcanization of 90 wt% sulfur with 10 wt% canola oil or sunflower oil to yield CanS or SunS, respectively. Notably, these HSMs prepared at temperatures <= 180 degrees C compared to > 1200 degrees C hours for Portland cement CanS was combined with 5 wt% fly ash (FA), silica fume (SF), ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS), or metakaolin (MK) to give com-posites CanS-FA, CanS-SF, CanS-GGBFS, and CanS-MK, respectively. The analo-gous protocol with SunS likewise yielded SunS-FA, SunS-SF, SunS-GGBFS, and SunS-MK. Each of these HSMs exhibit high compressive mechanical strength, low water uptake values, and exceptional resistance to acid-induced corrosion. All of the composites also exhibit superior compressive strength retention after expo-sure to acidic solutions, conditions under which Portland cement undergoes disso-lution. The polymer cement-pozzolan composites reported herein may thus serve as greener alternatives to traditional Portland cement in some applications.

AB The past decade has witnessed wide applications of machine learning to various domains for decision-making, including crime detection, urban planning, drug discovery, and health monitoring, which benefited from surging data resources. As data collection in real-world applications is often done in different locations, being able to mine and discover knowledge from distributed data sources is an essential requirement for building powerful predictive models. However, directly uploading all data sources to an untrustworthy centralized data server for learning will lead to risks of privacy leakage. Federated Learning (FL) emerges as a decentralized learning framework that aggregates knowledge from distributed data without centralizing them, hence mitigating privacy risks. By hosting this workshop, we aim to attract a broad spectrum of audiences, including researchers and practitioners from academia and industry interested in the latest advances in FL. As an effort to advance the fundamental development of FL in data mining, this workshop will encourage ideas exchange on the trustworthiness, scalability, robustness, and broad applications of FL.

AB Bilateral postural symmetry plays a key role as a potential risk marker for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and as a symptom of congenital muscular torticollis (CMT) in infants, but current methods of assessing symmetry require laborious clinical expert assessments. In this paper, we develop a computer vision based infant symmetry assessment system, leveraging 3D human pose estimation for infants. Evaluation and calibration of our system against ground truth assessments is complicated by our findings from a survey of human ratings of angle and symmetry, that such ratings exhibit low inter-rater reliability. To rectify this, we develop a Bayesian estimator of the ground truth derived from a probabilistic graphical model of fallible human raters. We show that the 3D infant pose estimation model can achieve 68% area under the receiver operating characteristic curve performance in predicting the Bayesian aggregate labels, compared to only 61% from a 2D infant pose estimation model and 60% from a 3D adult pose estimation model, highlighting the importance of 3D poses and infant domain knowledge in assessing infant body symmetry. Our survey analysis also suggests that human ratings are susceptible to higher levels of bias and inconsistency, and hence our final 3D pose-based symmetry assessment system is calibrated but not directly supervised by Bayesian aggregate human ratings, yielding higher levels of consistency and lower levels of inter-limb assessment bias(1).

AB With rapid development in hardware (sensors and processors) and AI algorithms, automated driving techniques have entered the public's daily life and achieved great success in supporting human driving performance. However, due to the high contextual variations and temporal dynamics in pedestrian behaviors, the interaction between autonomous-driving cars and pedestrians remains challenging, impeding the development of fully autonomous driving systems. This pa-per focuses on predicting pedestrian intention with a novel transformer-based evidential prediction (TrEP) algorithm. We develop a transformer module towards the temporal correlations among the input features within pedestrian video sequences and a deep evidential learning model to capture the AI uncertainty under scene complexities. Experimental results on three popular pedestrian intent benchmarks have verified the effectiveness of our proposed model over the state-of-the-art. The algorithm performance can be further boosted by controlling the uncertainty level. We systematically compare human disagreements with AI uncertainty to further evaluate AI performance in confusing scenes. The code is released at https://github.com/zzmonlyyou/TrEP.git.

AB Navigating rigid body objects through crowded environments can be challenging, especially when narrow passages are presented. Existing sampling-based planners and optimization-based methods like mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulations, suffer from limited scalability with respect to either the size of the workspace or the number of obstacles. In order to address the scalability issue, we propose a three-stage algorithm that first generates a graph of convex polytopes in the workspace free of collision, then poses a large set of small MILPs to generate viable paths between polytopes, and finally queries a pair of start and end configurations for a feasible path online. The graph of convex polytopes serves as a decomposition of the free workspace and the number of decision variables in each MILP is limited by restricting the subproblem within two or three free polytopes rather than the entire free region. Our simulation results demonstrate shorter online computation time compared to baseline methods and scales better with the size of the environment and tunnel width than sampling-based planners in both 2D and 3D environments.

AB Continuous ion exchange is a more sustainable alternative to current methods for removing common impurities from lithium sources. In this work, we examine ion- adsorbent interactions for Mg2+ and Ca2+ with microporous titanosilicate ETS-10, an ion exchange solid with promising performance, using experimental and computational (density functional theory, DFT) methods. Ion exchange affinity for Mg2+ and Ca2+ using the Na+-form of ETS-10 are quantified from measured equilibrium isotherms, analyzed using a modified Langmuir isotherm accounting for overall stoichiometric desorption/adsorption in the cation exchange process. The equilibrium constant for ion exchange using Na-ETS-10 is greatest for Ca and decreases in order of Mg, K, and Li, respectively. These differences in ion exchange affinity are consistent with trends in DFT-derived ion exchange energies, which account for hydration and solvation of cations using a thermochemical cycle. These equilibrium constant values and ion exchange energies suggest that exchange of Ca2+, Mg2+, and K+ using Na-ETS-10 is more favorable than that of Li+. Indeed, competitive ion exchange of equimolar aqueous mixtures of Li+ and each of K+, Mg2+, or Ca2+ demonstrate selective uptake of the non-lithium cation into the solid, thereby concentrating Li+ in the aqueous solution while removing impurity cations.

TI Emerging opportunities of using large language models for translation

ID DISCOVERY; GRAPH
AB A drug molecule is a substance that changes an organism's mental or physical state. Every approved drug has an indication, which refers to the therapeutic use of that drug for treating a particular medical condition. While the Large Language Model (LLM), a generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) technique, has recently demonstrated effectiveness in translating between molecules and their textual descriptions, there remains a gap in research regarding their application in facilitating the translation between drug molecules and indications (which describes the disease, condition or symptoms for which the drug is used), or vice versa. Addressing this challenge could greatly benefit the drug discovery process. The capability of generating a drug from a given indication would allow for the discovery of drugs targeting specific diseases or targets and ultimately provide patients with better treatments. In this paper, we first propose a new task, the translation between drug molecules and corresponding indications, and then test existing LLMs on this new task. Specifically, we consider nine variations of the T5 LLM and evaluate them on two public datasets obtained from ChEMBL and DrugBank. Our experiments show the early results of using LLMs for this task and provide a perspective on the state-of-the-art. We also emphasize the current limitations and discuss future work that has the potential to improve the performance on this task. The creation of molecules from indications, or vice versa, will allow for more efficient targeting of diseases and significantly reduce the cost of drug discovery, with the potential to revolutionize the field of drug discovery in the era of generative AI.

   Reinforcement Learning
AB Intelligent robots that are intended to engage with people in real life must be able to adjust to the varying tastes of their users. Robots can be taught personalized behaviors through human-robot collaboration without the need for a laborious, hand-crafted reward function. Instead, robots can learn rewards based on human styles between two robot movements that are called style-based reinforcement learning (SRL). However, existing SRL algorithms suffer from low exploration in the reward and state spaces, low feedback efficiency, and poor performance in complicated interactive tasks. We incorporate past information of the activity into SRL in order to enhance its result. In particular, we separate the activity in human-robot collaboration from the style. We employ an imprecise task reward based on task priori to guide robots in performing more efficient task exploration. Next, the robot's policy is optimized using a learned reward from SRL to better match human styles. Additionally, reward shaping allows for the organic fusion of these two components. The outcomes of the experiment demonstrate that our approach is a workable and efficient means of achieving customized human-robot collaboration.

AB When building classification systems with demographic fairness considerations, there are two objectives to satisfy: 1) maximizing utility for the specific task and 2) ensuring fairness w.r.t. a known demographic attribute. These objectives often compete, so optimizing both can lead to a trade-off between utility and fairness. While existing works acknowledge the trade-offs and study their limits, two questions remain unanswered: 1) What are the optimal trade-offs between utility and fairness? and 2) How can we numerically quantify these trade-offs from data for a desired prediction task and demographic attribute of interest? This paper addresses these questions. We introduce two utility-fairness trade-offs: the Data-Space and Label-Space Trade-off. The trade-offs reveal three regions within the utility-fairness plane, delineating what is fully and partially possible and impossible. We propose U-FaTE, a method to numerically quantify the trade-offs for a given prediction task and group fairness definition from data samples. Based on the trade-offs, we introduce a new scheme for evaluating representations. An extensive evaluation of fair representation learning methods and representations from over 1000 pre-trained models revealed that most current approaches are far from the estimated and achievable fairness-utility trade-offs across multiple datasets and prediction tasks.

DE K-8; culturally responsive computing; culturally relevant pedagogy;
   teacher development; scaffolding
AB The past decade has seen a growing number of culturally relevant K-8 computer science curricula. However, as teachers are the experts on their own classrooms, empowering them to customize instructional materials that draw on the cultural identities and personal experiences of their students can be a powerful strategy. Unfortunately, this process can be challenging and time-consuming.
   Through a series of co-design sessions with 5th-8th grade teachers, we identified challenges teachers face in customizing instructional materials. Our qualitative analysis of these design sessions reveals three primary challenges: (1) completing the customization process in a timely way, (2) preserving the learning objectives of the original curriculum, and (3) meeting personalized culturally responsive teaching goals. In response, we collaboratively and iteratively designed practical and cognitive scaffolds to support teachers in brainstorming and integrating culturally responsive themes specific to their students and classrooms into an existing structured computer science curriculum. This paper presents both the challenges and the scaffolds, contributing a model for supporting teachers in creating customized computing instructional materials for their particular classrooms.

AB Environmental contamination by plastic waste is a growing threat to the environment and human health. Unfortunately, most post-consumer plastics are still disposed of in landfills, even plastics that could be easily recycled via simple chemical processes. This disconnect between technology and implementation is partly due to the economic barrier posed by multi-step processes that convert plastic waste into commodity goods. There is an urgent need for green methods to convert plastic waste directly into marketable commodities via simple processes. Herein we report a simple, single-stage process to chemically recycle poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) to yield composites having thermal and mechanical properties that are competitive with commercial structural materials like Portland cement. In this protocol, a mixture of PET and geraniol are heated with elemental sulfur. In this process, transesterification between geraniol and PET with concomitant thiocracking of the PET backbone leads to the formation of a highly-crosslinked sulfur-PET-geraniol (SPG) network composite. The composite exhibited compressive strength (23.1 MPa) greater than that required for Portland cement to be used in building foundations. This new, single-stage chemical recycling strategy thus employs a bio-olefin and waste sulfur to convert PET waste into a durable composite that could serve as a sustainable alternative to traditional cements.

DE CS teachers; teaching identity; racial identity; discourse analysis
AB Motivation. Teachers can play a role in disrupting social inequities that are reflected in education, such as racial disparities in who succeeds in CS. Professional learning addressing inequities causes teachers to confront difficult topics, including how their own identities impact these problems. Understanding the differing ways teachers' identities surface can provide insights into designing better supports for their professional learning.
   Objectives. The goal of this paper is to examine the teaching and racial identities of two secondary CS teachers who participated in professional learning focused on combining CS content and equity pedagogy. The second goal of this paper is to demonstrate how discourse analytic methods can be used to examine interviews and other interactional data.
   Method. Teachers were interviewed individually about their teaching identity, racial identity, and professional learning. Drawing on Bucholtz and Hall's identity and interaction framework, interviews were examined for linguistic and discursive features reflecting positionality (i.e., how identity surfaces through the way individuals present themselves to and are perceived by others) and indexicality (i.e., various ways of referring to an identity).
   Results. Participants used personal deictics, quotative markers, code choice, and affective and epistemic stances when discussing and negotiating their identities with the interviewer. The data reflected ways teachers problematized questions about teaching identity, negotiated tensions in their disciplinary identities, found the topic of race difficult to address, and highlighted other aspects of their identities relevant to understanding and discussing race.
   Discussion.The study provides a demonstration of how discourse analytic methods can reveal nuances of teacher identity that may be overlooked with other qualitative approaches. Findings also revealed how teachers' ethnic identities might be used as a lever in helping teachers discuss the difficult topic of race in education. Discourse analytic methods are encouraged for future CS education research focused on interactional analyses.

AB Video advertisements, either through television or the Internet, play an essential role in modern political campaigns. For over two decades, researchers have studied television video ads by analyzing the hand-coded data from the Wisconsin Advertising Project and its successor, the Wesleyan Media Project (WMP). Unfortunately, manually coding more than a hundred of variables, such as issue mentions, opponent appearance, and negativity, for many videos is a laborious and expensive process. We propose to automatically code campaign advertisement videos. Applying state-of-the-art machine learning methods, we extract various audio and image features from each video file. We show that our machine coding is comparable to human coding for many variables of the WMP datasets. Since many candidates make their advertisement videos available on the Internet, automated coding can dramatically improve the efficiency and scope of campaign advertisement research. Open-source software package is available for implementing the proposed methodology.

AB Teachers' beliefs can have powerful consequences on instructional decisions and student learning. However, little research focuses on how teachers' beliefs about the role of race and gender in mathematics teaching and learning influence educational equity within classrooms. This gap is partly due to the lack of studies focused on variation within classrooms, which in turn is hampered by the lack of instruments designed to measure mathematics-specific equity beliefs. In this study of 313 preservice and practicing elementary teachers, we report evidence of construct validity for the Attributions of Mathematical Excellence Scale. Factor analyses provide support for a four-factor structure, including genetic, social, personal, and educational attributions. The findings suggest that the same system of attribution beliefs underlies both racial and gender prejudice among elementary mathematics teachers. The Attributions of Mathematical Excellence Scale has the potential to provide a useful outcome measure for equity-focused interventions in teacher education and professional development.

AB For predictive models to provide reliable guidance in decision making processes, they are often required to be accurate and robust to distribution shifts. Shortcut learning-where a model relies on spurious correlations or shortcuts to predict the target label-undermines the robustness property, leading to models with poor out-of-distribution accuracy despite good in-distribution performance. Existing work on shortcut learning either assumes that the set of possible shortcuts is known a priori or is discoverable using interpretability methods such as saliency maps, which might not always be true. Instead, we propose a two step approach to (1) efficiently identify relevant shortcuts, and (2) leverage the identified shortcuts to build models that are robust to distribution shifts. Our approach relies on having access to a (possibly) high dimensional set of auxiliary labels at training time, some of which correspond to possible shortcuts. We show both theoretically and empirically that our approach is able to identify a sufficient set of shortcuts leading to more efficient predictors in finite samples.

AB Neutrinos are the most elusive particles of the Standard Model. The physics behind their masses remains unknown and requires introducing new particles and interactions. An elegant solution to this problem is provided by the seesaw mechanism. Typically considered at a high scale, it is potentially testable in gravitational wave experiments by searching for a spectrum from cosmic strings, which offers a rather generic signature across many high-scale seesaw models. Here we consider the possibility of a low-scale seesaw mechanism at the PeV scale, generating neutrino masses within the framework of a model with gauged U(1) lepton number. In this case, the gravitational wave signal at high frequencies arises from a first order phase transition in the early Universe, whereas at low frequencies it is generated by domain wall annihilation, leading to a double-peaked structure in the gravitational wave spectrum. The signals discussed here can be searched for in upcoming experiments, including gravitational wave interferometers, pulsar timing arrays, and astrometry observations.

AB We report the experimental demonstration of an optical differentiation wavefront sensor (ODWS) based on binary pixelated linear and nonlinear amplitude filtering in the far-field. We trained and tested a convolutional neural network that reconstructs the spatial phase map from nonlinear-filter-based ODWS data for which an analytic reconstruction algorithm is not available. It shows accurate zonal retrieval over different magnitudes of wavefronts and on randomly shaped wavefronts. This work paves the way for the implementation of simultaneously sensitive, high dynamic range, and high-resolution wavefront sensing.

AB Research experiences are an integral part of training future scientists and fostering diversity in science. Providing culturally responsive research mentorship, defined as mentorship that incorporates cultural knowledge to improve learning experiences for a particular group, is a critical step in this endeavor. While culturally responsive mentoring is most commonly associated with mentoring students with underrepresented races and ethnicities in the sciences, it can also be helpful for mentees with a diversity of abilities, sexualities, economic backgrounds, and religions. In this essay, we discuss how mentors can provide more culturally responsive mentoring of Muslim research mentees in the sciences. Muslims are a stigmatized minority group in the United States who participate in a religious culture that often differs from the secular culture of science. Notably, there are few resources for how to engage in culturally responsive mentoring of Muslim research mentees. To address this gap, we drew from the extant literature on the challenges that Muslims encounter in the United States, which likely extends to the context of scientific research, and identified potential culturally responsive accommodations in research.

TI De-Exceptionalizing Pandemic Death in the United States: COVID-19's
   Ambiguous and Layered Mourning
SO ANTHROPOLOGICAL QUARTERLY

AB In the spring and early summer of 2020, mainstream media in the United States announced the "death of ritual" as public officials limited communities from gathering to care for their deceased-whether COVID-19 victims or people who happened to die during this first wave of pandemic restriction. From backlogged funeral homes and crematoria to bodies stacked in refrigerated trucks and families scrambling to find their deceased, headlines seemed to augur an unprecedented condition of interrupted or derailed mourning. But how singular was this moment? On the one hand, funeral directors were telling a different story, reminding the deceased and their loved ones of expected ritual care. On the other, of mourning. This piece challenges the characterization of pandemic death in the United States, especially in the first waves of infection, as exceptional because of what it glosses over: the predictability of which bodies and whose lives routinely pay the highest tolls. Instead, we reflect on the temporality of incomplete and curtailed care by juxtaposing the pandemic's seemingly singular chronotope-born from the politicized bodies of the living as much as the dead-with the exigencies of uncertain death that surround missing persons of conflicts and borders. Seemingly punctuated events like wars and pandemics that give rise to aberrant death throw timelines into disarray; they also expose what underlies and endures: longstanding inequities to conditions that secure life in the first place. Thus, challenging this notion of presumed exceptionalism, we argue that the US experience of pandemic death and mourning throws into relief- at least temporarily-its systems of domination and invites a closer look at the intertwining projects of memory and political transformation.

AB Zernike polynomial orthogonality, an established mathematical principle, is leveraged with the Gauss-Legendre quadrature rule in a rapid novel approach to fitting data over a circular domain. This approach provides significantly faster fitting speeds, in the order of thousands of times, while maintaining comparable error rates achieved with conventional least-square fitting techniques. We demonstrate the technique for fitting mid-spatial-frequencies (MSF) prevalent in small-tool-manufacturing typical of aspheric and freeform optics that are poised to soon permeate a wide range of optical technologies.

AB An approach to designing multiconfiguration afocal telescopes is developed and demonstrated. Freeform surfaces are used to maximize the achievable diffraction -limited zoom ratio while staying in a compact volume for a two -position multiconfiguration afocal optical system. The limitations of these systems with three -mirror beam paths are discussed and subsequently overcome by introducing an additional degree of freedom. In a four -mirror beam path system, the goal of a 5x zoom ratio is achieved with a compensated exit pupil and diffraction -limited performance. A significant benefit in optical performance when using freeform surfaces is shown compared to more conventional surface types.

AB The Research Computing and Data team at Clemson University has been working to improve resource utilization on the Palmetto Cluster. We developed a tool we call jobperf to provide users an easy way to view resource usage of jobs. Originally developed for PBS, Slurm support was also added as the Palmetto Cluster transitioned schedulers. Jobperf provides both a CLI and web interface to view real-time, per-node CPU, GPU and memory usage statistics. The tool was developed to be portable, requiring no cluster-wide components and easily installable without administrator intervention. This was tested on five Slurm clusters available through ACCESS-CI in addition to Palmetto, and shown to work well on three of these external systems. We have released the tool to the community as open source and we hope this tool is useful to other institutions.

AB Pedestrian trajectory prediction is a critical component of autonomous driving in urban environments, allowing vehicles to anticipate pedestrian movements and facilitate safer interactions. While egocentric-view-based algorithms can reduce the sensing and computation burdens of 3D scene reconstruction, accurately predicting pedestrian trajectories and interpreting their intentions from this perspective requires a better understanding of the coupled vehicle (camera) and pedestrian motions, which has not been adequately addressed by existing models. In this paper, we present a novel egocentric pedestrian trajectory prediction approach that uses a two-tower structure and multi-modal inputs. One tower, the vehicle module, receives only the initial pedestrian position and ego-vehicle actions and speed, while the other, the pedestrian module, receives additional prior pedestrian trajectory and visual features. Our proposed action-aware loss function allows the two-tower model to decompose pedestrian trajectory predictions into two parts, caused by ego-vehicle movement and pedestrian movement, respectively, even when only trained on combined ego-view motions. This decomposition increases model flexibility and provides a better estimation of pedestrian actions and intentions, enhancing overall performance. Experiments on three publicly available benchmark datasets show that our proposed model outperforms all existing algorithms in ego-view pedestrian trajectory prediction accuracy.

AB Water utilities collect information from various sources to gain continuous insights into the state of drinking water systems. Among the available data types, service problems that customers report are critical sources of information-especially during emergencies-which allow utilities to gage the impact of system operations on the resulting level of service. While some utilities increasingly collect and analyze customer reporting data to track key performance indicators (e.g., total complaints, response times), this information remains largely underutilized in research and practice. Further, little is known about spatial variations in the quantity or types of problems reported, which can indicate disparities in level of service and customer engagement. Here, we identify and compare spatial patterns in customer reporting against technical system performance and evaluate how trends change during emergency events (e.g., natural disasters). Our analysis demonstrates tightly coupled sociotechnical interdependencies between end user populations and drinking water systems. For instance, results reveal the prevalence of service problems in certain areas and show that several sociodemographic character-istics were statistically different in areas with higher or lower reporting levels. Finally, we offer recommenda-tions for incorporating customer data into operational decision making and outreach efforts.

AB Leadership is evolving dynamically from an individual endeavor to shared efforts. This paper aims to advance our understanding of shared leadership in scientific teams. We define three kinds of leaders, junior (10-15), mid (15-20), and senior (20+) based on career age. By considering the combinations of any two leaders, we distinguish shared leadership as "heterogeneous" when leaders are in different age cohorts and "homogeneous" when leaders are in the same age cohort. Drawing on 1,845,351 CS, 254,039 Sociology, and 193,338 Business teams with two leaders in the OpenAlex dataset, we identify that heterogeneous shared leadership brings higher citation impact for teams than homogeneous shared leadership. Specifically, when junior leaders are paired with senior leaders, it significantly increases team citation ranking by 1-2 %, in comparison with two leaders of similar age. We explore the patterns between homogeneous leaders and heterogeneous leaders from team scale, expertise composition, and knowledge recency perspectives. Compared with homogeneous leaders, heterogeneous leaders are more impactful in large teams, have more diverse expertise, and trace both the newest and oldest references.

AB Graph neural networks (GNNs) have brought superb performance to various applications utilizing graph structural data, such as social analysis and fraud detection. The graph links, e.g., social relationships and transaction history, are sensitive and valuable information, which raises privacy concerns when using GNNs. To exploit these vulnerabilities, we propose VertexSerum, a novel graph poisoning attack that increases the effectiveness of graph link stealing by amplifying the link connectivity leakage. To infer node adjacency more accurately, we propose an attention mechanism that can be embedded into the link detection network. Our experiments demonstrate that VertexSerum significantly outperforms the SOTA link inference attack, improving the AUC scores by an average of 9.8% across four real-world datasets and three different GNN structures. Furthermore, our experiments reveal the effectiveness of VertexSerum in both black-box and online learning settings, further validating its applicability in real-world scenarios.

AB Smart cities operate on computational predictive frameworks that collect, aggregate, and utilize data from large-scale sensor networks. However, these frameworks are prone to multiple sources of data and algorithmic bias, which often lead to unfair prediction results. In this work, we first demonstrate that bias persists at a micro-level both temporally and spatially by studying real city data from Chattanooga, TN. To alleviate the issue of such bias, we introduce Fairguard, a micro-level temporal logic-based approach for fair smart city policy adjustment and generation in complex temporal-spatial domains. The Fairguard framework consists of two phases: first, we develop a static generator that is able to reduce data bias based on temporal logic conditions by minimizing correlations between selected attributes. Then, to ensure fairness in predictive algorithms, we design a dynamic component to regulate prediction results and generate future fair predictions by harnessing logic rules. Evaluations show that logic-enabled static Fairguard can effectively reduce biased correlations while dynamic Fairguard can guarantee fairness on protected groups at run-time with minimal impact on overall performance.

ID STATE-SPACE MODELS; DISTRIBUTIONS; SIMULATION
AB Dynamic Linear Models (DLMs) are commonly employed for time series analysis due to their versatile structure, simple recursive updating, ability to handle missing data, and probabilistic forecasting. However, the options for count time series are limited: Gaussian DLMs require continuous data, while Poissonbased alternatives often lack sufficient modeling flexibility. We introduce a novel semiparametric methodology for count time series by warping a Gaussian DLM. The warping function has two components: a (nonparametric) transformation operator that provides distributional flexibility and a rounding operator that ensures the correct support for the discrete data-generating process. We develop conjugate inference for the warped DLM, which enables analytic and recursive updates for the state space filtering and smoothing distributions. We leverage these results to produce customized and efficient algorithms for inference and forecasting, including Monte Carlo simulation for ovine analysis and an optimal particle filter for online inference. This framework unifies and extends a variety of discrete time series models and is valid for natural counts, rounded values, and multivariate observations. Simulation studies illustrate the excellent forecasting capabilities of the warped DLM. The proposed approach is applied to a multivariate time series of daily overdose counts and demonstrates both modeling and computational successes.

AB Lignin, comprising 20%-35% of lignocellulosic biomass, is the second most abundant biopolymer after cellulose. As the bioethanol industry expands, the accumulation of lignin by-products necessitates innovative valorization strategies. This study explores the synthesis and characterization of lignin-derived composites. Specifically, the reaction of 20 wt. % lignin-derived guaiacol or syringol with 80 wt. % elemental sulfur gives composites GS80 and SS80, respectively. The chemical structures of composites were elucidated using GC-MS, 1H NMR, and UV-Vis spectroscopy, revealing the formation of both S-Caryl and S-Calkyl bonds. Thermal and morphological analysis (via TGA, DSC, PXRD, and SEM-EDS) indicated SS80 has higher crystallinity and thermal stability than GS80, attributed to a higher degree of crosslinking and a greater content of dark sulfur. Mechanical testing showed SS80 exhibits superior compressional and flexural strengths, and enhanced Young's modulus and Shore hardness, compared to GS80. Notably, the mechanical strength parameters for SS80 are comparable to those of C62 class bricks used in construction applications. These findings suggest that lignin-derived composites, particularly those incorporating syringol, can provide viable alternatives to traditional materials in various applications, contributing to both waste valorization and sustainable materials science.

AB While free radical polymerization methods are employed frequently to prepare sub-micron polymer particles, we hypothesized that surfactant-free emulsion polymerization (SFEP)1 methodology may prove beneficial for obtaining functional polymer particles by solution polymerization methods that preclude the need for conventional surfactants. To test the effectiveness of SFEP for the preparation of functional colloids, solution polymerization of several monomers, including propargyl acrylate (PA),2 styrene (Sty)3 and tert-butyl acrylate (tBA),4 was performed over a range of monomer ratios and reaction scales. Electron microscopy and infrared spectroscopy were employed to evaluate the outcome of SFEP for particle size, shape, surface anisotropy, and chemical composition. Combining this characterization with optimized SFEP synthesis, we found that spherical polymer particles-homopolymers of PA as well as copolymers-were obtained in the 60-300 nm diameter size range. Successful inclusion of PA enabled the use of the particles in copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition reactions (CuAAc).5 Moreover, electron microscopy characterization with backscattering revealed chemical and shape anisotropies on copolymer particles indicative of monomer phase-separation during particle formation. Overall, the SFEP methodology represents a straightforward, one-pot, bottom-up approach to yield a library of functional polymer particles, while avoiding undesirable aspects associated with conventional surfactants.

AB Abyssal T-waves are seismo-acoustic waves originating from abyssal oceans. Unlike subduction-zone-generated slope T-waves which are generated through multiple reflections between the sea surface and the gently dipping seafloor, the genesis of abyssal T-waves cannot be explained by the same theory. Several hypotheses, including seafloor scattering, sea surface scattering, and internal-wave-induced volumetric scattering, have been proposed to elucidate their genesis and propagation. The elusive mechanism of abyssal T-waves, particularly at low-frequencies, hinders their use to quantify ocean temperatures through seismic ocean thermometry (SOT) and estimate oceanic earthquake parameters. Here, using realistic geophysical and oceanographic data, we first conduct numerical simulations to compare synthetic low-frequency abyssal T-waves under different hypotheses. Our simulations for the Romanche and Blanco transform faults suggest seafloor scattering as the dominant mechanism, with sea surface and internal waves contributing marginally. Short-scale bathymetry can significantly enhance abyssal T-waves across a broad frequency range. Also, observed T-waves from repeating earthquakes in the Romanche, Chain, and Blanco transform faults exhibit remarkably high repeatability. Given the dynamic nature of sea surface roughness and internal waves, the highly repeatable T-wave arrivals further support the seafloor scattering as the primary mechanism. The dominance of seafloor scattering makes abyssal T-waves useable for constraining ocean temperature changes, thereby greatly expanding the data spectrum of SOT. Our observations of repeating abyssal T-waves in the Romanche and Chain transform faults could provide a valuable data set for understanding Equatorial Atlantic warming. Still, further investigations incorporating high-resolution bathymetry are warranted to better model abyssal T-waves for earthquake parameter estimation.

AB Racial stereotypes are salient to Black adolescents and to the academic domain of mathematics; however, few studies have examined the socio-cognitive mechanisms through which racial stereotypes impact math achievement. This 2-year longitudinal study (N = 790 Grade 6, 8, and 10 students during Year 1; 50.7% girls and 49.3% boys) investigated (a) the extent to which the endorsement of positively and negatively biased racial stereotypes predicted Black adolescents' math performance through their cognitive engagement and ability mindset and (b) whether gender and ethnic-racial identity moderated these links. Results suggested that endorsement of negatively biased stereotypes was associated with diminished cognitive engagement and lower math scores across 2 years (p < .05). Additionally, adolescents' ethnic-racial identity commitment moderated the negative links between stereotype endorsement and math cognitive engagement in Year 2 (p < .05). When considering the mediating role of math ability mindsets, the endorsement of both positively and negatively biased racial stereotypes operated on math performance via its links to stronger fixed ability mindset beliefs in both years (p < .05). Gender also moderated the effects of racial stereotype endorsement on math mindset beliefs in Year 1 (p < .01). This study's findings advance the field's understanding of the psychosocial mechanisms through which racial stereotypes operate, thus enabling educators to develop tailored practices that facilitate equitable access to math learning opportunities.

AB Two new qubit stabilizer codes with parameters [77,0,19](2) and [90,0,22](2) are constructed for the first time by employing additive symplectic self-dual F-4 codes from multidimensional circulant (MDC) graphs. We completely classify MDC graph codes for lengths 4 <= n <= 40 and show that many optimal [l, 0, d] qubit codes can be obtained from the MDC construction. Moreover, we prove that adjacency matrices of MDC graphs have nested block circulant structure and determine isomorphism properties of MDC graphs. (c) 2024 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, a new type of multifunctional materials (MFMs) called self-regenerative Ni-doped CaTiO3/CaO is introduced for the integrated CO2 capture and dry reforming of methane (ICCDRM). These materials consist of a catalytically active Ni-doped CaTiO3 and a CO2 sorbent, CaO. The article proposes a concept where the Ni catalyst can be regenerated in situ, which is crucial for ICCDRM. Exsolved Ni nanoparticles are evenly distributed on the surface of CaTiO3 under H-2 or CH4, and are re-dispersed back into the CaTiO3 lattice under CO2. The Ni-doped CaTiO3/CaO MFMs show stable CO2 capture capacity and syngas productivity for 30 cycles of ICCDRM. The presence of CaTiO(3 )between CaO grains prevents CaO/CaCO3 thermal sintering during carbonation and decarbonation. Moreover, the strong interaction of CaTiO3 with exsolved Ni mitigates severe accumulation of coke deposition. This concept can be useful for developing MFMs with improved properties that can advance integrated carbon capture and conversion.

AB A student's sense of belonging in computing can be positively impacted when coursework can authentically be connected to real community contexts. We describe the design, materials, and preliminary evaluation of an introductory programming (CS0) course infused with a focus on societal responsibility and relevance. We take a data-centric, constructionist approach to introductory computing. Data-centricity allows us to authentically connect coursework with students' communal and societal interests, and students' motivation was enhanced given that they were creating and sharing artifacts as part of their coursework. Students used TypeScript to manipulate and analyze real data-sets, and created shareable websites containing statistics, data visualizations, and reflections based on the data-set of their choosing. Students chose varied topics for their assignments-they worked with data about access to CS education, climate change, and data provided by local non-profit organizations. A preliminary evaluation indicated that students who took this CS0 course attained CS-specific learning objectives equally well in the two subsequent follow-on courses as students who took alternative CS0 courses at our University. We close with instructor perspectives and reflections on lessons learned.

AB Congestion tollings have been widely developed and adopted as an effective tool to mitigate urban traffic congestion and enhance transportation system sustainability. Nevertheless, these tolling schemes are often tailored on a city-by-city or even area-by-area basis, and the cost of conducting field experiments often makes the design and evaluation process challenging. In this work, we leverage MATSim, a simulation platform that provides microscopic behaviors at the agent level, to evaluate performance on tolling schemes. Specifically, we conduct a case study of the Manhattan Central Business District (CBD) in New York City (NYC) using a fine-granularity traffic network model in the large-scale agent behavior setting. The flexibility of MATSim enables the implementation of a customized tolling policy proposed yet not deployed by the NYC agency while providing detailed interpretations. The quantitative and qualitative results indicate that the tested tolling program can regulate the personal vehicle volume in the CBD area and encourage the usage of public transportation, which proves to be a practical move towards sustainable transportation systems. More importantly, our work demonstrates that agent-based simulation helps better understand the travel pattern change subject to tollings in dense and complex urban environments, and it has the potential to facilitate efficient decision-making for the devotion to sustainable traffic management.

AB As discussions around 6G begin, it is important to carefully quantify the spectral efficiency gains actually realized by deployed 5G networks as compared to 4G through various enhancements such as higher modulation, beamforming, and MIMO. This will inform the design of future cellular systems, especially in the mid-bands, which provide a good balance between bandwidth and propagation. Similar to 4G, 5G also utilizes low-band (<1 GHz) and mid-band spectrum (1 to 6 GHz), and hence comparing the performance of 4G and 5G in these bands will provide insights into how further performance improvements can be attained. In this work, we address a crucial question: is the performance boost in 5G compared to 4G primarily a result of increased bandwidth, or do the other enhancements play significant roles, and if so, under what circumstances? There is extremely limited academic research that addresses this important question. Hence, we conduct city-wide measurements of 4G and 5G cellular networks deployed in low- and mid-bands in Chicago and Minneapolis, and carefully analyze the performance to quantify the contributions of different aspects of 5G advancements to its improved throughput performance. Our analyses show that (i) compared to 4G, the throughput improvement in 5G today is mainly influenced by the wider channel bandwidth, both from single channels and channel aggregation, (ii) in addition to wider channels, improved 5G throughput requires better signal conditions, which can be delivered by denser deployment and/or use of beamforming in mid-bands, (iii) the channel rank in real-world environments rarely supports the full 4 layers of 4x4 MIMO and (iv) advanced features such as MU-MIMO and higher order modulation such as 1024-QAM have yet to be widely deployed. These observations and conclusions lead one to consider designing the next generation of cellular systems to have wider channels, perhaps with improved channel aggregation, a deployment architecture that is dense and uses more beams, thus ensuring uniformly better signal strength over the coverage area and no more than 4 MIMO layers per user.

AB The need for citizens to better understand the ethical and social challenges of algorithmic systems has led to a rapid proliferation of AI literacy initiatives. After reviewing the literature on AI literacy projects, we found that most educational practices in this area are based on teaching programming fundamentals, primarily to K-12 students. This leaves out citizens and those who are primarily interested in understanding the implications of automated decision- making systems, rather than in learning to code. To address these gaps, this article explores the methodological contributions of responsible AI education practices that focus first on stakeholders when designing learning experiences for different audiences and contexts. The article examines the weaknesses identified in current AI literacy projects, explains the stakeholder-first approach, and analyzes several responsible AI education case studies, to illustrate how such an approach can help overcome the aforementioned limitations. The results suggest that the stakeholder-first approach allows to address audiences beyond the usual ones in the field of AI literacy, and to incorporate new content and methodologies depending on the needs of the respective audiences, thus opening new avenues for teaching and research in the field.

AB What is the effect on students' learning of converting a narrated slideshow with simple line drawings (original group) into one in which the key elements are rendered as colorful cartoon-like characters (cartoon group)? We conducted two between-subjects experiments in which the narrator's voice in both groups was a computer -generated female happy voice in Experiment 1 or a real female happy voice in Experiment 2. The cartoon group scored higher on a transfer posttest than the original group in both experiments. On subsequent ques-tionnaires, the cartoon group reported feeling more positive (i.e., happy and content) during learning than the original group (in Experiment 1 and the combined experiments); and reported that the instructor was more engaging, better at facilitating learning, and more human-like (in Experiment 2 and the combined experiments). The results are consistent with the positivity principle, which predicts better learning from lessons in which key elements induce positive emotions.

AB This literature review examines the existing research into cybersickness reduction with regards to head mounted display use. Cybersickness refers to a collection of negative symptoms sometimes experienced as the result of being immersed in a virtual environment, such as nausea, dizziness, or eye strain. These symptoms can prevent individuals from utilizing virtual reality (VR) technologies, so discovering new methods of reducing them is critical. Our objective in this literature review is to provide a better picture of what cybersickness reduction techniques exist, the quantity of research demonstrating their effectiveness, and the virtual scenes testing has taken place in. This will help to direct researches towards promising avenues, and illuminate gaps in the literature. Following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses statement, we obtained a batch of 1,055 papers through the use of software aids. We selected 88 papers that examine potential cybersickness reduction approaches. Our acceptance criteria required that papers examined malleable conditions that could be conceivably modified for everyday use, examined techniques in conjunction with head mounted displays, and compared cybersickness levels between two or more user conditions. These papers were sorted into categories based on their general approach to combating cybersickness, and labeled based on the presence of statistically significant results, the use of virtual vehicles, the level of visual realism, and the virtual scene contents used in evaluation of their effectiveness. In doing this we have created a snapshot of the literature to date so that researchers may better understand what approaches are being researched, and the types of virtual experiences used in their evaluation. Keywords: Virtual reality cybersickness Simulator Sickness Visually induced motion sickness reduction Systematic review Head mounted display.

AB We investigate the prospects for probing asymmetric dark matter models through their gravitational wave signatures. We concentrate on a theory extending the Standard Model gauge symmetry by a nonAbelian group, under which leptons form doublets with new fermionic partners, one of them being a dark matter candidate. The breaking of this new symmetry occurs at a high scale and results in a strong first order phase transition in the early universe. The model accommodates baryogenesis in an asymmetric dark matter setting and predicts a gravitational wave signal within the reach of near-future experiments.

TI Filtering with degenerate observation noise: A stochastic approximation
   approach
SO AUTOMATICA
LA English
DT Article
DE Filtering; Degenerate observation noise; Stochastic approximation
AB This paper is concerned with a general filtering scheme of a continuous-time dynamic system in which the state is not completely observable. The observation process consists of a function of the state with additive noise. Typically, such noise is assumed to be non-degenerate. In this case, various filtering schemes can be developed. For example, in a linear case, the Kalman-Bucy (KB) filter applies and leads to a recursive filtering equation for the conditional expectation of the state given the observation up to time t. Nevertheless, in applications, only some state variables are directly observable and the rest are not. This gives rise to filtering with degenerate observation noise. In this case, traditional filtering schemes fail. This paper develops a viable scheme to address possible degenerate observation noise. In this paper, we propose a recursive filtering equation in which the gain matrix is a matrix-valued parameter to be determined. We adopt the Monte Carlo training procedure used for deep filtering to determine the best gain matrix. In particular, given the state and observation equations, we generate their Monte Carlo samples. Given a gain matrix, we generate the corresponding state estimation samples, which leads to the error function of the state and its estimation. The problem is to choose the gain matrix to minimize the error function. We develop a stochastic approximation method for such a minimization task; we term the procedure the SA filter, where SA stands for stochastic approximation. We focus on computational experiments and demonstrate the performance of the SA filter and its robustness. We also compare the SA filter with the (extended) Kalman-Bucy filter and the deep filter in both linear and nonlinear models. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Despite the growing availability of classroom measures, such measures rarely attended to the embodied nature of learning. This article describes the collaborative development of a practical measure to capture embodied participation in mathematics classrooms with four elementary school teachers-working with students at the intersections of multiply marginalized identities: students of color, emergent bilinguals, and students with disabilities-who informed the measure design and ensured that the data were actionable in their contexts. This article contributes to existing research on classroom measures by highlighting the value of attending to embodied learning through multiple modalities and representations of student participation. We further highlight how such a measure provides practical insights into participation that extend beyond verbal only measures.

AB Inaccurate sex and gender narratives have saturated the political landscape, resulting in legal restrictions for people with queer genders. Biology educators can correct these false narratives by teaching scientifically accurate and queer gender and intersex inclusive sex and gender curriculum. Here, we interviewed four undergraduate biology instructors who were working to reform their sex and gender curriculum. Using their reformed curriculum to promote conversation in the interviews, we asked participants about their curriculum, their reform process, and the obstacles they faced in implementing their reformed curriculum. We noticed the instructors' journeys to reforming involved intense personal work and education, both at the beginning and iteratively throughout implementation. We found instructors focused on changing language and using a variety of inclusive activities in their undergraduate biology classroom, ranging from highlighting scientists with queer genders to assigning students to research the experiences of people with queer genders with adolescent hormone therapy. Instructors mentioned obstacles to implementing reformed curriculum, including fear of potentially isolating students and concern about the instructor's own positionality. Removing obstacles and supporting the process of unlearning exclusive ways of teaching sex and gender topics may bolster instructor efforts to provide more accurate and inclusive biology education.

AB Non-consensual Intimate Media (NCIM) refers to the distribution of sexual or intimate content without consent. NCIM is common and causes significant emotional, financial, and reputational harm. We developed Hands-Off, an interaction technique for messaging applications that deters non-consensual screenshots. Hands-Off requires recipients to perform a hand gesture in the air, above the device, to unlock media-which makes simultaneous screenshotting difficult. A lab study shows that Hands-Off gestures are easy to perform and reduce non-consensual screenshots by 67%. We conclude by generalizing this approach and introduce the idea of Feminist Interaction Techniques (FIT), interaction techniques that encode feminist values and speak to societal problems, and reflect on FIT's opportunities and limitations.

AB Unsteady computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are essential in aerospace engineering because they can provide high-fidelity flow fields to better understand transient physics, such as vortex shedding. However, unsteady full-order CFD simulations must repeatedly march the flow solution with a small time step and are computationally expensive. Reduced-order modeling (ROM) is a powerful approach to alleviate the above issue by decomposing the unsteady flow solutions into spatial modes and temporal coefficients, making the unsteady flow easier to simulate. Existing ROM studies mostly focused on parametric problems that use a large number of simulation samples to train an offline model (parametric ROM). Although the trained model can quickly predict any flow fields within the parameter space, the computational cost for generating the massive unsteady simulation samples is still high, especially when the number of parameters and their ranges increase. To further address the high-cost issue, we develop an efficient predictive ROM approach to accelerate individual unsteady aerodynamic simulations. We use the Galerkin projection approach to reduce the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations, along with the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) for decreasing the computation cost for nonlinear terms. In addition, we develop an efficient ROM formulation that correlates the temporal coefficients between the momentum, pressure, and turbulence equations, allowing solving fewer ROM equations at the prediction stage. The intrusive nature of the predictive ROM enables using the first portion of unsteady flow data to accelerate the rest of the simulation; no massive offline samples are needed. We use the stalled turbulent flow over the NACA0012 airfoil as the benchmark and evaluate the predictive ROM's speed and accuracy for challenging non-equilibrium scenarios caused by a large sudden change in flow conditions. The run time ratios between CFD and ROM (including the calculation of basis vectors and projection matrices) range between 13 and 45. The pressure, drag, lift, pitching moment, and flow fields simulated by the ROM approach agree reasonably well with the CFD references at various times. The proposed predictive ROM approach is, in principle, applicable to different airfoil geometries and flow conditions and can be integrated into a design optimization process for accelerating unsteady aerodynamic simulations.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB Herein we report a method for the chemical recycling of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) by a three-stage process employing sustainably-sourced organic materials and industrial byproduct sulfur. In this protocol, PET was subject to glycolysis with diethylene glycol to yield low molecular weight oligomers with hydroxyl end groups. The glycolyzed PET (GPET) was then reacted with oleoyl chloride to yield esterified PET (EPET) containing vulcanizable olefin units. The oligomers constituting GPET and EPET were elucidated by MALDI-TOF spectrometry. EPET underwent inverse vulcanization with elemental sulfur (90 wt%) for 35 min or 24 h to yield xPES or mPES, respectively. The composition, thermal, morphological, thermal and mechanical properties were characterized. The composites exhibited good to excellent mechanical properties that were improved significantly by extending the reaction time from 35 min used to prepare xPES (compressive strength = 10.5 MPa, flexural strength = 2.7 MPa) to 24 h used to prepare mPES (compressive strength = 26.9 MPa, flexural strength = 7.7 MPa). Notably, the compressive and flexural strengths of mPES represent 158% and 208% of the values required for residential building foundations made from traditional materials such as ordinary Portland cement. The three-stage approach delineated herein thus represents a way to mediate chemical recycling of waste plastic with green coreagents to yield composites having mechanical properties competitive with existing commercial structural materials.

ID PREDICTION; SEQUENCE
AB Recent improvements in computational and experimental techniques for obtaining protein structures have resulted in an explosion of 3D coordinate data. To cope with the ever-increasing sizes of structure databases, this work proposes the Protein Data Compression (PDC) format, which compresses coordinates and temperature factors of full-atomic and Ca-only protein structures. Without loss of precision, PDC results in 69% to 78% smaller file sizes than Protein Data Bank (PDB) and macromolecular Crystallographic Information File (mmCIF) files with standard GZIP compression. It uses similar to 60% less space than existing compression algorithms specific to macromolecular structures. PDC optionally performs lossy compression with minimal sacrifice of precision, which allows reduction of file sizes by another 79%. Conversion between PDC, mmCIF and PDB formats is typically achieved within 0.02 s. The compactness and fast reading/writing speed of PDC make it valuable for storage and analysis of large quantity of tertiary structural data.Database URL

ID DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS
AB Mental health informatics is the use of data science tools to improve mental health outcomes. Binge drinking is tied to several negative mental health outcomes including increased severity of anxiety and depression symptoms. Many existing methods of identifying binge drinking risk factors fail to account for data heterogeneity within a population. To address this limitation, we formulate a subpopulation binge drinking behavioral risk factors ranking problem, under the framework of multi-task learning (MTL). This outputs a ranked list of binge drinking behavioral risk factors for each subpopulation (task) concurrently while incorporating shared data across tasks. We then analyzed the ranked lists of risk factors and compared the top ranking factors for each MTL setting. We conclude that MTL can be effectively used to obtain risk factors for binge drinking and suggest future research directions.

AB Automatic remote sensing tools can help inform many large-scale challenges such as disaster management, climate change, etc. While a vast amount of spatio-temporal satellite image data is readily available, most of it remains unlabelled. Without labels, this data is not very useful for supervised learning algorithms. Self-supervised learning instead provides a way to learn effective representations for various downstream tasks without labels. In this work, we leverage characteristics unique to satellite images to learn better self-supervised features. Specifically, we use the temporal signal to contrast images with long-term and short-term differences, and we leverage the fact that satellite images do not change frequently. Using these characteristics, we formulate a new loss contrastive loss called Change-Aware Contrastive (CACo) Loss. Further, we also present a novel method of sampling different geographical regions. We show that leveraging these properties leads to better performance on diverse downstream tasks. For example, we see a 6.5% relative improvement for semantic segmentation and an 8.5% relative improvement for change detection over the best-performing baseline with our method.

DE Out-Domain Detection; Uncertainty Estimation
AB Robust out-domain uncertainty estimation has gained growing attention for its capacity of providing adversary-resistant uncertainty estimates on out-domain samples. However, existing work on robust uncertainty estimation mainly focuses on evasion attacks that happen during test time. The threat of poisoning attacks against uncertainty models is largely unexplored. Compared to evasion attacks, poisoning attacks do not necessarily modify test data, and therefore, would be more practical in real-world applications. In this work, we systematically investigate the robustness of state-of-the-art uncertainty estimation algorithms against data poisoning attacks, with the ultimate objective of developing robust uncertainty training methods. In particular, we focus on attacking the out-domain uncertainty estimation. Under the proposed attack, the training process of models is affected. A fake high-confidence region is established around the targeted out-domain sample, which originally would have been rejected by the model due to low confidence. More fatally, our attack is clean-label and targeted: it leaves the poisoned data with clean labels and attacks a specific targeted test sample without degrading the overall model performance. We evaluate the proposed attack on several image benchmark datasets and a real-world application of COVID-19 misinformation detection. The extensive experimental results on different tasks suggest that the state-of-the-art uncertainty estimation methods could be extremely vulnerable and easily corrupted by our proposed attack.

AB The software-based implementation of differential privacy mechanisms has been shown to be neither friendly for lightweight devices nor secure against side-channel attacks. In this work, we aim to develop a hardware-based technique to achieve differential privacy by design. In contrary to the conventional software-based noise generation and injection process, our design realizes local differential privacy (LDP) by harnessing the inherent hardware noise into controlled LDP noise when data is stored in the memory. Specifically, the noise is tamed through a novel memory design and power downscaling technique, which leads to double-faceted gains in privacy and power efficiency. A well-round study that consists of theoretical design and analysis and chip implementation and experiments is presented. The results confirm that the developed technique is differentially private, saves 88.58% system power, speeds up software-based DP mechanisms by more than 10(6) times, while only incurring 2.46% chip overhead and 7.81% estimation errors in data recovery.

AB Collective migration of eukaryotic cells is often guided by chemotaxis, and is critical in several biological processes, such as cancer metastasis, wound healing, and embryogenesis. Understanding collective chemotaxis has challenged experimental, theoretical and computational scientists because cells can sense very small chemoattractant gradients that are tightly controlled by cell-cell interactions and the regulation of the chemoattractant distribution by the cells. Computational models of collective cell migration that offer a high-fidelity resolution of the cell motion and chemoattractant dynamics in the extracellular space have been limited to a small number of cells. Here, we present Dynamic cluster field modeling (DCF), a novel computational method that enables simulations of collective chemotaxis of cellular systems with O(1000)\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${\mathcal {O}}(1000)$$\end{document} cells and high-resolution transport dynamics of the chemoattractant in the time-evolving extracellular space. We illustrate the efficiency and predictive capabilities of our approach by comparing our numerical simulations with experiments in multiple scenarios that involve chemoattractant secretion and uptake by the migrating cells, cell migration in confined spaces, regulation of the attractant distribution by cell motion, and interactions of the chemoattractant with an enzyme. The proposed algorithm opens new opportunities to address outstanding problems that involve collective cell migration in the central nervous system, immune response and cancer metastasis.

AB This practice brief describes a model for pursuing student-led institutional change focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion. While the literature emphasizes the importance of student agency, most diversity and educational initiatives still tend to happen to or for students rather than in partnership with them. Meanwhile, student organizations and student activism are legitimately helping improve the university but amount to uncompensated labor. We highlight the Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Ambassador program, which engages undergraduate engineering students in efforts of student-led institutional change focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion in higher engineering education. Informed by Youth Participatory Action Research, we discuss the challenges and insights associated with five main aspects of the program: (1) monetary support, (2) student selection, (3) training, (4) mentored project work, and (5) impact and communication with the community. Finally, we provide implications from the Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Ambassador program for higher education and engineering education diversity support programs.

AB We prove two compactness results for function spaces with finite Dirichlet energy of half-space nonlocal gradients. In each of these results, we provide sufficient conditions on a sequence of kernel functions that guarantee the asymptotic compact embedding of the associated nonlocal function spaces into the class of square-integrable functions. Moreover, we will demonstrate that the sequence of nonlocal function spaces converges in an appropriate sense to a limiting function space. As an application, we prove uniform Poincar & eacute;-type inequalities for sequence of half-space gradient operators. We also apply the compactness result to demonstrate the convergence of appropriately parameterized nonlocal heterogeneous anisotropic diffusion problems. We will construct asymptotically compatible schemes for these type of problems. Another application concerns the convergence and robust discretization of a nonlocal optimal control problem.

AB Arterial pulse wave monitoring has been recognized as an effective medical diagnostic tool for various cardiovascular diseases. To overcome the barriers in traditional, complex, and expensive detection configurations, new electronic and optical sensors have been developed with their unique advantages. Particularly, various configurations of fiber-optic sensors have been proposed. This paper demonstrates the use of a tapered optical fiber structure to create a sensitive sensor that can detect carotid arterial pulse waves on the skin surface. The demonstrated fiber sensor probe utilizes an in-line Mach-Zehnder interferometer configuration and liquid-gold film coating on the sensor tip to enhance its sensitivity and demonstrate its use by encapsulating the sensor with a flexible elastomer material for detecting arterial pulse waves with a simple testing configuration. Considering the simple fabrication and high sensitivity without a complex demodulation scheme, the proposed sensor has broad implementation in biomedical health monitoring systems.

ID SOCIOTRANSFORMATIVE CONSTRUCTIVISM; SCIENCE; TIME
AB This 2-year qualitative case study focuses on one emergent mathematics teacher leader, Mr. Miller, and his conceptualization of Social Justice Mathematics (SJM). SJM is a justice-oriented pedagogical approach where students simultaneously learn dominant mathematics and explore social injustices to take action toward justice. Using Rodriguez's (Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 1998, 35, 589-622) sociotransformative constructivism framework, findings illuminate how dialogic conversation, authentic activity, and metacognition supported Mr. Miller's reflexivity about his positionality, which he described as "upper middle class, highly educated parents, white, male," in relationship to his students' positionality. He taught in a public charter high school in an urban city in the Northeast United States, where approximately 60% of students identified as Black, 30% white, 10% mixed race, 1% Asian American, 1% Latine, and less than 1% Indigenous, with 60% of students qualifying for free or reduced lunch. The article discusses of the importance of reflexivity for teachers and teacher leaders of all backgrounds, and especially when educators of dominant backgrounds work with students of historically marginalized backgrounds. The article calls for further research with more experienced mathematics teacher leaders of various backgrounds and contexts to further investigate justice-centered mathematics teacher leadership.

AB With populations of threatened and endangered species declining worldwide, efforts are being made to generate high quality genomic records of these species before they are lost forever. Here, we demonstrate that data from single Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) MinION flow cells can, even in the absence of highly accurate short DNA-read polishing, produce high quality de novo plant genome assemblies adequate for downstream analyses, such as synteny and ploidy evaluations, paleodemographic analyses, and phylogenomics. This study focuses on three North American ash tree species in the genus Fraxinus (Oleaceae) that were recently added to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List as critically endangered. Our results support a hexaploidy event at the base of the Oleaceae as well as a subsequent whole genome duplication shared by Syringa, Osmanthus, Olea, and Fraxinus. Finally, we demonstrate the use of ONT long-read sequencing data to reveal patterns in demographic history.

AB Deep learning (DL) has proven to be effective in detecting sophisticated malware that is constantly evolving. Even though deep learning has alleviated the feature engineering problem, finding the most optimal DL model's architecture and set of hyper-parameters, remains a challenge that requires domain expertise. In addition, many of the proposed state-of-the-art models are very complex and may not be the best fit for different datasets. A promising approach, known as Automated Machine Learning (AutoML), can reduce the domain expertise required to develop custom DL models by automating the ML pipeline key components, namely hyperparameter optimization and neural architecture search (NAS). AutoML reduces the amount of human trial-and-error involved in designing DL models, and in more recent implementations can find new model architectures with relatively low computational overhead.Research on the feasibility of using AutoML for malware detection is very limited. This work provides a comprehensive analysis and insights on using AutoML for both static and online malware detection. For static, our analysis is performed on two widely used malware datasets: SOREL-20M to demonstrate efficacy on large datasets; and EMBER-2018, a smaller dataset specifically curated to hinder the performance of machine learning models. In addition, we show the effects of tuning the NAS process parameters on finding a more optimal malware detection model on these static analysis datasets. Further, we also demonstrate that AutoML is performant in online malware detection scenarios using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for cloud IaaS. We compare an AutoML technique to six existing state-of-the-art CNNs using a newly generated online malware dataset with and without other applications running in the background during malware execution. We show that the AutoML technique is more performant than the state-of-the-art CNNs with little overhead in finding the architecture. In general, our experimental results show that the performance of AutoML based static and online malware detection models are on par or even better than state-of-the-art models or hand-designed models presented in literature.

DE response process; latent variable; hidden Markov models; problem-solving

AB Response process data from computer-based problem-solving items describe respondents' problem-solving processes as sequences of actions. Such data provide a valuable source for understanding respondents' problem-solving behaviors. Recently, data-driven feature extraction methods have been developed to compress the information in unstructured process data into relatively low-dimensional features. Although the extracted features can be used as covariates in regression or other models to understand respondents' response behaviors, the results are often not easy to interpret since the relationship between the extracted features, and the original response process is often not explicitly defined. In this paper, we propose a statistical model for describing response processes and how they vary across respondents. The proposed model assumes a response process follows a hidden Markov model given the respondent's latent traits. The structure of hidden Markov models resembles problem-solving processes, with the hidden states interpreted as problem-solving subtasks or stages. Incorporating the latent traits in hidden Markov models enables us to characterize the heterogeneity of response processes across respondents in a parsimonious and interpretable way. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed model through simulation experiments and case studies of PISA process data.

AB Nickel-based superalloys (Ni-alloys) are widely used in flight critical aeroengine components because of their excellent material properties at high temperatures such as yield strength, ductility, and creep resistance. However, these desirable high-temperature properties also make Ni-alloys very difficult to machine. This paper provides an overview and benchmarking of various constitutive models to provide the process modeling community with an objective comparison between various calibrated material models to increase the accuracy of process model predictions for machining of Ni-alloys. Various studies involving the Johnson-Cook model and the calibration of its constants in finite element simulations are discussed. It was found that significant discrepancies exist between researchers' approaches to calibrating constitutive models. To this end, various "physics-based" models are discussed as an alternative to widely used "phenomenological" models like the Johnson-Cook model, supplemented by a discussion on the more precise inverse method for constitutive model calibration. This paper also provides a comprehensive overview of pedigreed physical material properties for a range of Ni-alloys-the variation of thermal properties and thermally induced stresses over machining temperature regimes are modeled for a variety of Ni-alloys. The chemical compositions and applications for a range of relevant Ni-alloys are also explored. Overall, this paper identifies the need for more comprehensive analysis and process-specific (e.g., in-situ) characterization of thermomechanical properties for difficult-to-machine Ni-alloys to improve machining performance and aeroengine component quality.

AB A volume-varying stirred tank with a free-piston are placed in front of DuPont's Closed-Circuit RO (CCRO) system to achieve improved energetics. Valves are used to direct fluid flow and piston motion to enable cyclic operations consisting of CC filtration and flushing steps. Similar to CCRO, overall system recovery in the proposed system is controlled by the CC/flushing time ratio, and uninterrupted permeate production is possible if the flushing is done at high pressures. Spatiotemporal system-level models are developed and formulated as a set of coupled partial differential equations (PDEs) and ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Detailed numerical simulations and parametric studies are carried out to explore the flow and mass transfer characteristics and to compare its performance at the cyclic steady-state (CSS) with the original CCRO and the conventional steady-state RO.

ID STYLE; MODEL
AB Variation in muscular tension has important expressive impacts on agent motion; however, it is difficult to tune simulations to achieve particular effects. With a focus on gesture animation, we introduce mass trackers, a lightweight approach that employs proportional derivative control to track point masses that define the position of each wrist. The restriction to point masses allows the derivation of response functions that support straightforward tuning of system behavior. Using the point mass as an end-effector for an inverse kinematics rig allows easy control of both loose and high tension arm motion. Examples illustrate the expressive variation that can be achieved with this tension modulation. Two perceptual studies confirm that these changes impact the overall level of tension perceived in the motion of a gesturing character and further explore the parameter space. Practical guidelines on tuning are discussed.

AB BackgroundThe ability to maintain attention is crucial for achieving success in various aspects of life, including academic pursuits, career advancement, and social interactions. Attention deficit disorder (ADD) is a common symptom associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which can pose challenges for individuals affected by it, impacting their social interactions and learning abilities. To address this issue, virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a promising tool for attention training with the ability to create personalized virtual worlds, providing a conducive platform for attention-focused interventions. Furthermore, leveraging physiological data can be instrumental in the development and enhancement of attention-training techniques for individuals.MethodsIn our preliminary study, a functional prototype for attention therapy systems was developed. In the current phase, the objective is to create a framework called VR-PDA (Virtual Reality Physiological Data Analysis) that utilizes physiological data for tracking and improving attention in individuals. Four distinct training strategies such as noise, score, object opacity, and red vignette are implemented in this framework. The primary goal is to leverage virtual reality technology and physiological data analysis to enhance attentional capabilities.ResultsOur data analysis results revealed that reinforcement training strategies are crucial for improving attention in individuals with ASD, while they are not significant for non-autistic individuals. Among all the different strategies employed, the noise strategy demonstrates superior efficacy in training attention among individuals with ASD. On the other hand, for Non-ASD individuals, no specific training proves to be effective in enhancing attention. The total gazing time feature exhibited benefits for participants with and without ASD.DiscussionThe results consistently demonstrated favorable outcomes for both groups, indicating an enhanced level of attentiveness. These findings provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of different strategies for attention training and emphasize the potential of virtual reality (VR) and physiological data in attention training programs for individuals with ASD. The results of this study open up new avenues for further research and inspire future developments.

ID VALUES; MICE
AB Deep learning models have been recently proposed in the applications of missing data imputation. In this paper, we review the popular statistical, machine learning, and deep learning approaches, and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these methods. We conduct a comprehensive numerical study to compare the performance of several widely-used imputation methods for incomplete tabular (structured) data. Specifically, we compare the deep learning methods: generative adversarial imputation networks (GAIN) with onehot encoding, GAIN with embedding, variational auto-encoder (VAE) with onehot encoding, and VAE with embedding versus two conventional methods: multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE) and missForest. Seven real benchmark datasets and three simulated datasets are considered, including various scenarios with different feature types under different levels of sample sizes. The missing data are generated based on different missing ratios and three kinds of missing mechanisms: missing completely at random (MCAR), missing at random (MAR), and missing not at random (MNAR). Our experiments show that, for small or moderate sample sizes, the conventional methods establish better robustness and imputation performance than the deep learning methods. GAINs only perform well in the case of MCAR and often fail in the cases of MAR and MNAR. VAEs are easy to fall into mode collapse in all missing mechanisms. We conclude that the conventional methods, MICE and missForest, are preferable for practitioners to deal with missing data imputation for tabular data with a limited sample size (i.e., n < 30, 000) in real case analyses.

AB Exploring the formation of valuable chemical feedstocks from renewable sources is critical for decreasing global dependence on fossil fuels. The decomposition of ethanol forms acetaldehyde, a solvent and precursor for dyes, pesticides, pharmaceuticals and more; ethylene, which is crucial for the plastics industry; and clean hydrogen, a necessity for all hydrogenation reactions. While it is well known that Cu(111) and oxidized Cu(111) catalyze the dehydrogenation of small primary alcohols to form aldehydes, dehydration products to form alkenes are less discussed. An in depth study of the reactivity of ethanol on O/Cu(111) shows dehydrogenation, dehydration, and combustion products using temperature programmed reaction spectroscopy (TPRS). The presence of oxygen on O/Cu(111) resulted predominantly in acetaldehyde formation via the dehydrogenation pathway, with lesser amounts of ethylene via dehydration, as well as combustion products. Successive TPRS experiments resulted in decreased yields of all products due to the consumption of surface oxygen via water formation <200 K. Isotopic studies of ethanol-OD indicate the role of the hydroxyl hydrogen in water formation from O-ads compared to water that desorbs during dehydration, as well as hydrogen formation via the dehydrogenation pathway. The dehydration pathway is proposed to occur via autocatalytic production of O-ads during the ethoxy transformation to ethylene, furthering the reaction to form ethylene and CO2.

TI Elucidating early proton irradiation effects in metal halide perovskites

SO ISCIENCE

ID SOLAR-CELLS; TOLERANCE
AB Metal halide perovskite (MHP) solar cells are promising aerospace power sources given their potential as inexpensive, lightweight, and resilient solar electricity generators. Herein, the intrinsic radiation tolerance of unencapsulated methylammonium lead iodide/chloride (CH3NH3PbI3-xClx) films was isolated. Spatially resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and confocal microscopy revealed the fundamental defect physics through optical changes as films were irradiated with 4.5 MeV neutrons and 20 keV protons at fluences between 531010 and 131016 p+/cm2. As proton radiation increased beyond 131013 p+/cm2, defects formed in the film, causing both a decrease in photoluminescence intensity and a 30% increase in surface darkening. All proton irradiated films additionally exhibited continuous increase of energy bandgaps and decreasing charge recombination lifetimes with increasing proton fluences. These optical changes in the absorber layer precede performance declines detectable in standard current-voltage measurements of complete solar cell devices and therefore have the potential of serving as early indicators of radiation tolerance.

AB During the COVID-19 pandemic, most, if not all, animal rescues, sanctuaries, zoos, and aquariums experienced financial distress. This stress had an impact on the welfare of animals and their human caretakers, an issue important to ecological social work. We draw on a novel dataset (n = 2,060) to assess support for policies to extend emergency funding to animal support and conservation organizations in extreme events. We find that, on average women and nonbinary individuals, those with more education, people who have pets, people who are concerned about other humans (humanistic altruism), and those who have greater concern for animals report greater support.

ID ULTRATHIN; MECHANISM; BAND
AB Internal photoemission or hot-electron injection (HEJ) occurring at the metalsemiconductor (MS) Schottky interface has shown great promise in sub-bandgap photodetection and photovoltaics. In this paper, we put forward a plasmonic metagrating-interlayer-semiconductor (PMIS) structure that can significantly enhance the photon-to-electron conversion efficiency of HEJ-based optoelectronic devices. Thanks to the effect of image force-induced barrier lowering, a metal-interlayer-semiconductor (MIS) heterojunction with an ultrathin 2D material interlayer can considerably facilitate the hot electron transport across the Schottky barrier, resulting in a high internal quantum efficiency (IQE). Meanwhile, nanopatterning the MIS heterojunction into the plasmonic metagrating enables high optical absorption such that the device's external quantum efficiency (EQE) can be nearly equal to its IQE. In addition, this device can be wavelengthand polarization-selective by tailoring the geometry and dimensions of plasmonic metagrating, thereby paving a promising path toward bandgap-independent photodetection, energy harvesting, and photocatalysis.

AB Cationic gold-alkyne chemistry is a vital component of homogeneous gold catalysis due to its ability to access a wide range of reactive intermediates. Direct C(sp(3))-H insertion by the cationic gold-alkyne complex is an emergent reaction in this area without a well-defined reactive intermediate. Gold(I)-catalyzed isomerization of cyclooctyne facilitated by trans-annular C(sp(3))-H insertion () is used as a case study to investigate the mechanism of this process with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Natural resonance theory (NRT) calculations are used to analyze the reactive intermediate in terms of familiar resonance structures. It is found that "slippage" or deformation of the gold ion coordination from eta 2 to eta 1 increases the NRT weighting of the vinyl cation resonance structure from 12% to 25% leading to its C(sp(3))-H insertion reactivity. In addition, DFT calculations and a distortion-interaction analysis are used to rationalize the catalyst-dependent regioselectivity observed in the reaction. Lastly, model studies investigating the impact of the alkyne substrate and ancillary ligand show that electron-withdrawing substituents and electron deficient ligands lower Gibbs activation energy for C(sp(3))-H insertion, which suggests strategies to further improve the reaction through catalyst design.

AB We use coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to study deformation of networks and gels of linear and brush strands in both linear and nonlinear deformation regimes under constant pressure conditions. The simulations show that the Poisson ratio of networks and gels could exceed 0.5 in the nonlinear deformation regime. This behavior is due to the ability of the network and gel strands to sustain large reversible deformation, which, in combination with the finite strand extensibility results in strand alignment and monomer density, increases with increasing strand elongation. We developed a nonlinear network and gel deformation model which defines conditions for the Poisson ratio to exceed 0.5. The model predictions are in good agreement with the simulation results.

AB Networking research has witnessed a renaissance from exploring the seemingly unlimited predictive power of machine learning (ML) models. One such promising direction is throughput prediction - accurately predicting the network bandwidth or achievable throughput of a client in real time using ML models can enable a wide variety of network applications to proactively adapt their behavior to the changing network dynamics to potentially achieve significantly improved QoE. Motivated by the key role of newer generations of cellular networks in supporting the new generation of latency-critical applications such as AR/MR, in this work, we focus on accurate throughput prediction in cellular networks at fine time-scales, e.g., in the order of 100 ms. Through a 4-day, 1000+ km driving trip, we collect a dataset of fine-grained throughput measurements under driving across all three major US operators. Using the collected dataset, we conduct the first feasibility study of predicting fine-grained application throughput in real-world cellular networks with mixed LTE/5G technologies. Our analysis shows that popular ML models previously claimed to predict well for various wireless networks scenarios (e.g., WiFi or single-technology network such as LTE only) do not predict well under app-centric metrics such as ARE95 and PARE10. Further, we uncover the root cause for the poor prediction accuracy of ML models as the inherent conflicting sample sequences in the fine-grained cellular network throughput data.

AB Additive manufacturing (AM), also known as 3D printing, has significantly advanced in recent years, especially with the introduction of multifunctional 3D-printed parts. AM fabricated monolith has multiple material capabilities, thus various functionalities are well-perceived by the manufacturing communities. As an example, a traditional fused filament fabrication (FFF) 3D printer fabricates multi-material thermoplastic parts using a dual extrusion system to increase the functionality of the part including variable stiffening and gradient structures. In addition to the multiple thermoplastic feedstocks in a dual extrusion system, multifunctional AM can be achieved by embedding electronics or reinforcing fibers within the fabricated thermoplastic parts, which significantly impacts the rapid prototyping of hybrid components in manufacturing industries. State-of-the-art techniques such as coextrusion systems, ultrasonic welding tools, and thermal embedding tools have been implemented to automate the process of embedding conductive material within the 3D-printed thermoplastic substrate. The goal of this tool development effort is to embed wires within 3D 3D-printed plastic substrate.
   This research consisted of developing a wire embedding tool that can be integrated into an FFF desktop 3D printer to deposit conductive as well as resistive wires within the 3D-printed thermoplastic substrate. By realizing the challenges for discrete materials interaction at the interface such as nichrome wires and Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) plastics and polylactic acid (PLA), the goal of this tool was to immerse wire within ABS and PLA substrate using transient swelling mechanisms under non-polar solvent.
   A proof-of-concept test stands with a wire feed system and the embedding wheel was first designed and manufactured using 3D printing to examine if a traditional roller-guided system, primarily used for plastic extrusion, would be sufficient for wire extrusion. The development of the integrated wire embedding tool was initiated based on the success of the proof-of-concept wire extrusion system. The design of the integrated wire embedding tool consisted of three sub-assemblies: wire delivery assembly, wire shearing assembly, and swivel assembly. The wire delivery assembly is responsible for feeding the wire towards the thermoplastic using the filament delivery system seen within FFF printers. For the wire shearing mechanism, a cutting Tungsten carbide blade in conjunction with a Nema-17 external stepper motor was used to shear the wire. For the wire embedding assembly, a custom swivel mount was fabricated with a bearing housing for a ball bearing that allowed for a 360-degree motion around the horizontal plane. A wire guide nozzle was placed through the mount to allow for the wire to be fed down into a brass embedding wheel in a tangential manner. Additionally, the solvent reservoir was mounted such that an even layer of solution was dispensed onto the thermoplastic substrate. Through this tool development effort, the aim was to develop technologies that will enable 3D printing of wire-embedded monolith for various applications including a self-heating mold of thermoset-based composite manufacturing as well as smart composites with embedded sensors.

AB Recent years have witnessed rapid advances in the use of neural networks to solve combinatorial optimization problems. Nevertheless, designing the "right" neural model that can effectively handle a given optimization problem can be challenging, and often there is no theoretical understanding or justification of the resulting neural model. In this paper, we focus on the rectilinear Steiner minimum tree (RSMT) problem, which is of critical importance in IC layout design and as a result has attracted numerous heuristic approaches in the VLSI literature. Our contributions are two-fold. On the methodology front, we propose NN-Steiner, which is a novel mixed neural-algorithmic framework for computing RSMTs that leverages the celebrated PTAS algorithmic framework of Arora to solve this problem (and other geometric optimization problems). Our NN-Steiner replaces key algorithmic components within Arora's PTAS by suitable neural components. In particular, NN-Steiner only needs four neural network (NN) components that are called repeatedly within an algorithmic framework. Crucially, each of the four NN components is only of bounded size independent of input size, and thus easy to train. Furthermore, as the NN component is learning a generic algorithmic step, once learned, the resulting mixed neural-algorithmic framework generalizes to much larger instances not seen in training. Our NN-Steiner, to our best knowledge, is the first neural architecture of bounded size that has capacity to approximately solve RSMT (and variants). On the empirical front, we show how NN-Steiner can be implemented and demonstrate the effectiveness of our resulting approach, especially in terms of generalization, by comparing with state-of-the-art methods (both neural and non-neural based).

AB As quantum computing continues to advance, it poses unprecedented risks to traditional factor-based encryption methods, such as RSA, undermining the security of current cryptographic protocols. To address this pivotal security concern, this paper explores a quantum-safe solution that includes two cutting-edge Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) systems, two integrated encryptors, and various networking devices to establish a fortified framework for secure communication. We introduce a system environment setup encompassing the initial configuration, software updates, and management using CM7 software. Next, we delve into the essential configuration and integration steps for deploying a quantum-safe communication network. Moreover, we highlight the strategic implementation of automated script deployment processes, which are instrumental in configuring the QKD system and encryptors. Furthermore, we perform a performance evaluation of the quantum-safe network system, which provides valuable insights into the system's resilience through experimental simulations of beam-splitting attacks. This study provides crucial insights into operational dynamics and showcases the effectiveness of securing communications against cyber threats, underlining the significant potential of quantum-safe solutions in fortifying network security.

AB The rising threat of antibiotic resistance in pathogenic bacteria emphasizes the need for new therapeutic strategies. This review focuses on bacterial transcription factors (TFs), which play crucial roles in bacterial pathogenesis. We discuss the regulatory roles of these factors through examples, and we outline potential therapeutic strategies targeting bacterial TFs. Specifically, we discuss the use of small molecules to interfere with TF function and the development of transcription factor decoys, oligonucleotides that compete with promoters for TF binding. We also cover peptides that target the interaction between the bacterial TF and other factors, such as RNA polymerase, and the targeting of sigma factors. These strategies, while promising, come with challenges, from identifying targets to designing interventions, managing side effects, and accounting for changing bacterial resistance patterns. We also delve into how Artificial Intelligence contributes to these efforts and how it may be exploited in the future, and we touch on the roles of multidisciplinary collaboration and policy to advance this research domain.Abbreviations: AI, artificial intelligence; CNN, convolutional neural networks; DTI: drug-target interaction; HTH, helix-turn-helix; IHF, integration host factor; LTTRs, LysR-type transcriptional regulators; MarR, multiple antibiotic resistance regulator; MRSA, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus; MSA: multiple sequence alignment; NAP, nucleoid-associated protein; PROTACs, proteolysis targeting chimeras; RNAP, RNA polymerase; TF, transcription factor; TFD, transcription factor decoying; TFTRs, TetR-family transcriptional regulators; wHTH, winged helix-turn-helix.

AB We argue that the dual-system approach and, particularly, the default-interventionist framework favored by De Neys unnecessarily constrains process models, limiting their range of application. In turn, the accommodations De Neys makes for these constraints raise questions of parsimony and falsifiability. We conclude that the extent to which processes possess features of system 1 versus system 2 must be tested empirically.

AB Aziridinesare commonly used as reagents for the synthesisof drugsubstances although they are potentially mutagenic and genotoxic.Therefore, their unambiguous detection is critically important. Unfortunately,tandem mass spectrometry (MS2) based on collision-activateddissociation (CAD), a powerful method used for the identificationof many unknown compounds in complex mixtures, does not provide diagnosticfragmentation patterns for ionized aziridines. Therefore, a differentmass spectrometry approach based on MS3 experiments ispresented here for the identification of the aziridine functionalities.This approach is based on selective gas-phase ion-molecule reactionsof protonated analytes with tris(dimethylamino)borane (TDMAB) followedby diagnostic CAD reactions in a modified linear quadrupole ion trap(LQIT) mass spectrometer. TDMAB reacts with protonated aziridinesby forming adduct ions that have lost a dimethylamine (DMA) molecule([M + H + TDMAB - HN(CH3)(2)](+)). CAD on these product ions generated diagnostic fragment ions with m/z-values 25- and 43-units lower than those of the ion-moleculereaction product ions. None of the ion-molecule reaction product ionsformed from other, structurally related, protonated analytes producedrelated fragment ions. Quantum chemical calculations were employedto explore the mechanisms of the observed reactions.

AB Virtual reality (VR) technologies are used in a diverse range of applications. Many of these involve an embodied conversational agent (ECA), a virtual human who exchanges information with the user. Unfortunately, VR technologies remain inaccessible to many users due to the phenomenon of cybersickness: a collection of negative symptoms such as nausea and headache that can appear when immersed in a simulation. Many factors are believed to affect a user's level of cybersickness, but little is known regarding how these factors may influence a user's opinion of an ECA. In this study, we examined the effects of virtual stairs, a factor associated with increased levels of cybersickness. We recruited 39 participants to complete a simulated airport experience. This involved a simple navigation task followed by a brief conversation with a virtual airport customs agent in Spanish. Participants completed the experience twice, once walking across flat hallways, and once traversing a series of staircases. We collected self-reported ratings of cybersickness, presence, and perception of the ECA. We additionally collected physiological data on heart rate and galvanic skin response. Results indicate that the virtual staircases increased user level's of cybersickness and reduced their perceived realism of the ECA, but increased levels of presence.

AB There has been an increased interest in the integration of pre-trained speech recognition (ASR) and language models (LM) into the SLU framework. However, prior methods often struggle with a vocabulary mismatch between pretrained models, and LM cannot be directly utilized as they diverge from its NLU formulation. In this study, we propose a three-pass end-toend (E2E) SLU system that effectively integrates ASR and LM subnetworks into the SLU formulation for sequence generation tasks. In the first pass, our architecture predicts ASR transcripts using the ASR subnetwork. This is followed by the LM subnetwork, which makes an initial SLU prediction. Finally, in the third pass, the deliberation subnetwork conditions on representations from the ASR and LM subnetworks to make the final prediction. Our proposed three-pass SLU system shows improved performance over cascaded and E2E SLU models on two benchmark SLU datasets, SLURP and SLUE, especially on acoustically challenging utterances.

AB The safety and security of educational environments are paramount concerns for communities worldwide. Recent incidents of violence in schools underscore the urgent need for innovative and proactive safety measures that extend beyond traditional reactive approaches. In response to this imperative, we propose an Advanced Federated Learning-Empowered Edge-Cloud Framework for School Safety Prediction and Emergency Alert System, which is a groundbreaking solution designed to address the pressing challenges of ensuring school safety. In a world where educational institutions face escalating threats, this framework leverages the innovative approach of federated learning, enabling real-time threat detection and proactive alert generation while preserving data privacy. Challenges such as delayed response times, false alarms, and limited threat assessment protocols are met head-on through the integration of predictive algorithms, sensors, and edge computing. This transformative system not only revolutionizes security but also prioritizes the psychological well-being of students, staff, and visitors, fostering an environment conducive to learning. Its significance lies in its potential to prevent incidents, minimize harm, and bolster community confidence in school safety measures, ultimately contributing to the wellbeing and growth of future generations. Through this pioneering work, we aim to redefine school safety paradigms, making educational institutions safer and more secure for all.

ID WORKLOAD
AB Systematic reviews (SRs) are a crucial component of evidence-based clinical practice. Unfortunately, SRs are labor-intensive and unscalable with the exponential growth in literature. Automating evidence synthesis using machine learning models has been proposed but solely focuses on the text and ignores additional features like citation information. Recent work demonstrated that citation embeddings can outperform the text itself, suggesting that better network representation may expedite SRs. Yet, how to utilize the rich information in heterogeneous information networks (HIN) for network embeddings is understudied. Existing HIN models fail to produce a high-quality embedding compared to simply running state-of-the-art homogeneous network models. To address existing HIN model limitations, we propose SR-CoMbEr, a community-based multi-view graph convolutional network for learning better embeddings for evidence synthesis. Our model automatically discovers article communities to learn robust embeddings that simultaneously encapsulate the rich semantics in HINs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model to automate 15 SRs.

AB The timing of motor commands is critical for task performance. A well-known example is rapidly raising the arm while standing upright. Here, reaction forces from the arm movement to the body are countered by leg and trunk muscle activity starting before any sensory feedback from the perturbation and often before the onset of arm muscle activity. Despite decades of research on the patterns, modifiability, and neural basis of these "anticipatory postural adjustments," it remains unclear why asynchronous motor commands occur. Simple accuracy considerations appear unlikely since temporally advanced motor commands displace the body from its initial position. Effort is a credible and overlooked factor that has successfully explained coordination patterns of many behaviors including gait and reaching. We provide the first use of optimal control to address this question. Feedforward commands were applied to a body mass mechanically linked to a rapidly moving limb mass. We determined the feedforward actions with the lowest cost according to an explicit criterion, accuracy alone versus accuracy thorn effort. Accuracy costs alone led to synchronous activation of the body and limb controllers. Adding effort to the cost resulted in body commands preceding limb commands. This sequence takes advantage of the body's momentum in one direction to counter the limb's reaction force in the opposite direction, allowing a lower peak command and lower integral. With a combined accuracy thorn effort cost, temporal advancement was further impacted by various task goals and plant dynamics, replicating previous findings and suggesting further studies using optimal control principles.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY An important goal in the fields of sensorimotor neuroscience and biomechanics is to explain the timing of different muscles during behavior. Here, we propose that energy and accuracy considerations underlie the asynchronous onset of postural and arm muscles during rapid movement. Our novel model-based framework replicates a broad range of observations across varying task demands and plant dynamics and offers a new perspective to study motor timing.

AB Mixture models are widely used to fit complex and multimodal datasets. In this paper we study mixtures with high dimensional sparse parameter vectors and consider the problem of support recovery of those vectors. While parameter learning in mixture models is well-studied, the sparsity constraint remains relatively unexplored. Sparsity of parameter vectors is a natural assumption in high dimensional settings, and support recovery is a major step towards parameter estimation. We provide efficient algorithms for support recovery that have a logarithmic sample complexity dependence on the dimensionality of the latent space, and also poly-logarithmic dependence on sparsity. Our algorithms, applicable to mixtures of many different canonical distributions including high dimensional Uniform, Poisson, Laplace, Gaussians, etc., are based on the method of moments. In most of these settings, our results are the first guarantees on the problem while in the rest, our results provide improvements on or are competitive with existing works.

AB We report the first demonstration of displays driven by embedded transistors that were additively manufactured entirely by aerosol jet printing. The backplanes of the liquid crystal displays (LCDs) consist of transistors printed from graphene, carbon nanotubes, and crystalline nanocellulose onto a glass substrate with prepatterned indium tin oxide electrodes. We addressed challenges of integrating fully printed devices into both the crossbar array structure and layered vertical structure required for an LCD, showing successful pixel switching at up to 60 Hz. As these thin-film transistors are printed exclusively from carbon-based recyclable materials, without high temperatures or vacuum processing, they offer a promising means for reducing waste in future display technologies.

AB Engineered living materials (ELMs) are an emerging class of materials with the potential for transformative impacts in sustainability across sectors (e.g., water, energy, health). Progress toward producing ELMs with tailorable and/or stimuli-responsive functionalities has occurred in recent years, along with advances in materials manufacturing with increased complexity and scale. While a few ELMs have been commercialized, important barriers must be surmounted before their broader integration into society. These social, ethical, legal, and regulatory barriers, as well as barriers to collaboration between stakeholders, were identified in a workshop combining academic, industry, and government agency participants that was convened as part of the annual Montana Biofilm Meeting (Bozeman, MT) in July 2023. The ELM research community finds itself at a defining moment. Urgent action is needed to realize the societal benefits of ELMs while decreasing the likelihood of negative perception, and actual consequences, of their commercialization.

AB Transfer stigma refers to a type of stigma associated with students' transfer status and/or their community college background. It plays a significant role in post-transfer adjustment and may negatively impact post-transfer outcomes such as retention and obtaining a baccalaureate degree. This study focused on quantitatively measuring transfer stigma among transfer students attending a four-year institution. Drawing from previous studies, we developed a 13-item transfer stigma measure and included it in a transfer student survey. The survey data was collected from 450 current transfer students at a public, flagship four-year university in Louisiana. Through an exploratory factor analysis and a confirmatory factor analysis, we revealed a four-factor structure of transfer stigma measures: internalized self-stigma, perceptions about community colleges, lack of support, and perceived judgment. Subsequent statistical analyses examined group differences in the degree of transfer stigma across various transfer student subgroups defined by transfer type, gender, race/ethnicity, age, and major.

AB Researchers have used eye-tracking measures to explore the relationship between face encoding and recognition, including the impact of ethnicity on this relationship. Previous studies offer a variety of conflicting conclusions. This confusion may stem from misestimation of the relationship between encoding and recognition. First, most previous models fail to account for the structure of eye-tracking data, potentially falling prey to Simpson's paradox. Second, previous models assume a linear relationship between attention (e.g., the number of fixations to a to-be-remembered face) and recognition accuracy. Two eye-tracking studies (Ns = 41, 59), one online experiment that manipulates exposure (N = 150), and a mega-analysis examine the effects of ethnicity using what we believe to be more appropriate analytical models. Across studies and measures, we document a novel, critical pattern: The relationship between attention and recognition is nonlinear and negatively accelerating. At low levels of baseline attention, a small increment in attention improves recognition. However, as attention increases further, increments yield smaller and smaller benefits. This finding parallels work in learning and memory. In models that allow for nonlinearity, we find evidence that central features (eyes, nose, and mouth) generally contribute to recognition accuracy, potentially resolving disagreements in the field. We also find that the effects of attention on recognition are similar for ingroup and outgroup faces, which have important implications for theories of perceptual expertise.

AB Control barrier functions-based quadratic programming (CBF-QP) is gaining popularity as an effective controller synthesis tool for safe control. However, the provable safety is established on an accurate dynamic model and access to all states. To address such a limitation, this paper proposes a novel design combining an extended state observer (ESO) with a CBF for safe control of a system with model uncertainty and external disturbances only using output measurement. Our approach provides a less conservative estimation error bound than other disturbance observer-based CBFs. Moreover, only output measurements are needed to estimate the disturbances instead of access to the full state. The bounds of state estimation error and disturbance estimation error are obtained in a unified manner and then used for robust safe control under uncertainty. We validate our approach's efficacy in simulations of an adaptive cruise control system and a Segway self-balancing scooter.

AB In modern multi-/many-core HPC systems, the increasing number of processor cores presents new challenges in managing parallel compute workloads across multiple nodes. One crucial aspect that significantly impacts the startup phase of parallel MPI jobs is the methodology used for connection establishment. In this paper, we investigate the limitations of existing all-to-all connection establishment designs in-depth, identify the primary sources of performance overhead, and propose an optimized all-to-all connection establishment design. This is done through an enforced ordering rank-by-rank scheme that significantly cuts down on the data exchange overhead via PMI. To address the increasing overheads associated with queue pair creation and synchronization, we explore multi-thread parallelism and incorporate CPU affinity awareness into our design. We implement our proposed design in the state-of-the-art MVAPICH2 MPI library and conduct extensive experiments on two emerging architectures. Through a comprehensive performance evaluation of these architectures, we demonstrate the efficacy of our optimized all-to-all connection establishment design. Our microbenchmark results reveal up to 20 times faster MPI Init time, while evaluations with application kernels exhibit a 31% improvement in throughput.

AB With the proliferation of smart devices and widespread Internet connectivity, social sensing is advancing as a pervasive sensing paradigm where experiences shared by individuals on social platforms (e.g., Twitter and Facebook) are analyzed to interpret the physical world. In this article, we introduce CovidTrak, a vision of social intelligence-empowered contact tracing that aims to scrutinize the knowledge derived using social sensing to track Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections among the general public. Contact tracing is known to be an effective technique for detecting and monitoring persons who may have been exposed to individuals infected with any communicable disease. While a good number of contact tracing schemes are existent today (e.g., in-person and phone interviews, paper forms, email and web-based questionnaires, and smartphone apps), they often require active user participation and might miss certain cases of social interactions that go off-the-records but still lead to COVID-19 transmission. By contrast, social sensing provides an alternative avenue for spontaneously determining such contacts by harnessing the rich experiences and information conveyed by people on social data platforms (e.g., a group photograph tweeted from a house party with a potential contact). As such, CovidTrak can form a powerful basis to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The vision of CovidTrak intends to answer the following questions: 1) how to bolster the privacy and security of the online users while determining their contacts? 2) how to collect relevant social signals that indicate in-person encounters among people? 3) how to reliably process the vast amount of noisy data from social platforms to identify chains of transmission? 4) how to handle the scarcity of location metadata in the incoming data? 5) how to effectively communicate crucial contact information to concerned individuals? and 6) how to model and handle the responses of the common people toward contact information? We envision unexplored opportunities to leverage multidisciplinary techniques to address the above questions and develop effective future CovidTrak schemes.

AB A robust system should perform well under random failures or targeted attacks, and networks have been widely used to model the underlying structure of complex systems such as communication, infrastructure, and transportation networks. Hence, network robustness becomes critical to understanding system robustness. In this paper, we propose a spectral measure for network robustness: the second spectral moment m(2) of the network. Our results show that a smaller second spectral moment m(2) indicates a more robust network. We demonstrate both theoretically and with extensive empirical studies that the second spectral moment can help (1) capture various traditional measures of network robustness; (2) assess the robustness of networks; (3) design networks with controlled robustness; and (4) study how complex networked systems (e.g., power systems) behave under cascading failures.

AB While sequential recommender systems achieve significant improvements on capturing user dynamics, we argue that sequential recommenders are vulnerable against substitution-based profile pollution attacks. To demonstrate our hypothesis, we propose a substitution-based adversarial attack algorithm, which modifies the input sequence by selecting certain vulnerable elements and substituting them with adversarial items. In both untargeted and targeted attack scenarios, we observe significant performance deterioration using the proposed profile pollution algorithm. Motivated by such observations, we design an efficient adversarial defense method called Dirichlet neighborhood sampling. Specifically, we sample item embeddings from a convex hull constructed by multi-hop neighbors to replace the original items in input sequences. During sampling, a Dirichlet distribution is used to approximate the probability distribution in the neighborhood such that the recommender learns to combat local perturbations. Additionally, we design an adversarial training method tailored for sequential recommender systems. In particular, we represent selected items with one-hot encodings and perform gradient ascent on the encodings to search for the worst case linear combination of item embeddings in training. As such, the embedding function learns robust item representations and the trained recommender is resistant to test-time adversarial examples. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of both our attack and defense methods, which consistently outperform baselines by a significant margin across model architectures and datasets.

AB Anticipating changes in social norms presents a significant challenge for social scientists. Historical instances when researchers failed to predict dramatic shifts in collective behavior, along with the persistence of norms that impede welfare, underscore the need for a deeper understanding of how norms evolve. This article reviews current advancements in predicting norm change using threshold models. We document the rise of empirical studies, emphasize recent methodological developments, and discuss open questions for future research.

AB Community college STEM students often aspire to transfer to baccalaureate institutions to pursue careers requiring advanced degrees. To support their efforts, community colleges offer programming and support to aid degree attainment and transfer. While their community college experiences are critical to understanding the whole of STEM education research, few studies attend to these experiences and those that do often focus on curricula and teaching. This study contributes to the community college experience literature by evaluating Lunch & Learn - one component of a community college STEM Scholars program that was designed around model of student retention. The goal is to understand how Lunch & Learn supports transfer-intending STEM students. This longitudinal qualitative study uses iterative thematic analysis of observational data and an interview with the program's director to determine the most salient practices critical to persistence and retention. Findings indicate that this program supported social and academic integration by (a) sustaining a supportive social community, (b) providing opportunities to access and capitalize on information networks, and (c) building STEM student self-efficacy and identity. This work can inform the design of others' spaces within the community college structures that support the work done inside the classroom and how these programs are contributing to the successful transfer of STEM students.

AB Gamified simulations, integrating gameplay into education, cater to younger learners' digital preferences and align with Next Generation Science Standards. Current virtual modules focus on advanced high school classes, leaving a gap for middle school students. This study investigated the impact of substituting recitations in a 6th-grade ecology class with Feed the Dingo, a gamified module. Through quizzes evaluating academic performance and free-response surveys to gauge students' attitudes, the module appeared to enhance intuitive understanding of core ecological concepts (e.g., ecosystems, food webs, biodiversity, etc.), resulting in commendable academic achievement and positive feedback. Such simulations serve as valuable supplements for K-12 lesson planning.

AB In this paper, we consider the linear stability of ion-irradiated thin films where the typical no-penetration boundary condition has been relaxed to a phase-change or mass conservation boundary condition. This results in the modification of the bulk velocity field by the density jump across the amorphous-crystalline interface as new material enters the film and instantaneously changes volume. In other physical systems, phase change at a moving boundary is known to affect linear stability, but such an effect has not yet been considered in the context of continuum models of ion-induced nanopatterning. We also determine simple closed-form expressions for the amorphous-crystalline interface in terms of the free interface, appealing directly to the physics of the collision cascade, which was recently shown to strongly modify the critical angle at which pattern formation is predicted to begin on an irradiated target. We find that phase-change at the amorphous-crystalline boundary imparts a strong ion, target, and energy dependence and, alongside a precise description of the interfacial geometry, may contribute to a unified, predictive, and continuum-type model of ion-induced nanopatterning valid across a wide range of systems. In particular, we consider argon-irradiated silicon, where the presence of phase-change at the amorphous-crystalline interface appears to predict an experimentally observed, strong suppression of pattern formation near 1.5 keV for that system.

AB Herein we report the preparation of high sulfur-content materials (HSMs) using food waste and elemental sulfur. Peanut hulls and peanut oil were combined with sulfur to yield HxOyS90 (x = wt% peanut hulls, y = wt% peanut oil) to enable systematic investigation of the relationship between unsaturated oil content and HSM properties. Next, post-consumer food wastes cooked in peanut oil, specifically fresh as well as desiccated French fries, were combined with elemental sulfur to afford WFFS90 and DFFS90, respectively. Differential scanning calorimetry revealed all HSMs in this study were readily remeltable and provided evidence for the presence of oligo/polysulfide chains crosslinking the food waste-derived organic matter. Impressively, the compressive strengths of HxOyS90, WFFS90, and DFFS90 were comparable or superior to that of ordinary Portland cement. Quantitative assessment of the HSMs described in this study using the environmental metrics of atom economy, E-factor, and global warming potential (GWP) yielded values ranging from 93.5% to 100% for atom economy, 0 to 0.07 for E-factor, and -0.574 to +0.608 kg CO2 eq. per kg for GWP. Moreover, the syntheses of these HSMs achieved 8 of the 12 Principles of Green Chemistry and 5 of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals. Collectively, the findings reported in this work provide strong evidence that HxOyS90, WFFS90, and DFFS90 will function as thermally-recyclable, mechanically-robust sustainable alternatives to concretes.
   Herein we report the preparation of high sulfur-content materials (HSMs) using food waste and elemental sulfur.

AB In physics classrooms, like in society writ large, power is embedded in space-both material space and actors' conceptions of space. In this paper, we explore space and power through the lens of "helping." Using our analysis of a classroom video clip and excerpts from stimulated recall interviews, we offer a case where "helping" mediates spatiality, reifying a hierarchy where some students are positioned as "knowing more" or "doing better" and others are thought of as "knowing less" or "not 'doing it' right." We connect this dynamic to age-old narratives of "helping" that are embedded in white supremacy to critically examine ways "helping" can be oppressive. Analyses like this open up possibilities for re-imagining physics classroom spaces, toward more just and equitable physics teaching and learning.

AB With the rising demand for computing power in High-Performance Computing and Deep Learning applications, there is a noticeable trend in outfitting modern exascale clusters with accelerators. In recent years, Intel has been designing and developing GPU products and their associated ecosystems. Concurrently, application developers are transitioning their programs to Intel GPUs, seeking to maximize the computational capabilities of multi-GPU systems by utilizing efficient communication facilitated by modern GPUaware MPI libraries. Hence, it is critical to design an efficient MPI collective library specifically tailored for Intel GPUs to optimize communication performance. In this paper, we proposed hybrid and IPC-based designs for data movement collective MPI operations on contemporary Intel GPU systems. For large message communication, we developed a comprehensive design for data movement collectives that surpasses reliance on basic send/recv pairs, effectively minimizing overheads. For small messages, we employ CPU staging techniques and compare various underlying libraries to ensure optimal performance. We evaluate the benefits of our designs at both the benchmark and application layers on the Intel DevCloud, utilizing 4 Intel GPUs connected with X-e. Links. In benchmark-level evaluations, our Alltoall and Allgather implementations show a constant 100 mu s improvement for large messages, while other operations like Bcast achieve a 72x performance enhancement compared to MPICH at 32MB. In application-level evaluations, our proposed designs demonstrate up to a 30% improvement for the HPC application heFFTe compared to the second-best solution using MPICH.

AB A fresh perspective on analyzing the quality of perishable goods has emerged within the world of digital twins in mixed reality. Traditionally, assessing the safety of agricultural products has heavily relied on two-dimensional images, which often fall short of capturing the intricate details effectively. In contrast, the adoption of three-dimensional models offers a more comprehensive and intricate representation of these short-lived food items. These digitally reconstructed pairs provide a strong foundation for an advanced analysis of the freshness and storage conditions of food products, leading to an improved grasp of their overall quality. Also, the research explores the practicality of transporting these newly designed 3D models into an environment of mixed reality, with a specific focus on the Microsoft HoloLens 2 platform. This involves incorporating the ability to analyze bruising in this mixed reality space. This merging introduces a complete, immersive, and interactive avenue for visualizing these reconstructed objects, ultimately creating new pathways for inventive and novel methods to comprehensively explore and analyze the subject matter.

AB Toolkits are an important means of sharing expertise and influencing practice. However, the work of making and sustaining toolkits is not well understood. We address this gap by conducting 20 semi-structured interviews with toolkit designers, focusing on toolkits intended to help practitioners such as librarians, teachers, and community workers. We analyze these interviews to surface key aspects of participants' design journeys: (1) how their projects began; (2) how they conceptualized use; (3) how they collaborated with users; (4) and what happened once their toolkit was released. We illustrate these aspects through three narratives, and discuss our findings to provide considerations for designers and scholars. We highlight how designers co-construct communities alongside their toolkits, helping us form a more nuanced understanding of the social aspects underpinning toolkit projects. Collectively, these contributions can help us identify challenges and opportunities in this design space, laying the groundwork to increase toolkits' social impact.

AB Thisstudy introduces a new approach for constructing atomisticmodels of nanoporous carbon by randomly distributing carbon atomsand pore volumes in a periodic box and then using empirical and ab initio molecular simulation tools to find the suitableenergy-minimum structures. The models, consisting of 5000, 8000, 12000,and 64000 atoms, each at mass densities of 0.5, 0.75, and 1 g/cm(3), were analyzed to determine their structural characteristicsand relaxed pore size distribution. Surface analysis of the pore regionrevealed that sp atoms exist predominantly on surfaces and act asactive sites for oxygen adsorption. We also investigated the electronicand vibrational properties of the models, and localized states nearthe Fermi level were found to be primarily situated at sp carbon atomsthrough which electrical conduction may occur. Additionally, the thermalconductivity was calculated using heat flux correlations and the Green-Kuboformula, and its dependence on pore geometry and connectivity wasanalyzed. The behavior of the mechanical elasticity moduli (Shear,Bulk, and Young's moduli) of nanoporous carbons at the densitiesof interest was discussed.

AB The physical mechanisms governing molecular mobility in liquids remain unresolved. Whether distinct mechanisms govern mobility in the Arrhenian and super-cooled regions, and whether the mobility in these regions can be unified remain open questions. Here, molecular dynamics simulations were used to search for a structural property with a temperature dependence related by a simple functional form to the temperature dependent translational diffusion coefficient, D-trans. The logarithm of D-trans was found to be a two-parameter function of F-2, where F-2 is the mean squared-force per molecule. The relationship is demonstrated for all systems investigated: a three-bead model of ortho-terphenyl, an 80:20 binary mixture of Lennard-Jones spheres, and a system of Lennard-Jones dumbbells. For each system, the relationship holds for the entire range of temperatures under both constant pressure and constant density conditions. The same F-2-based expression describes the translational diffusion coefficient in the Arrhenian, crossover, and super-Arrhenian regions.

AB Attempts to use machine learning to develop atmospheric parameterizations have mainly focused on subgrid effects on temperature and moisture, but subgrid momentum transport is also important in simulations of the atmospheric circulation. Here, we use neural networks to develop a subgrid momentum transport parameterization that learns from coarse-grained output of a high-resolution atmospheric simulation in an idealized aquaplanet domain. We show that substantial subgrid momentum transport occurs due to convection. The neural-network parameterization has skill in predicting momentum fluxes associated with convection, although its skill for subgrid momentum fluxes is lower compared to subgrid energy and moisture fluxes. The parameterization conserves momentum, and when implemented in the same atmospheric model at coarse resolution it leads to stable simulations and tends to reduce wind biases, although it over-corrects for one configuration tested. Overall, our results show that it is challenging to predict subgrid momentum fluxes and that machine-learning momentum parameterization gives promising results.

AB Parity-time-reciprocal scaling (PTX)-symmetry has been recently proposed to tailor the resonance linewidth and gain threshold of non-Hermitian systems with new exhilarating applications, such as coherent perfect absorber-laser (CPAL) and exceptional point (EP)-based devices. Here, we put forward a nearly-lossless, low-index metachannel formed by PTX- symmetric metasurfaces operating at the CPAL point, supporting the undamped weakly-guided fast wave (leaky mode) and thus achieving ultradirective leaky-wave radiation. Moreover, this structure allows for a reconfigurable and tunable radiation angle as well as beamwidth determined by the reciprocally scaled gain-loss parameter. We envision that the proposed PTX-symmetric metasurfaces will shed light on the design of antennas and emitters with ultrahigh directionality, as well as emerging applications enabled by extreme material properties, such as epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) and beyond.(c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI Bridging the Divide: Understanding Language Beliefs and Practices Among
   Caregivers in the Deep South to Inform Culturally Responsive

AB The 30 million word gap refers to the disparity in early language exposure between low socioeconomic status (SES) children and their higher SES peers, a gap that is thought to negatively impact children's language development and future academic success. Although many early intervention approaches have proven effective in promoting language development among low SES children, they often fall short in terms of cultural responsiveness, which in turn affects caregiver buy-in. The purpose of the current study was to characterize the language beliefs and practices of caregivers in a region of the Deep South in the U.S., Louisiana, which is a racially diverse state characterized by high rates of poverty, with the goal of informing more strength-based interventions that build on caregiver beliefs and practices. Eighty-three caregivers completed a survey examining their priorities for child development, beliefs and practices surrounding language development, and greatest perceived barriers in supporting their child. Language development and problem-solving skills were the most important aspects of child development across all caregivers. Beliefs about how language develops, which context caregivers most frequently engage with their children, and whom children talk to most differed across racial and SES groups. Despite interventions aimed at modifying low SES caregivers' language input, these caregivers did not perceive their own language abilities to be a challenge in supporting their child's language development. The findings from this study highlight differences in beliefs and practices regarding child development among caregivers from racially and socioeconomically diverse backgrounds, which may in turn differentially impact caregiver buy-in of early interventions.

AB In alignment with the Materials Genome Initiative and as the product of a workshop sponsored by the US National Science Foundation, we define a vision for materials laboratories of the future in alloys, amorphous materials, and composite materials; chart a roadmap for realizing this vision; identify technical bottlenecks and barriers to access; and propose pathways to equitable and democratic access to integrated toolsets in a manner that addresses urgent societal needs, accelerates technological innovation, and enhances manufacturing competitiveness. Spanning three important materials classes, this article summarizes the areas of alignment and unifying themes, distinctive needs of different materials research communities, key science drivers that cannot be accomplished within the capabilities of current materials laboratories, and open questions that need further community input. Here, we provide a broader context for the workshop, synopsize the salient findings, outline a shared vision for democratizing access and accelerating materials discovery, highlight some case studies across the three different materials classes, and identify significant issues that need further discussion.

AB Context effects occur when the preference between two alternatives is affected by the presence of an extra alternative. These effects are some of the most well studied phenomena in multi-alternative, multi-attribute decision making. Recent research in this area has revealed an intriguing pattern of results. On the one hand, these effects are robust and ubiquitous. That is, they have been demonstrated in many domains and different choice settings. On the other hand, they are fragile and they disappear or even reverse under different conditions. This pattern of results has spurred debate and speculation about the cognitive mechanisms that drive these choices. The attraction effect, where the preference for an option increases in the presence of a dominated decoy, has generated the most controversy. In this registered report, we systematically vary factors that are known to be associated with the attraction effect to build a solid foundation of empirical results to aid future theory development. We find a robust attraction effect across the different conditions. The strength of this effect is modulated by the display order (e.g., decoy top, target middle, competitor bottom) and mode (numeric vs. graphical) but not display layout (by-attribute vs. by-alternative).

AB Photoresists are thin film materials designed to transform an optimal image into a mechanical mask. Diverse exposure techniques such as photolithography induce modifications in the exposed areas that result in solubility changes that can then be selectively removed with appropriate agents (developers). Photoresist materials need to keep pace with the increasingly demand for feature size reduction. Typically, photoresist materials are organic polymers that can present small cross sections to the incoming photons, resulting in poor trade-off between resolution, sensitivity, or line-edge roughness. Photoresists also require a high etch-resistance relative to the substrate material, in order to preserve patterned features after the mechanical mask has been created. The main strategy to improve polymer performance during such processes is functionalization with different elements that can deliver higher efficiencies while keeping the chemical reactivity of the original polymer design. Here we consider a photoresist polymer structure model with general characteristics and investigate the functionalization of the polymer surface using density-functional theory (DFT), with a focus on reactive halogen adsorption. Physical and chemical surface reactions and the corresponding byproducts are identified, obtaining self-limitation thresholds for each specific functionalizing agent. Moreover, spectral signals of the modified polymer surfaces are analyzed in detail, to allow experimental validation of the proposed surface modifications. Finally, using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) and real time time-dependent DFT (rt-TDDFT), we study the interaction of energetic ions and electrons with the modified polymer surfaces, to validate the obtained functionalizations as effectively enhanced etch-resistance strategies. The computational results provide valuable insights on the complex physical, chemical, and dynamic ion and electron interactions with functionalized polymer photoresists, with the immediate consequence of allowing the extraction of definite strategies for improving photoresist polymer performance.

SO MOLECULAR BIOLOGY OF THE CELL

ID IMPORTIN-BETA; NUCLEOCYTOPLASMIC TRANSPORT; NUCLEOPORINS; MECHANISM;
   TRANSLOCATION; DIFFUSION
AB Macromolecules are transported through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) via a series of transient binding and unbinding events with FG-Nups, which are intrinsically disordered proteins anchored to the pore's inner wall. Prior studies suggest that the weak and transient nature of this binding is crucial for maintaining the transported molecules' diffusivity. In this study, we explored the relationship between binding kinetics and transport efficiency using Brownian dynamics simulations. Our results indicate that the duration of binding is a critical factor in regulating transport efficiency. Specifically, excessively short binding durations insufficiently facilitate transport, while overly long durations impede molecular movement. We calculated the optimal binding duration for efficient molecular transport and found that it aligns with other theoretical predictions. Additionally, the calculated value is comparable to experimental measurements of the association timescale between nuclear transport receptors and FG-Nups at a single binding site. Our study provides a quantitative framework that bridges local molecular interactions with overall transport dynamics through the NPC, offering valuable insights into the mechanisms governing selective molecular transport.

AB Reimaging telescopes have an accessible exit pupil that facilitates stray light mitigation and matching to auxiliary optical systems. Freeform surfaces present the opportunity for unobscured reflective systems to be folded into geometries that are otherwise impracticable with conventional surface types. It is critical, however, to understand the limitations of the enabled folding geometries and choose the one that best balances the optical performance and mechanical requirements. Here, we used the aberration theory of freeform surfaces to determine the aberration correction potential for using freeform surfaces in reimaging three-mirror telescopes and established a hierarchy for the different folding geometries without using optimization. We found that when using freeform optics, the ideal folding geometry had 9x better wavefront performance compared to the next best geometry. Within that ideal geometry, the system using freeform optics had 39% better wavefront performance compared to a system using off-axis asphere surfaces, thus quantifying one of the advantages of freeform optics in this design space.

AB The goal of this study was to determine whether learning processes and outcomes are affected by the emotional tone of the computer-generated voice in a narrated slideshow. In a between-subjects design, participants viewed a narrated slideshow on lightning formation involving a computer-generated female (Experiment 1) or male voice (Experiment 2) that displayed happy, content, angry, or sad emotion. On subsequent surveys and post-tests, students could recognize positive or negative emotions conveyed by the female voice but not the male voice. The emotional tone of the instructor's voices had minimal impact on students' ratings of felt emotion during learning, ratings of social connection with the instructor, or scores on retention and transfer tests of learning outcome. The findings highlight the limitations of computer-generated voices to convey emotions that trigger affective, social, and cognitive processes when an onscreen instructor is absent, thereby suggesting a boundary condition for the cognitive-affective model of e-learning.

AB Nucleic acid tests are key tools for the detection and diagnosis of many diseases. In many cases, the amplification of the nucleic acids is required to reach a detectable level. To make nucleic acid amplification tests more accessible to a point-of-care (POC) setting, isothermal amplification can be performed with a simple heating source. Although these tests are being performed in bulk reactions, the quantification is not as accurate as it would be with digital amplification. Here, we introduce the use of the vibrating sharp-tip capillary for a simple and portable system for tunable on-demand droplet generation. Because of the large range of droplet sizes possible and the tunability of the vibrating sharp-tip capillary, a high dynamic range (similar to 2 to 6000 copies/mu L) digital droplet loop-mediated isothermal amplification (ddLAMP) system has been developed. It was also noted that by changing the type of capillary on the vibrating sharp-tip capillary, the same mechanism can be used for simple and portable DNA fragmentation. With the incorporation of these elements, the present work paves the way for achieving digital nucleic acid tests in a POC setting with limited resources.

AB The ability to synthesize elastomeric materials with programmable mechanical properties is vital for advanced soft matter applications. Due to the inherent complexity of hierarchical structure-property correlations in brush-like polymer networks, the application of conventional theory-based, so-called Human Intelligence (HI) approaches becomes increasingly difficult. Herein we developed a design strategy based on synergistic combination of HI and AI tools which allows precise encoding of mechanical properties with three architectural parameters: degrees of polymerization (DP) of network strands, n(x), side chains, n(sc), backbone spacers between side chains, n(g). Implementing a multilayer feedforward artificial neural network (ANN), we took advantage of model-predicted structure-property cross correlations between coarse-grained system code including chemistry specific characteristics S = [l, v, b] defined by monomer projection length l and excluded volume v, Kuhn length b of bare backbone and side chains, and architecture A = [n(sc), n(g), n(x)] of polymer networks and their equilibrium mechanical properties P = [G, beta] including the structural shear modulus G and firmness parameter beta. The ANN was trained by minimizing the mean-square error with Bayesian regularization to avoid overfitting using a data set of experimental stress-deformation curves of networks with brush-like strands of poly(n-butyl acrylate), poly(isobutylene), and poly(dimethylsiloxane) having structural modulus G < 50 kPa and 0.01 <= beta <= 0.3. The trained ANN predicts network mechanical properties with 95% confidence. The developed ANN was implemented for synthesis of model networks with identical mechanical properties but different chemistries of network strands.

AB There exists a puzzling disagreement between the results for the neutron lifetime obtained in experiments using the beam technique versus those relying on the bottle method. A possible explanation of this discrepancy postulates the existence of a beyond-Standard-Model decay channel of the neutron involving new particles in the final state, some of which can be dark matter candidates. We review the current theoretical status of this proposal and discuss the particle physics models accommodating such a dark decay. We then elaborate on the efforts undertaken to test this hypothesis, summarizing the prospects for probing neutron dark decay channels in future experiments.

TI Small scale quasigeostrophic convective turbulence at large Rayleigh
   number
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW FLUIDS
LA English
DT Article
AB A numerical investigation of an asymptotically reduced model for quasigeostrophic Rayleigh-Benard convection is conducted in which the depth-averaged flows are numerically suppressed by modifying the governing equations. At the largest accessible values of the Rayleigh number Ra, the Reynolds number and Nusselt number show evidence of approaching the diffusion-free scalings of Re & SIM; RaE/Pr and Nu & SIM; Pr-1/2Ra3/2E2, respectively, where E is the Ekman number and Pr is the Prandtl number. For large Ra, the presence of depth-invariant flows, such as large-scale vortices, yield heat and momentum transport scalings that exceed those of the diffusion-free scaling laws. The Taylor microscale does not vary significantly with increasing Ra, whereas the integral length scale grows weakly. The computed length scales remain O(1) with respect to the linearly unstable critical wave number; we therefore conclude that these scales remain viscously controlled. We do not find a point-wise Coriolis-inertia-Archimedean (CIA) force balance in the turbulent regime; interior dynamics are instead dominated by horizontal advection (inertia), vortex stretching (Coriolis) and the vertical pressure gradient. A secondary, subdominant balance between the Archimedean buoyancy force and the viscous force occurs in the interior and the ratio of the root mean square (rms) of these two forces is found to approach unity with increasing Ra. This secondary balance is attributed to the turbulent fluid interior acting as the dominant control on the heat transport. These findings indicate that a pointwise CIA balance does not occur in the high Rayleigh number regime of quasigeostrophic convection in the plane layer geometry. Instead, simulations are characterized by what may be termed a nonlocal CIA balance in which the buoyancy force is dominant within the thermal boundary layers and is spatially separated from the interior Coriolis and inertial forces.

AB Facial impressions have long been argued to be driven by two independent dimensions of trustworthiness and dominance. However, in an intergroup context, we reasoned that these dimensions may shift predictably and become more positively related for ingroup members, yet negatively related for outgroup members, due to dominance signaling outgroup threat and/or ingroup prosociality. In two studies, we examined how the two dimensions shift across minimal group boundaries for White targets. In Study 1, core dimensions of trustworthiness and dominance became intertwined with each other differently for ingroup and outgroup targets. In Study 2, stronger stereotypic beliefs that trustworthiness approximate to dominance for ingroup than outgroup mediated the shifts in facial impression dimensions. This work advances our understanding of facial impressions and intergroup bias by showing that the facial impression dimensions are not fixed but may shift across group boundaries and that such shifts occur above and beyond simple ingroup favoritism.

AB How does the emotional tone (happy or sad) and gender (male or female) of the instructor's computer-generated voice in a multimedia lesson affect learning processes and outcomes for female learners (Experiment 1) and male learners (Experiment 2)? In two experiments, college students viewed a 2.5 min narrated slideshow on the formation of lightning and then took a posttest. In a 2 (emotion) x 2 (gender) between-subjects design, the instructor's computer-generated voice was either happy female, sad female, happy male, or sad male, as produced by text-to-speech software. Female students (in Experiment 1) who received happy instructors gave higher ratings of instructor happiness, their own felt happiness, and how engaging and facilitative the instructor was, indicating that they could perceive, feel, and socially relate to the voice's emotion, and these effects were stronger for the female voice than the male voice. Male students (in Experiment 2) showed the same pattern for perceived emotion, partially for felt emotion, and not for social connection with the instructor. In terms of learning outcomes, happy instructors produced better transfer test scores only for males and did not produce better retention test scores for males or females. These results provide partial support for the positivity principle, which posits that people learn better from happy instructors than from sad instructors and indicate that the instructor's gender plays a moderating role.

AB Following an extreme event, efficient restoration of infrastructure functionality is a paramount task for sustaining community lifelines. With the overall goal of improving the rapidity of infra-structure restoration, the objective of this research is to forecast up-to-date infrastructure restora-tion progress considering associated uncertainties through integrating Bayesian inference and earned schedule. In this research, beta cumulative distribution function is assumed to represent infrastructure restoration progress. As infrastructure restoration progresses, Bayesian inference with Markov chain Monte Carlo is applied to update the planned restoration progress. Based on the updated progress, earned schedule and Monte Carlo simulation are specialized to forecast the future restoration progress as well as considering restoration-associated uncertainties. A case study on power infrastructure restoration during Hurricane Irma at Miami-Dade County was pre-sented. The results demonstrate the updating capability of the proposed approach and underline the importance of plan updating during infrastructure restoration. In practice, a reliable and up-to-date progress forecasting better informs practitioners to understand the latest infrastructure restoration status, thereby enhancing restoration operations to impacted communities in a timely manner.

AB We address the problem of behind-the-meter EV charging by a prosumer, co-optimized with rooftop solar, electric battery, and flexible consumption devices such as water heaters and HVAC systems. We consider a scenario involving a time-of-use net energy metering tariff, alongside stochastic solar production and random EV charging demand, a finite-horizon surplus-maximization problem is formulated. We show that a procrastination threshold policy that delays EV charging to the last possible moment is optimal when EV charging is co-optimized with flexible demand, and the policy thresholds can be easily computed offline. When battery storage is part of the co-optimization, we show that the prosumer's net consumption is a two-threshold piecewise linear function of the behind-the-meter renewable generation under the optimal policy, and the procrastination threshold policy remains optimal, although the thresholds cannot be computed easily. We propose a straightforward myopic solution which becomes optimal strategy when the storage state of charge doesn't reach boundary, and demonstrate in a numerical simulation that involves real-world data.

AB This study presents the market for carbon management capacity via carbon capture, utilization, and storage technologies, identifying demand and supply forces, as well as clarifying the potential impact of market and non- market-based shocks on technology developers versus adopters. The paper addresses a prevailing gap in market analysis, introducing a microeconomic framework and unique dataset to identify key players, market forces, and policy incentives shaping the carbon capture, utilization, and storage landscape. The analysis equips industry stakeholders, policymakers, and investors with valuable insights regarding (1) leaders in the design, development, and manufacture of carbon capture, utilization, and storage technologies (supply), (2) early technology adopters (demand) who are at the forefront in the pursuit of sustainable carbon management, and (3) the need to use both market and non-market forces to achieve decarbonization across multiple sectors.

AB Feminicide is the gender-related killing of cisgender and transgender women and girls. It reflects patriarchal and racialized systems of oppression and reveals how territories and socio-economic landscapes configure everyday gender-related violence. In recent decades, many grassroots data production initiatives have emerged with the aim of monitoring this extreme but invisibilized phenomenon. We bridge scholarship in feminist and information geographies with data feminism to examine the ways in which space, broadly defined, shapes the counterdata production strategies of feminicide data activists. Drawing on a qualitative study of 33 monitoring efforts led by civil society organizations across 15 countries, primarily in Latin America, we provide a conceptual framework for examining the spatial dimensions of data activism. We show how there are striking transnational patterns related to where feminicide goes unrecorded, resulting in geographies of missing data. In response to these omissions, activists deploy multiple spatialized strategies to make these geographies visible, to situate and contextualize each case of feminicide, to reclaim databases as spaces for memory and witnessing, and to build transnational networks of solidarity. In this sense, we argue that data activism about feminicide constitutes a space of resistance and resignification of everyday forms of gender-related violence.

AB In current software applications, numerous vulnerabilities may be present. Attackers attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities, leading to security breaches, unauthorized entry, data theft, or the incapacitation of computer systems. Instead of addressing software or hardware vulnerabilities at a later stage, it is better to address them immediately or during the development phase. Tools such as AIBugHunter provide solutions designed to tackle software issues by predicting, categorizing, and fixing coding vulnerabilities. Essentially, developers can see where their code is susceptible to attacks and obtain details about the nature and severity of these vulnerabilities. AIBugHunter incorporates VulRepair to detect and repair vulnerabilities. VulRepair currently predicts patches for vulnerable functions at 44%. To be truly effective, this number needs to be increased. This study examines VulRepair to see whether the 44% perfect prediction can be increased. VulRepair is based on T5 and uses both natural language and programming languages during its pretraining phase, along with byte pair encoding. T5 is a text-to-text transfer transformer model with an encoder and decoder as part of its neural network. It outperforms other models such as VRepair and CodeBERT. However, the hyperparameters may not be optimized due to the development of new optimizers. We reviewed a deep neural network (DNN) optimizer developed by Google in 2023. This optimizer, the Evolved Sign Momentum (LION), is available in PyTorch. We applied LION to VulRepair and tested its influence on the hyperparameters. After adjusting the hyperparameters, we obtained a 56% perfect prediction, which exceeds the value of the VulRepair report of 44%. This means that VulRepair can repair more vulnerabilities and avoid more attacks. As far as we know, our approach utilizing an alternative to AdamW, the standard optimizer, has not been previously applied to enhance VulRepair and similar models.

AB Our understanding of the fundamental role that soil bacteria play in the structure and functioning of Earth's ecosystems is ever expanding, but insight into the nature of interactions within these bacterial communities remains rudimentary. Bacterial facilitation may enhance the establishment, growth, and succession of eukaryotic biota, elevating the complexity and diversity of the entire soil community and thereby modulating multiple ecosystem functions. Global climate change often alters soil bacterial community composition, which, in turn, impacts other dependent biota. However, the impact of climate change on facilitation within bacterial communities remains poorly understood even though it may have important cascading consequences for entire ecosystems. The wealth of metagenomic data currently being generated gives community ecologists the ability to investigate bacterial facilitation in the natural world and how it affects ecological systems responses to climate change. Here, we review current evidence demonstrating the importance of facilitation in promoting emergent properties such as community diversity, ecosystem functioning, and resilience to climate change in soil bacterial communities. We show that a synthesis is currently missing between the abundant data, newly developed models and a coherent ecological framework that addresses these emergent properties. We highlight that including phylogenetic information, the physicochemical environment, and species-specific ecologies can improve our ability to infer interactions in natural soil communities. Following these recommendations, studies on bacterial facilitation will be an important piece of the puzzle to understand the consequences of global change on ecological communities and a model to advance our understanding of facilitation in complex communities more generally.

AB Mounting evidence suggests that fishing can be a major driver of coral-to-macroalgae regime shifts on tropical reefs. In many small-scale coral reef fisheries, fishers target herbivorous fishes, which can weaken coral resilience via reduced herbivory on macroalgae that then outcompete corals. Previous models that explored the effects of harvesting herbivores revealed hysteresis in the herbivory-benthic state relationship that results in bistability of coral- and macroalgae-dominated states over some levels of fishing pressure, which has been supported by empirical evidence. However, past models have not accounted for the functional differences among herbivores or how fisher selectivity for different herbivore functional groups may alter the benthic dynamics and resilience. Here, we use a dynamic model that links differential fishing on two key herbivore functional groups to the outcome of competitive dynamics between coral and macroalgae. We show that reef state depends not only on the level of fishing but also on the types of herbivores targeted by fishers. Selectively fishing browsing herbivores that are capable of consuming mature macroalgae (e.g., unicornfish) increases precariousness of the coral state by moving the system close to the coral-to-macroalgae tipping point. By contrast, selectively harvesting grazing herbivores that are only capable of preventing macroalgae from becoming established (e.g., parrotfishes) can increase catch yields substantially more before the tipping point is reached. However, this lower precariousness with increasing fishing effort comes at the cost of increasing the range of fishing effort over which coral and macroalgae are bistable; increasing hysteresis makes a regime shift triggered by a disturbance more difficult or impractical to reverse. Our results suggest that management strategies for small-scale coral reef fisheries should consider how functional differences among harvested herbivores coupled with fisher selectivity influence benthic dynamics in light of the trade-off between tipping point precariousness and coral recovery dynamics following large disturbances.

AB We use thermal noise induced currents to image the real and imaginary parts of the conductivity of a body. Covariances of the thermal noise currents measured at a few electrodes are shown to be related to a deterministic problem. We use the covariances obtained while selectively heating the body to recover the real power density in the body under known boundary conditions and at a known frequency. The resulting inverse problem is related to acousto-electric tomography, but where the conductivity is complex and only the real power is measured. We study the local solvability of this problem by determining where its linearization is elliptic. Numerical experiments illustrating this inverse problem are included.

AB High-Resolution Images are being used in various applications, including Medical Imaging, Satellite Imagery, and Surveillance. Due to the evolution of Deep Learning (DL) and its widespread usage, it has also become a prominent choice for high-resolution image applications. But, large image sizes and denser convolutional neural networks pose limitations over computation and memory requirements. To overcome these challenges, several studies have discussed efficient approaches to accelerate training, but the inference of high-resolution images with deep learning and quantization techniques remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose accelerated and memory efficient inference techniques leveraging quantization techniques to reduce the memory and computation requirements while maintaining accuracy. Furthermore, we utilize different parallelism for Distributed DL to enable inference for high-resolution images on out-of-core models. We demonstrate an average 6.5x speedup and 4.55x memory reduction with a single GPU using INT8 quantization. By utilizing Distributed DL, we enabled inference for scaled images, achieving an average 1.58x speedup and 1.57x memory reduction using half-precision. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first in the literature to focus on highresolution image inference using quantization with the support of Distributed DL.

AB An automotive diffuser is an open channel within the underbody of a vehicle that features a diverging ramp in the aft section. The performance of a diffuser is sensitive to ground effect where decreases in ride height result in increases in downforce. However, below a critical value, any further reduction in ride height results in a significant loss of downforce. Previous experimental investigations demonstrated that the dominant flow feature within underbody diffuser flows is a pair of counter-rotating longitudinal vortices, and the resulting downforce behavior is directly linked to the structure of the longitudinal vortex pair. This study investigates the effect of ride height on the behavior of the longitudinal vortex pair within an underbody diffuser flow in ground effect. The unsteady flow past a diffuser-equipped bluff body with a 17 degrees diffuser ramp angle is simulated using large eddy simulation with wall-stress modeling, commonly referred to as wall modeled large eddy simulation (WMLES). The flow Reynolds number based on body length is 1.75 x 10(6). Numerical simulations are performed with OpenFOAM and WMLES is implemented with libWallModelledLES, a third-party WMLES library for OpenFOAM. Results show that the mean center-line surface pressure distributions along the underbody match well with experiments. Visualization of the vortices with isosurfaces of the Q-criterion demonstrates that the longitudinal vortices experience a spiral-type vortex breakdown which propagates upstream with decreasing ride height.

AB Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) measurements of intact cell walls and cellular samples often generate spectra that are difficult to interpret due to the presence of many coexisting glycans and the structural polymorphism observed in native conditions. To overcome this analytical challenge, we present a statistical approach for analyzing carbohydrate signals using high-resolution ssNMR data indexed in a carbohydrate database. We generate simulated spectra to demonstrate the chemical shift dispersion and compare this with experimental data to facilitate the identification of important fungal and plant polysaccharides, such as chitin and glucans in fungi and cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectic polymers in plants. We also demonstrate that chemically distinct carbohydrates from different organisms may produce almost identical signals, highlighting the need for high-resolution spectra and validation of resonance assignments. Our study provides a means to differentiate the characteristic signals of major carbohydrates and allows us to summarize currently undetected polysaccharides in plants and fungi, which may inspire future investigations.

AB Human ratings are ubiquitous in creativity research. Yet, the process of rating responses to creativity tasks - typically several hundred or thousands of responses, per rater - is often time-consuming and expensive. Planned missing data designs, where raters only rate a subset of the total number of responses, have been recently proposed as one possible solution to decrease overall rating time and monetary costs. However, researchers also need ratings that adhere to psychometric standards, such as a certain degree of reliability, and psychometric work with planned missing designs is currently lacking in the literature. In this work, we introduce how judge response theory and simulations can be used to fine-tune planning of missing data designs. We provide open code for the community and illustrate our proposed approach by a cost-effectiveness calculation based on a realistic example. We clearly show that fine-tuning helps to save time (to perform the ratings) and monetary costs, while simultaneously targeting expected levels of reliability.

AB In applications involving fretting wear damage, surfaces with high yield strength and wear resistance are required. In this study, the mechanical responses of materials with graded nanostructured surfaces during fretting sliding are investigated and compared to homogeneous materials through a systematic computational study. A three-dimensional finite element model is developed to characterize the fretting sliding characteristics and shakedown behavior with varying degrees of contact friction and gradient layer thicknesses. Results obtained using a representative model material (i.e., 304 stainless steel) demonstrate that metallic materials with a graded nanostructured surface could exhibit a more than 80% reduction in plastically deformed surface areas and volumes, resulting in superior fretting damage resistance in comparison to homogeneous coarse-grained metals. In particular, a graded nanostructured material can exhibit elastic or plastic shakedown, depending on the contact friction coefficient. Optimal fretting resistance can be achieved for the graded nanostructured material by decreasing the friction coefficient (e.g., from 0.6 to 0.4 in 304 stainless steel), resulting in an elastic shakedown behavior, where the plastically deformed volume and area exhibit zero increment in the accumulated plastic strain during further sliding. These findings in the graded nanostructured materials using 304 stainless steel as a model system can be further tailored for engineering optimal fretting damage resistance.

AB Conformer, a convolution-augmented Transformer variant, has become the de facto encoder architecture for speech processing due to its superior performance in various tasks, including automatic speech recognition (ASR), speech translation (ST) and spoken language understanding (SLU). Recently, a new encoder called E-Branchformer has outperformed Conformer in the LibriSpeech ASR benchmark, making it promising for more general speech applications. This work compares E-Branchformer and Conformer through extensive experiments using different types of end-to-end sequence-to-sequence models. Results demonstrate that E-Branchformer achieves comparable or better performance than Conformer in almost all evaluation sets across 15 ASR, 2 ST, and 3 SLU benchmarks, while being more stable during training. We will release our training configurations and pre-trained models for reproducibility, which can benefit the speech community. (1)

AB Asphaltenes, a major and undesirable component of heavy crude oil, contain many different types of large aromatic compounds. These compounds include nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic compounds that are thought to be the main culprit in the deactivation of catalysts in crude oil refinery processes. Unfortunately, prevention of this is challenging as the structures and properties of the nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic compounds are poorly understood. To facilitate their structural characterization, an approach based on ion-trap collision-activated dissociation (ITCAD) tandem mass spectrometry followed by energy-resolved medium-energy collision-activated dissociation (ER-MCAD) was developed for the differentiation of seven isomeric molecular radical cations of n-pentylquinoline. The fragmentation of each isomer was found to be distinctly different and depended largely on the site of the alkyl side chain in the quinoline ring. In order to better understand the observed fragmentation pathways, mechanisms for the formation of several fragment ions were delineated based on quantum chemical calculations. The fast benzylic alpha- bond cleavage that dominates the fragmentation of analogous nonheteroaromatic alkylbenzenes was only observed for the 3-isomer as the major pathway due to the lack of favorable low-energy rearrangement reactions. All the other isomeric ions underwent substantially lower-energy rearrangement reactions as their alkyl chains were found to interact mostly via 6-membered transition states either with the quinoline nitrogen (2-and 8-isomers) or the adjacent carbon atom in the quinoline core (4-, 5-, 6-, and 7 isomers), which lowered the activation energies of the fragmentation reactions. The presented analytical approach will facilitate the structural characterization of nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic compounds in asphaltenes.

AB Featured Application This research falls within the scope of safety sciences, specifically contributing to the field of construction safety. The primary focus of this study is to enhance construction workplace safety through the evaluation of individual psychophysiological parameters. These parameters, when thoroughly examined, have the potential to benefit multiple stakeholders in the construction industry, both during and after the hiring and safety training stages. Findings from this study will provide valuable insights into how workplace stressors can impair workers' near-miss detection capabilities and safety behavior within the construction enterprise.Abstract Despite the introduction of preventive safety measures, such as near-miss reporting, to mitigate accidents and minimize fatalities, construction workers are constantly exposed to stressful situations that negatively affect their safety behavior and reporting efficiency. Occupational stress is induced by various factors, with mental stress and auditory stress being common workplace stressors that impact workers on the job site. While previous studies have demonstrated the effect of stressor conditions on workers' hazard recognition and safety performance, research gaps persist regarding the direct impact of workplace stressors on workers' stress levels and near-miss recognition performance. This study investigates workers' near-miss recognition ability through an eye-tracking experiment conducted in a controlled environment under mental and auditory stress conditions. The findings from this study reveal that workplace stressors triggered by mental and auditory stress can adversely affect worker stress levels, safety behavior, and cognitive processing toward near-miss recognition. Visual attention towards near-miss scenarios was reduced by 26% for mental stress conditions and by 46% for auditory stress conditions compared to baseline. The results may potentially open avenues for developing wearable stress prediction and safety intervention models using bio-sensing technology and personalized safety training programs tailored to individuals with low identification abilities.

AB Constrained formation problems, for quadrotors and other systems, have been examined in various works in the past decade. Nevertheless, most works only consider constant or time-varying constraint functions, to be best of our knowledge. In this work, we examine path-dependent constraint requirements during formation tracking operations by a team of quadrotors, where the constraints are functions on path parameters. Universal barrier functions are used to deal with path-dependent constraint requirements, including constraints on distances with desired paths and inter-vehicle distances. Furthermore, unknown quadrotor's mass, inertia, and disturbances are addressed using an adaptive robust formation algorithm. The newly proposed path-dependent constrained formation architecture can ensure formation tracking errors converge exponentially to small neighborhoods near the equilibrium, with all path-dependent constraint requirements met. At the end, a simulation study further illustrates the proposed scheme and demonstrates its efficacy.

AB Ecosystem responses to disturbance depend on the nature of the perturbation and the ecological legacies left behind, making it critical to understand how climate-driven changes in disturbance regimes modify resilience properties of ecosystems. For coral reefs, recent increases in severe marine heat waves now co-occur with powerful storms, the historic agent of disturbance. While storms kill coral and remove their skeletons, heat waves bleach and kill corals but leave their skeletons intact. Here, we explored how the material legacy of dead coral skeletons modifies two key ecological processes that underpin coral reef resilience: the ability of herbivores to control macroalgae (spatial competitors of corals), and the replenishment of new coral colonies. Our findings, grounded by a major bleaching event at our long-term study locale, revealed that the presence of structurally complex dead skeletons reduced grazing on turf algae by similar to 80%. For macroalgae, browsing was reduced by >40% on less preferred (unpalatable) taxa, but only by similar to 10% on more preferred taxa. This enabled unpalatable macroalgae to reach similar to 45% cover in 2 years. By contrast, herbivores prevented macroalgae from becoming established on adjacent reefs that lacked skeletons. Manipulation of unpalatable macroalgae revealed that the cover reached after 1 year (similar to 20%) reduced recruitment of corals by 50%. The effect of skeletons on juvenile coral growth was contingent on the timing of settlement relative to the disturbance. If corals settled directly after bleaching (before macroalgae colonized), dead skeletons enhanced colony growth by 34%, but this benefit was lost if corals colonized dead skeletons a year after the disturbance once macroalgae had proliferated. These findings underscore how a material legacy from a changing disturbance regime can alter ecosystem resilience properties by disrupting key trophic and competitive interactions that shape post-disturbance community dynamics.

AB In recent years, advances in construction site image analysis faced challenges, particularly in construction object detection and identifying unsafe actions. Challenges involve complex backgrounds, varying object sizes, and image quality. Existing methods address spatial and temporal features with attention mechanisms but often overlook adaptive sampling and channel-wise adjustments, missing potential spatiotemporal redundancies. This article introduces the Optimized Positioning (OP-Net) architectures and an attention-based spatiotemporal sampling approach. The OP module is introduced for object detection, which enhances channel relationships by leveraging global feature affinity associations. Additionally, we propose an innovative spatiotemporal sampling strategy that adapts to effectively identify unsafe actions in construction sites. We extensively evaluate the object detection task using the SODA dataset to showcase the efficacy and effectiveness of our approach. Furthermore, our unsafe action identification model is benchmarked on the CMA dataset, demonstrating its ability to achieve new state-of-the-art performance in accuracy while maintaining reasonable computational efficiency.

AB Archaeological data often come in the form of counts. Understanding why counts of artifacts, subsistence remains, or features vary across time and space is central to archaeological inquiry. A central statistical method to model such variation is through regression, yet despite sophisticated advances in computational approaches to archaeology, practitioners do not have a standard approach for building, validating, or interpreting the results of count regression. Drawing on advances in ecology, we outline a framework for evaluating regressions with archaeological count data that includes suggestions for model fitting, diagnostics, and interpreting results. We hope these suggestions provide a foundation for advancing regression with archaeological count data to further our understanding of the past.

AB Policymakers and intermediary organizations have focused on secondary computer science (CS) as a policy goal with 30 states requiring high schools to offer CS, 37 states counting CS as math or science course, and 8 states mandating CS as a graduation requirement in 2023. This qualitative study unveils preliminary findings from focus groups with Computer Science Education State Supervisors (CSEdSS) (n=11). CSEdSS were asked about the impact, implementation, and perspectives of secondary CS policies. Using a complex systems lens, we identify accelerators and policy tensions related to secondary CS education implementation from the perspectives of CSEdSS and discuss ways in which researchers and policymakers can collaborate to advance equitable CS education.

AB Hemodynamic signals, such as Electrocardiogram (ECG), Photoplethysmography (PPG), and Electrical Bioimpedance (EBI), provide a myriad of critical health indicators. For instance, ECG is utilized by cardiologists to diagnose a range of cardiovascular diseases, PPG estimates blood oxygen levels, and EBI gauges vascular flow. A multimodal device capable of continuously monitoring these signals can furnish healthcare professionals with profound insights into patient well-being. This paper introduces a hardware design for a programmable, wearable device that measures multiple physiological signals, including ECG, PPG, and EBI. Equipped with an onboard microprocessor, the device enables real-time data processing. Compact and efficient, the system measures just 60.5mm by 38.75mm, has low-power dissipation, and is powered by a coin cell battery. Using largely discrete commercial components and a custom electrode array, the open-source hardware allows for rapid configurability and broad usage applications within the health monitoring domain.

AB This study examined how well people can recognize and relate to animated pedagogical agents of varying ethnicities/races and genders. For both Study 1 (realistic-style agents) and Study 2 (cartoon-style agents), participants viewed brief video clips of virtual agents of varying racial/ethnic categories and gender types and then identified their race/ethnicity and gender and rated how human-like and likable the agent appeared. Participants were highly accurate in identifying Black and White agents but were less accurate for Asian, Indian, and Hispanic agents. Participants were accurate in recognizing gender differences. Participants rated all types of agents as moderately human-like, except for White agents. Likability ratings were lowest for White and male agents. The same pattern of results was obtained across two independent studies with different participants and different onscreen agents, which indicates that the results are not solely due to one specific set of agents. Consistent with the Media Equation Hypothesis and the Alliance Hypothesis, this work shows that people are sensitive to the race/ethnicity and gender of onscreen agents and relate to them differently. These findings have implications for how to design animated pedagogical agents for improved multimedia learning environments in the future and serve as a crucial first step in highlighting the possibility and feasibility of incorporating diverse onscreen virtual agents into educational computer software.

AB Nonhost resistance (NHR) refers to the immunity of most tested genotypes of a plant species to most tested variants of a pathogen species. Thus, NHR is broad spectrum and durable in nature and constitutes a major safety barrier against invasion of a myriad of potentially pathogenic microbes in any plants including domesticated crops. Genetic study of NHR is generally more difficult compared to host resistance mainly because NHR is genetically more complicated and often lacks intraspecific polymorphisms. Nevertheless, substantial progress has been made towards the understanding of the molecular basis of NHR in the past two decades using various approaches. Not surprisingly, molecular mechanisms of NHR revealed so far encompasses pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity and effector-triggered immunity. In this review, we briefly discuss the inherent difficulty in genetic studies of NHR and summarize the main approaches that have been taken to identify genes contributing to NHR. We also discuss new enabling strategies for dissecting multilayered NHR in model plants with a focus on NHR against filamentous pathogens, especially biotrophic pathogens such as powdery mildew and rust fungi.

AB Demographic fairness has become a critical objective when developing modern visual models for identity-sensitive applications, such as face attribute recognition (FAR). While great efforts have been made to improve the fairness of the models, the investigation on the adversarial robustness of the fairness (e.g., whether the fairness of the models could still be maintained under potential malicious fairness attacks) is largely ignored. Therefore, this paper explores the adversarial robustness of demographic fairness in FAR applications from both attacking and defending perspectives. In particular, we firstly present a novel fairness attack, who aims at corrupting the demographic fairness of face attribute classifiers. Next, to mitigate the effect of the fairness attack, we design an efficient defense algorithm called robust-fair training. With this defense, face attribute classifiers learn how to combat the bias introduced by the fairness attack. As such, the face attribute classifiers are not only trained to be fair, but the fairness is also robust. Our extensive experimental results show the effectiveness of both our proposed attack and defense methods across various model architectures and FAR applications. We believe our work could be strong baselines for future work on robust-fair AI models.

AB Highly publicized instances of social injustice have raised awareness of inequities and motivated people with advantaged identities to work to end oppression and advocate for members of marginalized groups - in other words, to act as 'allies'. When successful, engaging in allyship can promote marginalized individuals' belonging and well-being. However, actions meant to convey allyship can be ineffective or harmful. Thus, it is important to understand how people might act as effective allies - that is, how they might enact allyship efforts that marginalized group members identify as meaningful and that promote psychological benefits for these groups. In this Review, we outline a framework of effective allyship that posits four key and related components: awareness, authentic motivation, action orientation and all-inclusivity. More specifically, taking part in allyship entails acknowledging systemic bias and privileged identities, being motivated by personal values, engaging in high-effort and consistent ally actions, and supporting all members of a marginalized group, including those with multiply marginalized identities. We discuss research supporting the importance of each element, focusing on work with marginalized individuals, and we describe ally interventions. When carefully considered and tailored to relevant marginalized groups, these four components are crucial to acting as an effective ally and fostering welcoming climates.

AB Ensuring fairness is crucial in developing modern algorithms and tests. To address potential biases and discrimination in algorithmic decision making, researchers have drawn insights from the test fairness literature, notably the work on differential algorithmic functioning (DAF) by Suk and Han. Nevertheless, the exploration of intersectionality in fairness investigations, within both test fairness and algorithmic fairness fields, is still relatively new. In this paper, we propose an extension of the DAF framework to include the concept of intersectionality. Similar to DAF, the proposed notion for intersectionality, which we term "interactive DAF," leverages ideas from test fairness and algorithmic fairness. We also provide methods based on the generalized Mantel-Haenszel test, generalized logistic regression, and regularized group regression to detect DAF, interactive DAF, or other subtypes of DAF. Specifically, we employ regularized group regression with three different penalties and examine their performance via a simulation study. Finally, we demonstrate our intersectional DAF framework in real-world applications on grade retention and conditional cash transfer programs in education.

AB Zwitterions (ZIs), which are molecules bearing an equal number of positive and negative charges and typically possessing large dipole moments, can play an important role in improving the characteristics of a wide variety of novel battery electrolytes. Significant Coulombic interactions among ZI charged groups and any mobile ions present can lead to several beneficial phenomena within electrolytes, such as increased salt dissociation, the formation of ordered pathways for ion transport, and enhanced mechanical robustness. In some cases, ZI additives can also boost electrochemical stability at the electrolyte/electrode interface and enable longer battery cycling. Here, a brief summary of selected key historical and recent advances in the use of ZI materials to enrich the performance of three distinct classes of battery electrolytes is presented. These include: ionic liquid-based, conventional solvent-based, and solid matrix-based (non-ceramic) electrolytes. Exploring a greater chemical diversity of ZI types and electrolyte pairings will likely lead to more discoveries that can empower next-generation battery designs in the years to come.
   Zwitterions possess an ability to improve the performance of a number of different battery electrolytes. Desirable zwitterion-enabled effects may include: increased salt dissociation, enhanced ion transport, beneficial solid electrolyte interphase formation, and Coulombic cross-linking. Many opportunities remain to more fully realize the potential benefits that these versatile inner salts can provide toward the realization of high-performance battery electrolytes. image

AB The prevalence of natural hazards and extreme climatic events highlights the critical importance of disaster recovery for communities. In this study, we examine the impact of Hurricane Harvey on private well water in Texas and explore the relationship between the contamination of well water, stewardship behavior, and demographic and social capital characteristics. We develop a multi-level regression model that shows bonding and linking social capital index, median house income, owner-occupied houses' percentage, and the percentage of households speaking only English correlate with people's vulnerability to unsafe drinking water supplies. We validate the results through a partial dependence framework built upon a random forest model. Our study provides valuable insights to address issues of fairness and vulnerability in society and foster resilience and preparedness in the face of shocks and hazards.

AB Geometrical defects (e.g., pores and lack of fusion) induced during powder bed fusion (PBF) pose a great challenge to fatigue performance for load-bearing structures. The random porosity may further cause uncertainty of fatigue behavior. Fatigue life and scattering bands are largely determined by the maximum size of a geometrical defect. Therefore, the prediction of the upper bound size of geometrical defects is critical. This work focuses on quantifying defect size and distribution to identify the extreme, life-limiting defect size that drives fatigue failure. A comprehensive analysis of the geometrical defects in PBF parts is presented. A statistics of extremes-based method is presented to predict the maximum defect. Defect size is measured using the Feret caliper (FC) diameter and then fitted to a cumulative distribution function (CDF) for linear regression modeling. The maximum defect size is then extrapolated from the regression line for a given probability. It is shown that multiple CDFs can be used for PBF defect size predictions, allowing for flexibility and optimization of prediction models. Furthermore, the FC diameter metric is proposed as the standard defect size metric due to its equivalent representation of 3D and 2D defects. (c) 2023 The Authors. Published by ELSEVIER Ltd.

AB The photodegradation of polymer materials represents a promising solution for addressing the challenges associated with plastic waste management within the environment. Vinyl ketone polymers, such as phenyl vinyl ketone (PVK), exhibit backbone degradation upon exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light. However, this property leads to significant degradation of PVK polymer materials within a few years under simulated sunlight conditions. While this is advantageous for waste management purposes, it can adversely impact the lifespan of these materials in practical applications. This study demonstrates a novel approach to control the degradation of PVK materials by incorporating a secondary network, based on poly(ethyl acrylate), within the polymer matrix. This approach allows for the manipulation of the material's mechanical properties while also enabling the controlled photodegradation of network materials.

AB We present the diffusiophoresis of ellipsoidal particles induced by ionic solute gradients. Contrary to the common expectation that diffusiophoresis is shape independent, here we show experimentally that this assump-tion breaks down when the thin Debye layer approximation is relaxed. By tracking the translation and rotation of various ellipsoids, we find that the phoretic mobility of ellipsoids is sensitive to the eccentricity and the orientation of the ellipsoid relative to the imposed solute gradient, and can further lead to nonmonotonic behavior under strong confinement. We show that such a shape-and orientation-dependent diffusiophoresis of colloidal ellipsoids can be easily captured by modifying theories for spheres.

AB Asian Americans are increasingly positioned at the center of current events, yet extant theories and approaches in social psychology (and social cognition specifically) may not adequately capture how Asian Americans are perceived and treated in the current American racial landscape. We propose three directions to propel social cognition research on Asian Americans. First, research emphasizes Asian Americans' perceived high status (e.g., the model minority stereotype) while often overlooking their perceived foreignness. The two-dimensional Racial Position Model elucidates the consequences of being stereotyped as perpetual foreigners for Asian Americans and their relations with other racial and ethnic groups. Second, research and laypeople alike consider East Asian Americans to be the prototypical Asian Americans, thereby excluding subgroups such as South and Southeast Asian Americans. Considering the ethnic diversity of Asian Americans challenges and extends existing social psychological theories. Lastly, much of psychological research approaches race in isolation without considering its intersection with other identities such as gender. An intersectional framework offers insights into how Asian Americans' gender and race overlap in our social cognition. More nuanced research on Asian Americans is needed to fully understand race relations in the 21st century and we hope these three interconnected directions can guide researchers who are interested in the topic.

AB Autonomous driving perceives surroundings with line-of-sight sensors that are compromised under environmental uncertainties. To achieve real time global information in high definition map, we investigate to share perception information among connected and automated vehicles. However, it is challenging to achieve real time perception sharing under varying network dynamics in automotive edge computing. In this paper, we propose a novel real time dynamic map, named LiveMap to detect, match, and track objects on the road. We design the data plane of LiveMap to efficiently process individual vehicle data with multiple sequential computation components, including detection, projection, extraction, matching and combination. We design the control plane of LiveMap to achieve adaptive vehicular offloading with two new algorithms (central and distributed) to balance the latency and coverage performance based on deep reinforcement learning techniques. We conduct extensive evaluation through both realistic experiments on a small-scale physical testbed and network simulations on an edge network simulator. The results suggest that LiveMap significantly outperforms existing solutions in terms of latency, coverage, and accuracy.

AB Sulfur cements have drawn significant attention as binders because sulfur is a byproduct of fossil fuel refining. Sulfur cements that can be formed by the vulcanization of elemental sulfur and plant-derived olefins such as terpenoids are particularly promising from a sustainability standpoint. A range of terpenoid-sulfur cements have shown compressional and flexural properties exceeding those of some commercial structural mineral cements. Pozzolans such as fly ash (FA), silica fume (SF), and ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) and abundant clay resources such as metakaolin (MK) are attractive fines for addition to binders. Herein, we report 10 composites prepared by a combination of sulfur, terpenoids (geraniol or citronellol), and these pozzolans. This study reveals the extent to which the addition of the pozzolan fines to the sulfur-terpenoid cements influences their mechanical properties and chemical resistance. The sulfur-terpenoid composites CitS and GerS were prepared by the reaction of 90 wt% sulfur and 10 wt% citronellol or geraniol oil, respectively. The density of the composites fell within the range of 1800-1900 kg/m(3) and after 24 h submersion in water at room temperature, none of the materials absorbed more than 0.7 wt% water. The compressional strength of the as-prepared materials ranged from 9.1-23.2 MPa, and the percentage of compressional strength retained after acid challenge (submersion in 0.1 M H2SO4 for 24 h) ranged from 80-100%. Incorporating pozzolan fines into the already strong CitS (18.8 MPa) had negligible effects on its compressional strength within the statistical error of the measurement. CitS-SF and CitS-MK had slightly higher compressive strengths of 20.4 MPa and 23.2 MPa, respectively. CitS-GGBFS and CitS-FA resulted in slightly lower compressive strengths of 17.0 MPa and 15.8 MPa, respectively. In contrast, the compressional strength of initially softer GerS (11.7 MPa) benefited greatly after incorporating hard mineral fines. All GerS derivatives had higher compressive strengths than GerS, with GerS-MK having the highest compressive strength of 19.8 MPa. The compressional strengths of several of the composites compare favorably to those required by traditional mineral cements for residential building foundations (17 MPa), whereas such mineral products disintegrate upon similar acid challenge.

AB Due to the ability to provide low latency, high dependability, and worldwide broadband coverage services, the development of integrated satellite-terrestrial networks has attracted significant interest from both industry and academia over the past few decades. However, the dynamic satellite topology, heterogeneous, expansive, and intricate properties of the integrated satellite-terrestrial network make routing tasks difficult. In this research, we design the distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model with the objective of minimizing the estimated worst-case total task routing delay from the source mobile devices to the matching target mobile devices under an uncertain probability distribution. Taking into account the unpredictable vehicle movement and discontinuous connection between vehicles and mobile devices, the indeterminate offloading and downloading from automobiles to satellites and mobile devices, respectively, are captured by the Wasserstein ambiguity set. Then, we are able to determine the optimal route for task uploading, routing throughout the satellite constellation, and downloading. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model has a lower and more robust latency than that of robust optimization (RO) strategy.

AB The adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is transforming the landscape of energy consumption. While the technical and economic dimensions of EV adoption are increasingly well understood, the aspect of justice in demand flexibility remains underexplored. This study examines the complex relationship between flexibility in EV charging behaviors and the influence of socio-psychological and justice factors. We explore a range of demographic and social-psychological variables including charging anxiety, environmental concerns, perceived cost-saving perception, perceived privacy, and trust in utility providers. Our results reveal that these variables positively influence the changes in charging habits, including time-shifting and load-reduction. This study also uncovers disparities in charging behavior adjustments across various demographics groups. For instance, White respondents are more likely to charge their EVs during off-peak hours than their non-White counterparts and homeowners show a greater intention to reduce EV charging load during peak hours compared to renters. Additionally, high-income individuals exhibit a stronger willingness to shift charging times to off-peak, with White respondents within the high-income group being the most likely to reduce the amount of charging load during peak hours. Conversely, low-income White respondents are less inclined to make such adjustments. These disparities are likely tied to socioeconomic status, as more vulnerable groups often face greater constraints in adjusting their schedules. Therefore, it is imperative that policies prioritize flexibility justice by addressing the specific needs and behaviors of vulnerable groups, aiming to mitigate the additional burdens resulting from their limited flexibility.

AB Network analysis has become a well-recognized methodology in physics education research (PER), with study topics including student performance and persistence, faculty change, and the structure of conceptual networks. The social network analysis side of this work has focused on quantitative analysis of wholenetwork cases, such as the structure of networks in single classrooms. Egocentric or personal network approaches are largely unexplored, and qualitative methods are underdeveloped. In this paper, we outline theoretical and practical differences between two major network paradigms-whole-network and egocentric-and introduce theoretical frameworks and methodological considerations for egocentric studies. We also describe qualitative and mixed-methods approaches that are currently missing from the PER literature. We identify areas where these additional network methods may be of particular interest to physics education researchers and end by discussing example cases and implications for new PER studies.

AB Heteroanionic compounds, which host two or more different anions, have emerged as a huge family of functional materials. Different from polyanionic compounds, there is no direct connection between anions within heteroanionic compounds. The connectivity between anions and central atoms constitutes various distorted basic building units (BBUs). The linkage between BBUs further promotes the structural flexibility of heteroanionic compounds. The diverse bonding modes of anion-metal interactions, which originate from the various physical and chemical properties of anions, explain the existence of many important applications of heteroanionic compounds. In this short review, we summarize the synthesis, structures, and physical applications of selected heteroanionic compounds. From a synthesis perspective, a deep understanding of crystal growth mechanisms and a better controlled growth process should be emphasized in future research. The interactions between distinct anions and other featured elements such as elements with lone electron pairs, d0 and d10 transition metals, etc., or other systems such as high entropy systems would further promote more interesting applications. Heteroanionic compounds that exhibit comparable structural features with known multiferroics might be new frameworks for discovering multiferroics. Machine learning and quickly developed calculation capabilities can also aid the study of heteroanionic compounds by understanding growth mechanisms, searching for new compounds, and targeting specific properties.
   This review briefly summarizes the chemical flexibility and physical properties of heteroanionic compounds and their potential applications as multiferroics.

AB Public genomic datasets like the 1000 Genomes project (1KGP), Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP), and the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study are valuable public resources that facilitate scientific advancements in biology and enhance the scientific and economic impact of federally funded research projects. Regrettably, these datasets have often been developed and studied in ways that propagate outdated racialized and typological thinking, leading to fallacious reasoning among some readers that social and health disparities among the so-called races are due in part to innate biological differences between them. We highlight how this framing has set the stage for the racist exploitation of these datasets in two ways: First, we discuss the use of public biomedical datasets in studies that claim support for innate genetic differences in intelligence and other social outcomes between the groups identified as races. We further highlight recent instances of this which involve unauthorized access, use, and dissemination of public datasets. Second, we discuss the memification, use of simple figures meant for quick dissemination among lay audiences, of population genetic data to argue for a biological basis for purported human racial groups. We close with recommendations for scientists, to preempt the exploitation and misuse of their data, and for funding agencies, to better enforce violations of data use agreements.

ID AWARENESS
AB Serious games have long been used in domains like defense, management, finance, and environmental protection to improve plans and procedures. In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, public health and emergency management organizations are beginning to use such games to enhance their preparedness and readiness activities. In this paper, we present a Knowledge Acquisition Analytical Game (K2AG) focused on understanding and providing training for command, control, coordination, and communication (C3C) functions during an infectious disease outbreak. Unlike traditional game-based exercises, which target strategic, operational and tactical decision making, the K2AG games focus on the cognitive level at which decision-making under uncertainty takes place. Specifically, the C3C Game collects data reflecting the cognitive processes by which players gain situational awareness, make decisions, and take actions. The C3C Game was created through a community-centered design process and leverages methods from human factor engineering, including hierarchical task analysis. This paper describes the game, presents results from a pilot exercise conducting with public health and emergency response decision makers from a large US metropolitan area, and discusses the potential for such games to improve pandemic preparedness and resilience.

AB Predicting the properties of molecular crystals is imperative to the field of materials design. In lieu of alternative methods, advances in machine learning have made it possible to predict the properties of materials before synthesis. This is especially important for organic semiconductors (OSCs) that are prone to exhibit polymorphism, as this phenomenom can impact the properties of a system, including the bandgap in OSCs. While graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise in predicting the bandgap in OSCs, few studies have considered the impact of polymorphism on their performance. Using the MatDeepLearn framework, we examine five different graph convolution layers of ALIGNN, GATGNN, CGCNN, MEGNet, and SchNet, which all have graph convolutions implemented in torch geometric. A dataset of functional organic molecular crystals is extracted from the OCELOT database, which has calculated density functional theory (DFT) values for the bandgap as well as several sets of polymorphs. The trained models are then evaluated on several test cases including the polymorphs of ROY. In future work we plan to examine the impact of graph representations on the performance of these models in the case of predicting properties of polymorphic OSCs.

AB Permanent magnet materials based on Mn demonstrate high potential to fill the gap between lower-performance bonded ferrites and high-performance magnets based on rare-earth elements. Mn-Al permanent magnets were processed into bulk via the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) technique. Gas-atomized Mn54Al46 precursor particulates were fused into cube-shaped magnets of the high-temperature epsilon phase with similar to 93 % bulk density. A 450 degrees C anneal for 30 min transformed the epsilon phase into largely the ferromagnetic tau phase. The magnetic properties were compared to an as-cast reference bulk Mn54Al46 sample prepared from epsilon phase via the same heat treatment. The LPBF sample exhibited a finer grain size, a similar to 45 % gain in coercivity, and higher remanence due to grain elongation and a weak <001>(tau) texture parallel to the printing direction. Despite the loss of density, the LPBF sample had a similar to 70 % improvement in (BH)(max) compared to the as-cast bulk reference sample. The success of this process demonstrates that the LPBF technique is a viable method to densify the metastable Mn-Al tau phase from particulate into bulk while retaining a fine grain size, developing magnetic anisotropy, and preventing phase decomposition. Optimal properties of the LPBF magnet were M-r = 41 Am-2/kg, H-ci = 129 kA/m, and (BH)(max) = 7.2 kJ/m(3) along the print direction.

AB The effect of inert gas on melt pool dynamics has been largely overlooked but is crucial for laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). Physics-based simulation models are computationally expensive while data-driven models lack transpar-ency and need massive training data. This work presents a physics-informed deep learning (PIDL) model to accu-rately predict the temperature and velocity fields in the melting domain using only a small training data. The PIDL model can also learn unknown model constants (e.g., Reynolds number and Peclet number) of the governing equa-tions. Furthermore, the robust PIDL algorithm converges very fast by enforcing physics via soft penalty constraints.& COPY; 2023 CIRP. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In spite of the sudden onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, many instructors who used team-based pedagogies shifted them online rather than suspending them entirely, but with limited time and resources. To examine the difference in team dynamics and outcomes for courses in Spring 2019 and Spring 2020 of over 1500 first-year engineering students per semester, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and random forests method were used. Results show that students reported less improvement in team-member effectiveness, lower psychological safety, and less satisfaction in the semester with the emergency transition. However, students also reported lower conflict. The most important factor predicting project grades shifted from 'Interacting with teammates' to 'Having relevant knowledge, skills, and abilities' amid the emergency shift, accompanied by a reduction in team interdependence. In spite of the collection of data during an emergency transition, the foundation of face-to-face interaction before moving to virtual cooperation represents a useful contribution to research that has focused exclusively on virtual learning circumstances.

TI ARKGraph: All-Range Approximate K-Nearest-Neighbor Graph
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE VLDB ENDOWMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID PRODUCT QUANTIZATION; SMALL WORLD; SEARCH; LOCALITY
AB Given a collection of vectors, the approximate K-nearest-neighbor graph (KGraph for short) connects every vector to its approximate K-nearest-neighbors (KNN for short). KGraph plays an important role in high dimensional data visualization, semantic search, manifold learning, and machine learning. The vectors are typically vector representations of real-world objects (e.g., images and documents), which often come with a few structured attributes, such as timestamps and locations. In this paper, we study the all-range approximate K-nearest-neighbor graph (ARKGraph) problem. Specifically, given a collection of vectors, each associated with a numerical search key (e.g., a timestamp), we aim to build an index that takes a search key range as the query and returns the KGraph of vectors whose search keys are within the query range. ARKGraph can facilitate interactive high dimensional data visualization, data mining, etc. A key challenge of this problem is the huge index size. This is because, given.. vectors, a brute-force index stores a KGraph for every search key range, which results in O(Kn(3)) index size as there are O(n(2)) search key ranges and each KGraph takes O(Kn) space. We observe that the KNN of a vector in nearby ranges are often the same, which can be grouped together to save space. Based on this observation, we propose a series of novel techniques that reduce the index size significantly to just O(Kn logn) in the average case. Furthermore, we develop an efficient indexing algorithm that constructs the optimized ARKGraph index directly without exhaustively calculating the distance between every pair of vectors. To process a query, for each vector in the query range, we only need O(log log n + K log K) to restore its KNN in the query range from the optimized ARKGraph index. We conducted extensive experiments on real-world datasets. Experimental results show that our optimized ARKGraph index achieved a small index size, low query latency, and good scalability. Specifically, our approach was 1000x faster than the baseline method that builds a KGraph for all the vectors in the query range on-the-fly.

AB Additive manufacturing has become increasingly popular and is opening doors for increased collaboration, quick manufacturing turnaround times, and rapid prototyping. New collaboration opportunities are enabled by 3D model databases that help users find, modify and manufacture parts upon request. Nevertheless, the current process relies heavily on user-defined text-based labels to describe and identify parts, yet user tagging is an expensive and laborious process. To address the limitations of traditional tag-based methods, this work proposes new shape-based search techniques that bring significant usability improvements over the current state of the art. In particular, our approach allows users to query for parts at different stages of the manufacturing process, including approximate models, GCode printer files, and real world objects. At the core of our technique is a generative adversarial network that flattens 3D shapes into depth-based 2.5D images, which are then cataloged and queried based on a frequency-domain representation and a locality-sensitive hashing scheme. We evaluate our methodology using a rich dataset of everyday objects, and our evaluation results report a high accuracy retrieval rate for our test set.

AB Quantization is an effective technique for reducing the number of computations and improving the performance of deep neural networks (DNNs). Weight quantization is popular because weights can be trained beforehand. However, weight quantization only targets the kernel weights and ignores the sensitivity of input features, which can lead to reduced accuracy. Fine-grained input quantization has gained attention as a way to speed up DNNs while maintaining accuracy. Existing approaches determine computation precision based on input sensitivity but do not effectively reduce computations for insensitive outputs or retain the precision of sensitive outputs. These limitations motivate us to develop an output-directed dynamic quantization method named ODQ in this paper. ODQ is a two-stage DNN quantization scheme designed to improve performance, reduce energy consumption, and maintain and often improve accuracy, compared with existing quantization methods. Specifically, inputs and weights go through sensitivity prediction and result generation. The high-order 2 bits of input and weight are used to predict output sensitivity. Result generation is performed only for predicted sensitive outputs. We designed an FPGA accelerator to optimize ODQ quantization performance for DNNs. We implement a prototype of ODQ and evaluate its performance using several state-of-the-art DNNs. Compared with a state-of-the-art input-directed quantization approach, ODQ achieves a 67.6% performance speedup and a 66.9% energy saving, with minimal accuracy degradation (<= 0.6%).

AB Digital equity in Internet access is often measured along three axes: availability, affordability, and adoption. Most prior work focuses on availability; the other two aspects have received less attention. In this paper, we study broadband affordability in the US by focusing on the nature of broadband plans offered by major ISPs. To this end, we develop a broadband plan querying tool (BQT) that obtains broadband plans (upload/download speed and price) offered by seven major wireline US ISPs for any street address in the US. We then use this tool to curate a dataset, querying broadband plans for over 837 k street addresses in thirty cities for these ISPs. We use a plan's carriage value, defined as the Mbps of a user's traffic that an ISP carries for one dollar, to compare plans. Our analysis provides us with the following new insights: (1) ISP plans vary inter-city. Specifically, up to 60% of the census block groups in a city can receive low carriage value plans from an ISP; (2) ISP plans intra-city are spatially clustered, and the carriage value can vary as much as 600% within a city; (3) Cable-based ISPs offer up to 30% higher carriage value to users when they are competing with fiber-based ISPs in a block group compared to when they are operating alone or in conjunction with a DSL-based ISP; and (4) Fiber deployments, which have better carriage values, are associated with higher average income block groups. While we hope our tool, dataset, and analysis in their current form are helpful for policymakers at different levels (city, county, state), they are only a small step toward quantifying digital inequity. We conclude with recommendations to further advance our understanding of broadband affordability.

AB Compared to traditional subtractive manufacturing processes, powder bed fusion (PBF) shows promise for making complex metal parts with design freedom, short development time, and environmental sustain -ability. However, there is a consensus within the additive manufacturing (AM) community that the random geometrical defects (e.g., porosity, lack-of-fusion) produced in PBF processes pose a great challenge to fabricating load-bearing parts, particularly under dynamic loading conditions. Therefore, it is imperative to quantify defect sizes and distributions to predict the critical, life-limiting defect size that significantly re-duces fatigue life. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the defects induced by selective laser melting to quantify their sizes and statistical distributions. Then four cumulative distribution functions (i.e., Weibull, Gamma, Gumbel, and Lognormal CDFs) are leveraged and compared to predict the maximum defect size based on the principle of statistics of extremes. Both the peak over threshold (POT) approach and the block maxima (BM) approach are used for these predictions. The results show that the BM approach -based predictions for all CDFs to be much larger than the measured maxima while the POT approach-based predictions have less deviation. The Weibull and Gamma CDFs were best correlated to the data, measured by Pearson's R correlation coefficient, while the Gumbel and Lognormal CDFs were also well correlated.(c) 2022 CIRP.

Although an NHC adduct with [AlA '(3)] did not form, [(IDipp)AlCl(2)A '] and [(IMes)AlClA '(2)] were obtained and X-ray crystallography confirmed their construction around Al in a distorted tetrahedral environment. The [(NHC)AlCl(3-n)A ' n] complexes, [AlA '(3)], and [Al(OiPr)(3)] (as a reference) were examined for their ability to polymerize L-lactide via ring-opening polymerization to produce polylactide. All of them did so with varying degrees of effectiveness. Of the organoaluminum species, the [(NHC)AlCl3] complexes were very weak initiators, and [AlA '(3)] the most effective, producing polymer molecular weights up to 49 kDa (M-w), with the mixed chloro/allyl complexes in between. All initiators were slower than [Al((OPr)-Pr-i)(3)].

AB Chemical gradients, the spatial variations in chemical concentrations and components, are omnipresent in environments ranging from biological and environmental systems to industrial processes. These thermodynamic forces often play a central role in driving transport processes taking place in such systems. This review focuses on diffusiophoresis, a phoretic transport phenomenon driven by chemical gradients. We begin by revisiting the fundamental physicochemical hydrodynamics governing the transport. Then we discuss diffusiophoresis arising in flow systems found in natural and artificial settings. By exploring various scenarios where chemical gradients are encountered and exploited, we aim to demonstrate the significance of diffusiophoresis and its state-of-the-art development in technological applications.

AB In an effort to develop hypoxia-active iridium(III) complexes with long visible-light absorption, we synthesized and characterized five bis(terpyridine) Ir(III) complexes bearing oligothienyl substituents on one of the terpyridine ligands, i.e., n T-Ir (n = 0-4). The UV-vis absorption, emission, and transient absorption spectroscopy were employed to characterize the singlet and triplet excited states of these complexes and to explore the effects of varied number of thienyl units on the photophysical parameters of the complexes. In vitro photodynamic therapeutic activities of these complexes were assessed with respect to three melanoma cell lines (SKMEL28, A375, and B16F10) and two breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7) under normoxia (similar to 18.5% oxygen tension) and hypoxia (1% oxygen tension) upon broadband visible (400-700 nm), blue (453 nm), green (523 nm), and red (633 nm) light activation. It was revealed that the increased number of thienyl units bathochromically shifted the low-energy absorption bands to the green/orange spectral regions and the emission bands to the near-infrared (NIR) regions. The lowest triplet excited-state lifetimes and the singlet oxygen generation efficiency also increased from 0T to 2T substitution but decreased in 3T and 4T substitution. All complexes exhibited low dark cytotoxicity toward all cell lines, but 2T-Ir-4T-Ir manifested high photocytotoxicity for all cell lines upon visible, blue, and green light activation under normoxia, with 2T-Ir showing the strongest photocytotoxicity toward SKMEL28, MDA-MB-231, and MCF-7 cells, and 4T-Ir being the most photocytotoxic one for B16F10 and A375 cells. Singlet oxygen, superoxide anion radicals, and peroxynitrite anions were found to likely be involved in the photocytotoxicity exhibited by the complexes. 4T-Ir also showed strong photocytotoxicity upon red-light excitation toward all cell lines under normoxia and retained its photocytotoxicity under hypoxia toward all cell lines upon visible, blue, and green light excitation. The hypoxic activity of 4T-Ir along with its green to orange light absorption, NIR emission, and low dark cytotoxicity suggest its potential as a photosensitizer for photodynamic therapy applications.

AB Lignocellulosic biomass remains underutilized despite its annual production in gigaton quantities. Sulfur is another vastly underutilized waste product of fossil fuel refining. New mechanistic insight into the reactions of sulfur unveiled since 2020 suggest a rich and hitherto unexplored chemistry between biomass-derived olefins and elemental sulfur. In this study, four biomass-derived olefins (eugenol (1), 4-allyl-2,6-dimethoxyphenol (2), o-eugenol (3), and 2-allyl-6-methylphenol (4)) were reacted with elemental sulfur to elucidate the S-C bond-forming and other reactivity of these compounds. Each of the compounds was reacted with elemental sulfur in three sulfur : organic reactant ratios (2 : 1, 4 : 1 and 9 : 1) and at two temperatures (180 degrees C or 230 degrees C). Product mixtures were characterized using 1H NMR spectrometry and GC-MS analysis. Products resulting from a range of mechanisms were unveiled, including inverse vulcanization, S-Callylic/benzylic bond formation, S-Caryl bond formation, intramolecular cyclization, C-C sigma-bond scission, and C-O sigma-bond scission. It is anticipated that the insights from this study will support further synergy between the critical sustainability goals of biomass and sulfur utilization.

AB While much of the transgender health literature has focused on poor health outcomes, less research has examined how trans people find reliable information on, and actually go about accessing, gender-affirming healthcare. Through qualitative interviews with creators of trans technologies, that is, technologies designed to address problems that trans people face, we found that digital technologies have become important tools for proliferating access to gender-affirming care and related health information. We found that technologists often employed different processes for creating their technologies, but they coalesced around the goal of enabling and increasing access to gender-affirming care. Creators of trans health technologies also encountered precarious conditions for creating and maintaining their technologies, including regional gaps left by national resources focused on the US east and west coasts. Findings demonstrated that trans tech creators were motivated to create and maintain these technologies as a means of caring for one another and forming trans communities in spite of the precarious conditions trans people face living under systemic oppression.

AB With the rise of sophisticated cyberattacks, the efficiency of intrusion detection systems becomes paramount. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models used for intrusion detection often encounter datasets with irrelevant or redundant features, leading to low performance. To address this challenge, feature engineering techniques are important in extracting the most informative features, enabling faster and more accurate detection of malicious patterns. This paper investigates a comparative analysis of four feature engineering methods using a historical archival dataset: entropy, mutual information, chi-squared statistics, and ANOVA. By evaluating and comparing the effectiveness of these methods under different conditions of ML/DL models, this study aims to provide insights into their respective strengths and weaknesses, guiding the selection of the most suitable approach to improve the efficiency of network intrusion detection systems.

AB Generative probabilistic forecasting produces future time series samples according to the conditional probability distribution given past time series observations. Such techniques are essential in risk-based decision-making and planning under uncertainty with broad applications in grid operations, including electricity price forecasting, risk-based economic dispatch, and stochastic optimizations. Inspired by Wiener and Kallianpur's innovation representation, we propose a weak innovation autoencoder architecture and a learning algorithm to extract independent and identically distributed innovation sequences from nonparametric stationary time series. We show that the weak innovation sequence is Bayesian sufficient, which makes the proposed weak innovation autoencoder a canonical architecture for generative probabilistic forecasting. The proposed technique is applied to forecasting highly volatile real-time electricity prices, demonstrating superior performance across multiple forecasting measures over leading probabilistic and point forecasting techniques.

ID ELEMENTAL SULFUR; COPOLYMERIZATION
AB The preparation of sulfur containing polymers from inexpensive, commodity sulfur base chemicals is an emerging field of polymer chemistry as a route to consume elemental sulfur generated from fossil fuel refining. Recently a new process, termed, sulfenyl chloride inverse vulcanization has been developed that exploits the high reactivity and miscibility of sulfur monochloride, (S2Cl2) with a broad range of allylic monomers to prepare soluble, high molar mass linear polymers, segmented block copolymers and crosslinked thermosets with greater synthetic precision than achieved using classical inverse vulcanization with elemental sulfur. However, the ring-opening of episulfonium intermediates from this polymerization can proceed via Markovnikov, anti-Markovnikov, or alternative pathways resulting in complex regioisomeric microstructures, particularly when used with allylic ester monomers. Hence, to accelerate structural characterization of this new class of poly-halodisulfides prepared by the sulfenyl chloride inverse vulcanization process, we report on a detailed structural characterization to quantify the molar composition of regioisomeric units in these materials using NMR spec-troscopy, focusing on sulfenyl chloride additions to allylic benzoate substrates. We report on a general meth-odology using one-and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopic techniques to enable direct integration of 2D NMR spectroscopic cross peaks to quantify the molar composition of regioisomeric units in 1,3-diallyl isophthalate (DAI) polymerized with S2Cl2, along with detailed studies on model compound reactions to detail the analytical methodology.

AB The proper formation of the vertebrate embryonic heart relies on various mechanical forces which determine its form and function. Measuring these forces at the microscale of the embryo is a challenge. We propose a new tool utilizing high-resolution optical elastography and stiffness measurements of surrounding tissues to non-invasively track the changes in the pressure exerted by the heart on the neighboring yolk, as well as changes in contractile patterns during early cardiac growth in-vivo, using the zebrafish embryo as a model system. Cardiac development was characterized every three hours from 24 hours post-fertilization (hpf) to 30 hpf and compared between wildtype fish and those treated with MS-222, a commonly used fish anesthetic that decreases cardiac contractility. Wildtype embryos from 24 to 30 hpf showed an average yolk indentation pressure of 0.32 mmHg to 0.41 mmHg, respectively. MS-222 treated embryos showed an average yolk indentation pressure of 0.22 mmHg to 0.29 mmHg. Yolk indentation pressure between control and treated embryos at 24 hpf and 30 hpf showed a significant difference (p < 0.05). Our method allowed for contractility and pressure evaluation at these early developmental stages, which have not been previously reported in published literature, regardless of sample or imaging modality. This research could lead to a better understanding of heart development and improved diagnostic tools for congenital heart disease.

AB Bottlebrush polymers (BBPs) of different architecture are of considerable interest for a broad range of applications, including nanomedicine, electronics, and self-healing materials. Using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate and compare the structural and hydration properties of cyclic and linear poly(vinyl alcohol)-graft-poly(ethylene oxide) (PVA-g-PEONsc) BBPs in aqueous solution as functions of PEO side-chain length, Nsc. We find that overall cyclic BBPs are smaller than the corresponding linear BBPs and their shape changes from donutlike to disklike to starlike with increasing side-chain length, while linear BBPs vary in shape from an expanded coil to a rod/cylinder. The radius of gyration of cyclic BBPs increases with an increase of the side-chain length at a somewhat slower rate than the linear BBPs but follows the same scaling Rg Nsc0.58 in the limit of long side chains. For short grafts, we determine that the persistence length, lp, for both cyclic and linear BBPs increases in a similar manner following an lp Nsc0.54 dependence. In the long side-chain limit, the persistence length (lp) of cyclic BBP saturates, while for linear BBPs lp strongly increases following the expected scaling relation lp Nsc15/8. We propose a scaling model that shows that the fraction of side-chains located inside the cyclic BBPs depends on the radius of the backbone ring and significantly decreases with an increase of graft length. For both cyclic and linear BBPs, the hydrogen bonding between PEO side chains and water is somewhat reduced near the backbone, where local chain stretching is observed, while reaching full hydration on the periphery. Overall, the hydration shell within 1 nm of the cyclic BBP backbone is found to be more dynamically stable compared to linear BBPs.

AB This work develops new results for stochastic approximation algorithms. The emphases are on treating algorithms and limits with discontinuities. The main ingredients include the use of differential inclusions, set-valued analy-sis, nonsmooth analysis, and stochastic differential inclusions. Under broad conditions, it is shown that a suitably scaled sequence of the iterates has a differential inclusion limit. In addition, it is shown for the first time that a centered and scaled sequence of the iterates converges weakly to a stochastic differential inclusion limit. The results are then used to treat several appli-cation examples including Markov decision processes, Lasso algorithms, Pe-gasos algorithms, support vector machine classification, and learning. Some numerical demonstrations are also provided.

AB In the evolving landscape of vehicular technology, autonomous and connected features lead to heightened connectivity among vehicles, intelligent devices, and infrastructures, broadening the vulnerability to cyber-attacks within the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) systems. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) leverage Machine Learning (ML) to detect these malicious intrusions, but they face challenges from data poisoning attacks, given the critical role of training data in threat modeling. The vulnerability of training data emerges as a significant threat vector during ML model training. This study introduces a hash function-enabled ensemble ML training framework tailored for IDS, mitigating data poisoning attacks during model training. We test and validate our framework using hash-enabled ensemble ML algorithms-including random forests, support vector machines, and decision trees-on the benchmark CICIDS 2017 dataset. Results demonstrate that the hash-enabled random forests model guarantees a misclassification rate below 0.5%

AB Dental caries is one of the most common diseases globally. It affects children and adults living in poverty, who have the most limited access to dental care. Left unexamined and untreated in the early stages, treatments for late-stage and severe caries are costly and unaffordable for socioeconomically disadvantaged families. If detected early, caries can be reversed to avoid more severe outcomes and a tremendous financial burden on the dental care system. Building upon a dataset of 50,179 intraoral tooth photos taken by various modalities, including smartphones and intraoral cameras, the present study developed a multi-stage deep learning-based pipeline of artificial intelligence algorithms that localize individual teeth and classify each tooth into several classes of caries. This study initially tem (ICDAS) scores to each tooth and subsequently grouped caries into two levels: level 1 for white spots (ICDAS 1 and 2) and level 2 for cavitated lesions (ICDAS 3 to 6). The system's performance was assessed across a broad spectrum of anterior and posterior teeth photographs. For anterior teeth, 89.78% sensitivity and 91.67% specificity for level 1 (white spots) and 97.06% sensitivity and 99.79% specificity for level 2 (cavitated lesions) were achieved, respectively. For the more challenging posterior teeth due to the higher variability in the location of white spots, 90.25% sensitivity and 86.96% specificity for level 1 and 95.8% sensitivity and 94.12% specificity for level 2 were achieved, respectively. The performance of the devel- oped Al algorithms shows potential as a cost-effective tool for early caries detection in nonclinical settings.

AB Increasing electrode thickness is a key strategy to boost energy density in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), which is essential for electric vehicles and energy storage applications. However, thick electrodes face significant challenges, including poor ion transport, long diffusion paths, and mechanical instability, all of which degrade battery performance. To overcome these barriers, a novel micro-electric-field (mu-EF) process is introduced that enhances particle alignment during fabrication with reduced distance between anode and cathode. This process produces hyper-thick (approximate to 700 mu m) electrodes with low tortuosity and improved ion diffusion. The mu-EF electrodes achieve high areal capacities (approximate to 8 mAh cm-2), while maintaining power density and long cycle life. The electrodes show stable performance under high C-rate cycling and retain structural integrity after 1000 cycles at 2 C. By offering a scalable solution to the challenges of thick electrode fabrication, the mu-EF process represents a significant advancement for high-capacity LIBs in electric vehicles and energy storage systems.

AB Reusing massive collections of publicly available biomedical data can significantly impact knowledge discovery. However, these public samples and studies are typically described using unstructured plain text, hindering the findability and further reuse of the data. To combat this problem, we propose txt2onto 2.0, a general-purpose method based on natural language processing and machine learning for annotating biomedical unstructured metadata to controlled vocabularies of diseases and tissues. Compared to the previous version (txt2onto 1.0), which uses numerical embeddings as features, this new version uses words as features, resulting in improved interpretability and performance, especially when few positive training instances are available. Txt2onto 2.0 uses embeddings from a large language model during prediction to deal with unseen-yet-relevant words related to each disease and tissue term being predicted from the input text, thereby explaining the basis of every annotation. We demonstrate the generalizability of txt2onto 2.0 by accurately predicting disease annotations for studies from independent datasets, using proteomics and clinical trials as examples. Overall, our approach can annotate biomedical text regardless of experimental types or sources. Code, data, and trained models are available at https://github.com/krishnanlab/txt2onto2.0.

AB In the presence of a magnetic field, a liquid crystal (LC) director can be distorted from a ground state set by a combination of LC elasticity and surface anchoring at any relevant interfaces. Uniform magnetic fields are often used to produce simple LC distortions on demand, but producing more spatially complex distortions is practically challenging. We develop a strategy for the spatially resolved control of the LC director by leveraging field patterns induced by ferromagnetic materials. Patterned magnetic fields are generated from high-permeability ferromagnetic microstructures embedded into nematic liquid crystals (NLCs) to manipulate the LC director's orientation. Each ferromagnetic microstructure produces a unique spatially varying magnetic field. In turn, tuning magnetic field strength in competition with NLC elasticity can pattern a range of spatially complex director configurations. Simulations relate the spatial variation induced in a magnetic field by a ferromagnetic geometry and the resultant director. Our predictive models can inform the inverse design of ferromagnetic microstructures to generate bespoke director patterns. We also link changes in the magnetic field to the migration of elastically driven periodic extinctions in birefringence near the edges of ferromagnetic structures.

ID DEEP LEARNING CLASSIFICATION
AB Data-driven machine learning techniques have been advocated for signal detection in complex wireless environments. However, when applied to wideband spectrum sensing scenarios, they face practical challenges including very large data dimensionality, insufficient training data, and implicit inter-band dependencies. Current literature focuses on deep convolutional models, whose inherent model structure is not well suited for representing the diverse spectrum occupancy patterns of practical wideband networks, causing inefficient performance-complexity tradeoff and excessive sensing time. To address these issues, this paper develops a novel Spectrum Transformer with multi-task learning for wideband spectrum sensing at high sample efficiency. Empowered by the multi-head self-attention mechanism, the transformer architecture is designed to effectively learn both the inner-band spectral features and the inter-band spectrum occupancy correlations in the wideband regime. Simulations show that the proposed Spectrum Transformer outperforms the existing methods based on convolutional neural networks especially in the small-data case, by achieving higher sensing accuracy with an 89% reduction in model complexity.

AB Metallic glass matrix composites (MGMCs) represent a promising avenue for enhancing the ductility of monolithic metallic glass. These composites utilize a secondary crystalline phase to aid in the delocalization of strain. This work seeks to understand the mechanisms underlying strain delocalization in MGMCs to guide further advancements in this class of material. Employing a mesoscale shear transformation zone (STZ) dynamics model, we investigate how variation in dendritic microstructural sizes and spacings impact the shear banding behaviors of MGMCs subjected to uniaxial tensile loading. Statistical analysis of shear banding characteristics reveals that the competition of shear band nucleation and propagation rates can encourage strain delocalization in MGMCs. The introduction of a crystalline dendritic structure into the amorphous matrix increases the number of shear band nucleation events while reducing shear band propagation rates. Furthermore, reducing dendrite sizes leads to greater strain delocalization among more shear bands and delays the onset of run-away shear bands, resulting in lower overall shear band growth rates. Therefore, this study sheds light on the crucial role of dendritic microstructural sizes in influencing shear banding characteristics and strain delocalization in MGMCs, offering valuable insights to inform the design and development of advanced materials with superior mechanical properties.

AB Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are endopeptidases, and their activity depends on calcium and zinc metal ions. These enzymes are expressed originally in zymogenic form, where the active site of proteins is closed by a prodomain which is removed during activation. A homeostatic balance of their activity is primarily regulated by a 'cysteine switch' located on a consensus sequence of the prodomain and natural endogenous inhibitors, called tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). Breakage of this homeostasis may lead to various pathological conditions, which may require further activation and/or inhibition of these enzymes to regenerate that balance. Here, we report four modulators, more specifically, three inhibitors ( I1, I2 and I3 ), and one exogenous activator (L) L ) of the active form of human collagenase MMP-1 (without prodomain). The results were confirmed by binding studies using fluorescence-based enzyme assays.

AB This letter proposes a compact, low-profile, and battery-free wireless sensor, capable of continuously monitoring spoilage gases, such as ammonia, in meat and seafood products. The wireless sensor consists of a high-Q microstrip antenna loaded with a varactor diode, whose capacitance is reconfigured by an electrochemical ammonia sensor such that the resonance frequency of the antenna can be tuned by ammonia levels. This (receiving) antenna sensor operating at the fundamental frequency f(0) is connected to a passive frequency doubler and a wideband monopole (transmitting) antenna operating at the second harmonic 2f(0). By receiving and retransmitting radio waves with orthogonal frequencies under the frequency-hopping spread spectrum framework, electromagnetic interferences, such as clutters and jamming, can be filtered out, thus ensuring robust wireless food sensing with absolute accuracy in noisy environments. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed sensor are demonstrated through remote monitoring of the spoilage process of packaged fish within 48 h. Our measurement results show that the ammonia concentration can be continuously monitored by tracking the peak frequency of the received strength signal indicator at harmonic frequencies. This passive and chipless radio frequency identification sensor with minimal footprint, low complexity, and low cost may be readily deployed into the food package/container for real-time assessment and forecasting of food quality and safety.

AB This article explores grogue, a sugarcane-based distilled spirit of Cabo Verde, and its multifaceted and contested valuations in culture, livelihoods, and well-being. Despite Cabo Verde's challenging climate, sugarcane agriculture remains significant primarily due to the importance placed on the local production of grogue. The study described in this article investigates how grogue is perceived and valued among Cabo Verdeans, questioning why it promotes connectivity, sustainable livelihoods, and identity as a cultural asset and how it is entangled in a complicated colonial legacy, harmful health and negative societal outcomes, and neoliberal designs to modernize and industrialize as a cultural liability. The researchers conducted a thematic analysis of news stories and their associated comments from A Semana, the premiere daily online Cabo Verdean newspaper, to explore grogue's production, distribution, consumption, regulation, and valuation. The findings demonstrate various value registers, including identity, place, economic development, health, and social well-being, all of which help shape Cabo Verdeans' perspectives on grogue. This article is a crucial starting point for future research aimed at developing a comprehensive understanding of artisanal spirits' proliferation and contested values. By investigating multivocal interests behind competing ideas of valuation or devaluation of grogue, the study contributes to understanding its impacts on Cabo Verdean society.

AB This work reports piloting data analysis of ROTEC's flow reversal RO (FRRO) at City of Santa Monica's Arcadia Water Treatment Plant. It is shown that periodic block rotation and feed flow reversal balance salt and foulant load and mitigate scaling formation, enabling a 90 % recovery with a typical CIP interval over 30 days. As membrane fouls, there is a decline in the specific flux and an increase in the specific pressure drop. Nevertheless, the last stage pressure is usually no more than 200 psi. The successful pilot led to the design and commissioning of the first FRRO full-scale municipal installation in the United States.

AB Buildings are responsible for the largest portion of energy consumption on US electric grids. The wide participation of buildings in demand side management (DSM) through modulating or shifting electricity end uses, particularly in homes, can support decarbonization goals and increase reliability of electric power supply. The awareness and willingness of households to adjust internal loads, housing occupancy, and household energy consumption patterns all play an important role to support the potential for DSM. A particularly challenging type of housing to reach in DSM is rental housing. Historically, this type of housing has been plagued by split incentives that limit the motivation of homeowners (landlords) to improve the energy performance of these buildings since they often do not pay the utility bills. DSM presents an opportunity to support reducing the utility bills of renters through control adjustments rather than requiring the landlord to invest in energy efficient technologies. This study aims to identify household occupancy schedules and potential factors that may influence willingness to participate in DSM among renters, in particular college students. A survey-based method was conducted among 55 college students majoring in civil, environmental, and applied engineering, and showed that, while the targeted population has low awareness about DSM strategies, they would be willing to participate in a DSM in the future. The factors that appear to drive willingness to participate in DSM for this population were related to the potential reduction of electricity costs and energy savings.

AB Serious games can be a valuable addition to the resources available for increasing community resilience in the face of disaster. The purpose of this project is to work closely with two communities at risk of wildfire to design and develop a serious game that can be used by experts and leaders within those communities as part of their holistic approach to increasing resilience and improving readiness of their community members. We follow a community-centric approach, utilizing Participatory Design and Research through Design to engage directly with community members and local experts. This paper documents our findings at two workshops involving the early game designs and contributes to the broader exploration of the use of Participatory Design with serious games in support of community initiatives around disaster preparedness.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB Decentralized Multi-agent Learning (DML) enables collaborative model training while preserving data privacy. However, inherent heterogeneity in agents' resources (computation, communication, and task size) may lead to substantial variations in training time. This heterogeneity creates a bottleneck, lengthening the overall training time due to straggler effects and potentially wasting spare resources of faster agents. To minimize training time in heterogeneous environments, we present a Communication-Efficient Training Workload Balancing for Decentralized Multi-Agent Learning (ComDML), which balances the workload among agents through a decentralized approach. Leveraging local-loss split training, ComDML enables parallel updates, where slower agents offload part of their workload to faster agents. To minimize the overall training time, ComDML optimizes the workload balancing by jointly considering the communication and computation capacities of agents, which hinges upon integer programming. A dynamic decentralized pairing scheduler is developed to efficiently pair agents and determine optimal offloading amounts. We prove that in ComDML, both slower and faster agents' models converge, for convex and non-convex functions. Furthermore, extensive experimental results on popular datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and CINIC-10) and their non-I.I.D. variants, with large models such as ResNet-56 and ResNet-110, demonstrate that ComDML can significantly reduce the overall training time while maintaining model accuracy, compared to state-of-the-art methods. ComDML demonstrates robustness in heterogeneous environments, and privacy measures can be seamlessly integrated for enhanced data protection.

AB The ongoing integration of Building Information Modelling (BIM) with robotic technologies is initiating a revolution in the construction industry; however, there is a lack of systematic reviews on the application of BIM-Robotics in the industry. This review paper provides a comprehensive analysis of this trend, assessing the workflow from BIM to robot operation. It includes discussions on the leaders in BIM-Robot, the applications of BIM-Robot integration, implications, and prospects. A systematic literature review using the PRISMA methodology was conducted via the Web of Science (WOS) database to achieve the objective. Initially, 200 articles were identified, but only 22 met the established criteria for selection. This research paper aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers, practitioners in the AEC industry, educators, industry professionals, and policymakers. It seeks to assist them in adapting to and leveraging these emerging technologies to address the challenges of the future construction industry. By extracting data from relevant articles, the paper investigates the current leaders in robot navigation using BIM in construction, and the state of research in employing BIM for robot navigation.

AB The functionality of load-bearing parts remains a central challenge for laser-powder bed fusion (L-PBF). However, the understanding and quantification of the process-quality-fatigue (P-Q-F) causal relationship are still lacking. The variable fatigue behavior is randomized by the PBF process variations and the subsequent quality uncertainty, e.g., random geometrical defects. In particular, the bulk literature is limited to gross fatigue fracture, while the fatigue initiation and development process is poorly understood due to the constraint of available online fatigue monitoring techniques. Addressing these challenges is critical to qualify L-PBF as a standard industrial process for fabricating load-bearing metal parts. From the scientific point of view, the effect of a wide range of porosity on fatigue performance is yet to be studied to understand the P-Q-F causal relationship even though low porosity more completely is desired in L-PBF parts. This work focuses on resonance-based fatigue testing of as-PBFed SS-316L material with random porosity. The results have shown that frequency and power are process signatures for fatigue initiation, development, and gross fracture. The porosity-induced fatigue life and fatigue limit scattering show normal distributions.

AB Environmental contamination with bisphenol A (BPA), produced via degradation of plastic waste, constitutes a major hazard for human health due to the ability of BPA to bind to estrogen receptors and thereby induce hormonal imbalances. Unfortunately, BPA cannot be degraded to a "safe" material without breaking C-C sigma-bonds, and existing methods required to break these bonds employ petroleum-derived chemicals and environmentally-harmful metal ions. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new "green" methods to break BPA into monoaryl compounds without the use of such reagents and, ideally, convert those monoaryls into valuable materials that can be productively utilized instead of being discarded as chemical waste. Herein we report a new mechanism by which O,O '-dimethyl bisphenol A (DMBPA), obtained from BPA-containing plastic via low-temperature recycling, undergoes C-C sigma-bond cleavage via thiocracking, a reaction with elemental sulfur at temperatures lower than those used in many thermal plastic recycling techniques (e.g., <325 degrees C). Mechanistic analyses and microstructural characterization of the DMBPA-derived materials produced by thiocracking elucidated multiple subunits comprising monoaryl species. Impressively, analyses of recoverable organics revealed that >95% of DMBPA had been broken down into monoaryl components. Furthermore, the DMBPA-sulfur composite produced by thiocracking (BC90) exhibited compressive strength (similar to 20 MPa) greater than those of typical Portland cements. Consequently, this new thiocracking method creates the ability to destroy the estrogen receptor-binding components of BPA wastes using greener techniques and, simultaneously, to produce a mechanically-robust composite material that represents a sustainable alternative to Portland cements.

AB Exploration of outer space sparked interest in Lunar in-situ construction, which shows great advantages in material availability, low cost, and ease of construction. In this work, different weight ratios of graphene were added to regolith powder to investigate their effects on the sintering process and the mechanical properties of the regolith powder. After mixing and compacting, the graphene-regolith composite was sintered under high temperatures to obtain the consolidated solids. The phase distribution and formation of the sintered solids were characterized using energy-dispersive X-ray and X-ray diffraction spectroscopy. The mechanical properties of the modified regolith were studied by the nano and micro-indentation experiments. The results revealed that the dispersion of graphene could not only construct a typical continuous 3D hybrid network structure but also improve the mechanical property of the sintered composite.

AB There has been rapid growth in biomedical literature, yet capturing the heterogeneity of the bibliographic information of these articles remains relatively understudied. Graph neural networks have gained popularity, however, they may not fully capture the information available in the PubMed database, a biomedical literature repository containing over 33 million articles. We introduce PubMed Graph Benchmark (PGB), a new benchmark dataset for evaluating heterogeneous graph representations. PGB is one of the largest heterogeneous networks to date and aggregates the rich metadata into a unified source including abstract, authors, citations, keywords, and the associated keyword hierarchy. The benchmark contains an evaluation task of 21 systematic review topics, an essential knowledge translation tool.

DE schema matching; constraint matching; semantic matching
AB Schema matching aims to establish the correspondence between the attributes of database schemas. It has been regarded as the most difficult and crucial stage in the development of many contemporary database and web semantic systems. Manual mapping is a lengthy and laborious process, yet a low-quality algorithmic matcher may cause more trouble. Moreover, the issue of data privacy in certain domains, such as healthcare, poses further challenges, as the use of instance-level data should be avoided to prevent the leakage of sensitive information. To address this issue, we propose CONSchema, a model that combines both the textual attribute description and constraints of the schemas to learn a better matcher. We also propose a new experimental setting to assess the practical performance of schema matching models. Our results on 6 benchmark datasets across various domains including healthcare and movies demonstrate the robustness of CONSchema.

AB A new computational methodology, termed 'PeleLM-FDF' is developed and utilised for high fidelity large eddy simulation (LES) of complex turbulent combustion systems. This methodology is constructed via a hybrid scheme combining the Eulerian PeleLM base flow solver with the Lagrangian Monte Carlo simulator of the filtered density function (FDF) for the subgrid scale reactive scalars. The resulting methodology is capable of simulating some of the most intricate physics of complex turbulence-combustion interactions. This is demonstrated by LES of a non-premixed CO/H-2 temporally evolving jet flame. The chemistry is modelled via a skeletal kinetics model, and the results are appraised via a posteriori comparisons against direct numerical simulation (DNS) data of the same flame. Excellent agreements are observed for the time evolution of various statistics of the thermo-chemical quantities, including the manifolds of the multi-scalar mixing. The new methodology is capable of capturing the complex phenomena of flame-extinction and re-ignition at a 1/512 of the computational cost of the DNS. The high fidelity and the computational affordability of the new PeleLM-FDF solver warrants its consideration for LES of practical turbulent combustion systems.

AB The field of GeoAI or Geospatial Artificial Intelligence has undergone rapid development since 2017. It has been widely applied to address environmental and social science problems, from understanding climate change to tracking the spread of infectious disease. A foundational task in advancing GeoAI research is the creation of open, benchmark datasets to train and evaluate the performance of GeoAI models. While a number of datasets have been published, very few have centered on the natural terrain and its landforms. To bridge this gulf, this paper introduces a first-of-its-kind benchmark dataset, GeoImageNet, which supports natural feature detection in a supervised machine-learning paradigm. A distinctive feature of this dataset is the fusion of multi-source data, including both remote sensing imagery and DEM in depicting spatial objects of interest. This multi-source dataset allows a GeoAI model to extract rich spatio-contextual information to gain stronger confidence in high-precision object detection and recognition. The image dataset is tested with a multi-source GeoAI extension against two well-known object detection models, Faster-RCNN and RetinaNet. The results demonstrate the robustness of the dataset in aiding GeoAI models to achieve convergence and the superiority of multi-source data in yielding much higher prediction accuracy than the commonly used single data source.

AB Based on statistical mechanics, a macroscopically homogeneous system, i.e., a single phase in the present context, is composed of many independent configurations that the system embraces. The macroscopical properties of the system are determined by the properties and statistical probabilities of those configurations with respect to external conditions. The volume of a single phase is thus the weighted sum of the volumes of all configurations. Consequently, the derivative of the volume to temperature of a single phase depends on both the derivatives of the volumes of every configuration to temperature and the derivatives of their statistical probabilities to temperature, with the latter introducing nonlinear emergent behaviors. It is shown that the derivative of the volume to the temperature of the single phase can be negative, i.e., negative thermal expansion, due to the symmetry-breaking non-ground-state configurations with smaller volumes than that of the ground-state configuration and the rapid increase of the statistical probabilities of the former, and negative thermal expansion can be predicted without fitting parameters from the zentropy theory that combines quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics with the free energy of each configuration predicted from quantum mechanics and the partition function of each configuration calculated from its free energy.

ID SCHOOL; SOCIALIZATION; STUDENTS
AB Mixture modeling is a latent variable (i.e., a variable that cannot be measured directly) approach to quantitatively represent unobserved subpopulations within an overall population. It includes a range of cross-sectional (such as latent class [LCA] or latent profile analysis) and longitudinal (such as latent transition analysis) analyses and is often referred to as a "person-centered" approach to quantitative data. This research methods paper describes one type of mixture modeling, LCA, and provides examples of how this method can be applied to discipline-based education research in biology and other science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines. This paper briefly introduces LCA, explores the affordances LCA provides for equity-focused STEM education research, highlights some of its limitations, and provides suggestions for researchers interested in exploring LCA as a method of analysis. We encourage discipline-based education researchers to consider how statistical analyses may conflict with their equity-minded research agendas while also introducing LCA as a method of leveraging the affordances of quantitative data to pursue research goals aligned with equity, inclusion, access, and justice agendas.

AB Mosquito-borne diseases continue to pose a great threat to global public health systems due to increased insecticide resistance and climate change. Accurate vector identification is crucial for effective control, yet it presents significant challenges. IDX - an automated computer vision-based device capable of capturing mosquito images and outputting mosquito species ID has been deployed globally resulting in algorithms currently capable of identifying 53 mosquito species. In this study, we evaluate deployed performance of the IDX mosquito species identification algorithms using data from partners in the Southeastern United States (SE US) and Papua New Guinea (PNG) in 2023 and 2024. This preliminary assessment indicates continued improvement of the IDX mosquito species identification algorithms over the study period for individual species as well as average regional accuracy with macro average recall improving from 55.3 % [Confidence Interval (CI) 48.9, 61.7] to 80.2 % [CI 77.3, 84.9] for SE US, and 84.1 % [CI 75.1, 93.1] to 93.6 % [CI 91.6, 95.6] for PNG using a CI of 90 %. This study underscores the importance of algorithm refinement and dataset expansion covering more species and regions to enhance identification systems thereby reducing the workload for human experts, addressing taxonomic expertise gaps, and improving vector control efforts.

AB Construction sites present significant potential safety hazards to the workers, with hand tools being a major source of injuries. This paper presents a Lightweight approach for Small Tools Detection (LSTD) method using a deep neural network for real-time detection of small construction tools. LSTD utilizes a lightweight backbone with Dynamic Feature Extraction, Accurate Separated Head, and Integrated Feature Fusion, reducing parameters by 73% and computations by 28% versus YOLOv5 while achieving 87.3% mean Average Precision (mAP) on challenging construction site datasets. Additional modules enhance detection recall and robustness to appearance variation and scale changes. Extensive experiments demonstrate LSTD's superior performance in misty conditions and illumination changes. With high accuracy in a compact 2.87 M parameter network, LSTD brings ubiquitous worker safety monitoring via edge devices closer to reality. The proposed model marks a significant advancement in improving safety in high-risk construction environments.

AB The advancement of traditional CPU architectures is seeing diminished returns due to the slowing of Moore's Law and end of Dennard Scaling. FPGA-based accelerators provide a new path forward for High-Performance Computing. Instead of being confined to Von Neumann architecture and instruction set architectures, reconfigurable hardware allows computational scientists to develop application-specific architectures that can be expressed with common software programming languages thanks to advances in High-Level Synthesis. Work has been done to provide more support to these devices in the HPC community to ease adoption. This includes work to provide MPI implementations that enable data transfers between FPGAs within a compute cluster. However, a standardized benchmarking suite that measures the performance of this functionality does not exist. In this paper, we propose an extension to the OSU-Micro-Benchmarks suite, OMB-FPGA, that enables measuring the performance of MPI point-to-point and collective communication between FPGAs and other communication endpoints.

DE Hispanic-Serving Institutions; Computer Science; Federal policy
AB Although traditionally underfunded and overlooked in federal, state, and local policy efforts, Hispanic- Serving Institutions (HSIs) play a central role in shaping the ecosystem of the nation's STEM workforce by preparing disproportionately high shares of Latinx, African American, and Native American STEM graduates [4]. Enrolling more than 25% Latinx students, HSIs can play a critical role in preparing Latinx communities to pursue computing fields and increasing the diversity of the computing workforce. Despite their documented success at producing racially minoritized STEM graduates, research about why HSIs and other MSIs are so effective at producing high shares of STEM and computing graduates is scant [4]. This paper integrates the perspectives of computer science education research, higher education organizational change, and research on HSIs to demonstrate their potential to shape participation and policy in computing and technology. It employs scholarship about a nationally funded alliance as a case study to illustrate how research can inform policy and support student success.

   agnostic; demographic agnostic
AB Much existing literature on fair recommendation (i.e., group fairness) leverages users' demographic attributes (e.g., gender) to develop fair recommendation methods. However, in real-world scenarios, due to privacy concerns and convenience considerations, users may not be willing to share their demographic information with the system, which limits the application of many existing methods. Moreover, sequential recommendation (SR) models achieve state-ofthe-art performance compared to traditional collaborative filtering (CF) recommenders, and can represent users solely using user-item interactions (user-free). This leaves a wrong impression that SR models are free from group unfairness by design. In this work, we explore a critical question: how can we build a fair sequential recommendation system without even knowing user demographics? To address this problem, we propose Agnostic FairSeqRec (A-FSR): a model-agnostic and demographic-agnostic debiasing framework for sequential recommendation without requiring users' demographic attributes. Firstly, A-FSR reduces the correlation between the potential stereotypical patterns in the input sequences and final recommendations via Dirichlet neighbor smoothing. Secondly, A-FSR estimates an under-represented group of sequences via a gradient-based heuristic, and implicitly moves training focus towards the under-represented group by minimizing a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) based objective. Results on real-world datasets show that A-FSR achieves significant improvements on group fairness in sequential recommendation, while outperforming other state-of-the-art baselines.

AB Sampling in multiple localities, coupled with molecular barcoding, has shown that nominal species with wide geographical distribution often harbour local cryptic species in allopatry. Cryptic species in sympatry, however, can be easily missed if they have different seasonality, because they can be identified only through long-term frequent sampling (i.e. sampling through time of the same species in the same location). This is especially true in planktonic invertebrates that exhibit strong seasonality. By integrating mitochondrial 16S sequences of eight species of Hydrozoa (Cnidaria) collected weekly for a year in one Gulf of Mexico region, with sequences gathered globally, we investigate the presence of cryptic species within a temporal gradient (regionally) and on a spatial (worldwide) scale. We find that eight species of Hydrozoa are composed of 28 cryptic species, with 16 of them appearing in sympatry but with non-overlapping seasonality. The high number of sympatric cryptic species could only be discovered through extensive and prolonged regional sampling efforts. The bi-dimensional cryptic diversity (in time and space) highlighted in this study is essential for understanding processes of evolution, biogeography dispersal in the sea, and for more realistic biodiversity assessments.

AB Improving the interpretability of geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) models has become critically important to open the 'black box' of complex AI models, such as deep learning. This paper compares popular saliency map generation techniques and their strengths and weaknesses in interpreting GeoAI and deep learning models' reasoning behaviors, particularly when applied to geospatial analysis and image processing tasks. We surveyed two broad classes of model explanation methods: perturbation-based and gradient-based methods. The former identifies important image areas, which help machines make predictions by modifying a localized area of the input image. The latter evaluates the contribution of every single pixel of the input image to the model's prediction results through gradient backpropagation. In this study, three algorithms-the occlusion method, the integrated gradients method, and the class activation map method-are examined for a natural feature detection task using deep learning. The algorithms' strengths and weaknesses are discussed, and the consistency between model-learned and human-understandable concepts for object recognition is also compared. The experiments used two GeoAI-ready datasets to demonstrate the generalizability of the research findings.

AB Recent progressions in federated learning (FL) have facilitated the development of decentralized collaborative Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. However, data-driven FL algorithms face the challenge of heterogeneity in participating IoT devices, including their deployment environment and calibration settings. Fail to follow these device-specific properties can degenerate the model performance. To address this issue, we present FedSTL in this poster abstract, which is a two-staged personalized FL framework with clustering for sequential prediction tasks in IoT. FedSTL first identifies client properties as Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications. Then, a partitioning component of FedSTL associates each client to an aggregation center, while the framework continues to infer properties for the cluster. At the training stage, both cluster and client models are encouraged to follow customized properties to achieve a hierarchical property enhancing strategy. Further, we show preliminary results of FedSTL in this poster abstract under a synthetic multitask IoT environment and a real-world traffic prediction scenario.

AB In this paper, we present PRECISE, a novel privacy preserving data sharing framework for connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs). PRECISE allows users to define the objects or parts that they wish to protect privacy before sharing data with other vehicles. It leverages secure segmentation and inpainting technologies to protect sensitive data of vehicles. PRECISE explores the edges to offload resource-intensive deep learning workloads. To ensure data privacy in the processing on edge, PRECISE leverages additive secret sharing theory to define secure functions for deep neural networks (DNNs). Two secure DNN models, Secure SegNet and Secure Context Encoder, are introduced, along with detailed explanations of how to develop secure CNN layers and the secure functions used in building these layers. We have implemented a prototype of PRECISE and evaluated its performance. The experimental results demonstrate that PRECISE is lightweight, achieving secure segmentation in 3.47 seconds and secure inpainting in 0.99 seconds. The inference outputs from PRECISE remain the same as those from the original DNNs, while data privacy is protected. To the best of our knowledge, PRECISE is the first of its kind to provide user-defined privacy protection for sensor data sharing among CAVs.

The talk will consider how teachers gain knowledge, skills, and a sense of agency to address inequities in computing learning experiences. Specifically, the discussion will illustrate three distinct ways that teacher leaders can serve as powerful agents of change: as effective facilitators for other teachers' learning experiences about inclusive computing, as curriculum co-designers of justice-oriented computing curriculum, and as advocates for equitable school policies.

AB The performance of silicon-based transistors is reaching its limit, and new materials like carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have started emerging to replace them in electronic products. However, the precise manipulation of CNTs requires complicated techniques, which increases process variation. These variations can lead to a decrease in the overall yield of the field-effect transistor (FET). This study shows how a low-frequency signal may regulate the number of CNTs on electrodes with a nanometer scale. We also demonstrate using an interdigitated electrode to reduce the shorts caused by metallic CNTs. The fabricated CNFETs were characterized using SEM, AFM, and I-V measurements. The study also demonstrates how the duration and amplitude of the applied signal impact the density of CNTs on the electrodes. Finally, finite element analysis was used to evaluate the electric field parameters during DEP. This technique will lead to precise CNTs per unit area, which can help fabricate transistors, sensors, and other electronic components.

AB Spoken language understanding (SLU) tasks have been studied for many decades in the speech research community, but have not received as much attention as lower-level tasks like speech and speaker recognition. In this work, we introduce several new annotated SLU benchmark tasks based on freely available speech data, which complement existing benchmarks and address gaps in the SLU evaluation landscape. We contribute four tasks: question answering and summarization involve inference over longer speech sequences; named entity localization addresses the speech-specific task of locating the targeted content in the signal; dialog act classification identifies the function of a given speech utterance. In order to facilitate the development of SLU models that leverage the success of pre-trained speech representations, we will release a new benchmark suite, including for each task (i) curated annotations for a relatively small fine-tuning set, (ii) reproducible pipeline (speech recognizer + text model) and end-to-end baseline models and evaluation metrics, (iii) baseline model performance in various types of systems for easy comparisons. We present the details of data collection and annotation and the performance of the baseline models. We also analyze the sensitivity of pipeline models' performance to the speech recognition accuracy, using more than 20 publicly available speech recognition models.

AB High definition (HD) map is a key technology that enables autonomous driving, which has the characteristic of frequent updates and low delay requirements. In order to minimize the HD map updating latency, this paper jointly considers the generation and transmission processes of HD map. The generation process of HD map relies heavily on the data captured by different types of sensors, which is modeled by the federated analytics process. Also, in order to quantify the diversity of utilized sensors, the concept of love of variety is introduced in this paper. Then, considering HD map is composed of dynamic and static layers that have different latency requirements during the transmission process, this paper proposes a method to allocate edge server capacity to each HD map layer such that the overall information staleness can be minimized. Firstly, the deterministic edge capacity case is discussed and the solution is derived by obtaining the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. Then, considering the practice that an edge server provides services to multiple attached devices simultaneously, contentions among these devices make available capacity for the autonomous vehicle variational. Therefore, an uncertain edge capacity case is discussed as well, where the uncertainty is described by Wasserstein metrics and the problem is reformulated into distributional robust chance constrained optimization problem. And for the low latency purpose, we utilize an inner approximation to reduce the complexity of the original problem and find a suboptimal solution. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods that achieves the lowest latency for HD map updating.

AB This study presents a technoeconomic analysis (TEA) for a novel ionic polybutylene adipate-co-terephthalate (PBAT), CPBAT, as a paper coating material, showcasing excellent water and oil resistance. This TEA determined total capital investment, operating costs, and minimum selling prices for a production capacity of 1,000 kg of CPBAT per day. The minimum selling prices of CPBAT coated on Kraft paper (CPBAT-K) and CPABT coated on starch-coated Kraft paper (CPBAT-S) are estimated to be $1.327/m(2) and $1.864/m(2), respectively. Additionally, the results of a sensitivity analysis show that the production of CPBAT-K and CPBAT-S is highly sensitive to the production capacity, raw material costs, energy efficiency of the coating process, reaction energy, and reaction yield. Recovery of the ionization solvent only marginally increases the selling prices of CPBAT-K and CPBAT-S, and hence, it is highly favorable. By increasing production capacity, lowering raw material costs, using energy-efficient coating machines, and partially recovering energy from reactions, the prices of CPBAT-K and CPBAT-S can be reduced to $0.588/m(2) and $0.914/m(2), respectively. Given that commercial polyethylene-coated paper prices range from $0.94/m(2) to $1.850/m(2), CPBAT-based coated papers with comparable mechanical and barrier properties along with biodegradability and recyclability are positioned as highly competitive and sustainable alternatives in the market.

These lenses store the phase and amplitude profile of the desired wavefront when illuminated by a single acoustic source to reconstruct ultrasound pressure fields, induce localized heating, and achieve temporal and spatial thermal effects in acousto-thermal materials like polymers. The ultrasonic energy is transmitted and focused by AHL from a transducer into a particular focal volume. It is then converted to heat by internal friction in the polymer chains, causing the temperature of the polymer to rise at the focus locations while having little to no effect elsewhere. This one-of-a-kind capability is made possible by the development of AHLs to make use of the translation of attenuated pressure fields into programmable heat patterns. However, the impact of acousto-thermal dynamics on the generation of AHLs is largely unexplored. We use a machine learning-assisted single inverse problem approach for rapid and efficient AHLs' design to generate thermal patterns. The process involves the conversion of thermal information into a holographic representation through the utilization of two latent functions: pressure phase and amplitude. Experimental verification is performed for pressure and thermal measurements. The volumetric acousto-thermal analyses of experimental samples are performed to offer a knowledge of the obtained pattern dynamics, as well as the applicability of holographic thermal mapping for precise volumetric temperature control. Finally, the proposed framework aims to provide a solid foundation for volumetric analysis of acousto-thermal patterns within thick samples and for assessing thermal changes with outer surface measurements.

AB Transfer learning refers to transferring the knowledge of a specific domain to a related domain. In cases where the source and the target learner have similar distribution and parameters, transfer learning can reduce the cost of learning and the construction of the target learner and improve the performance of the target learner. In wireless ad-hoc networks, the users connect to networks based on the service location, and various network channels with different levels of quality-of-service (QoS) are available. The wireless channels represent specific ranges of radio frequencies. When the users move from one location to another, the mobile application may switch channels for good quality of service. This paper predicts the wireless channel based on the user's location. Since channel prediction based on location is feasible in one city, the knowledge of channel prediction in one city can be transferred to another city. Thus, transfer learning is applicable and effective in such applications. The paper uses two cities' wireless mapping datasets to predict network channels and uses transfer learning to predict one city's network channels based on the other city's model. Experiments using different initial learning rates during training and different source and target domain data ratios show that transfer learning is feasible for network prediction among different cities.

AB Future millimeter wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz) communication and sensing systems will likely rely on arrays with massive numbers of elements for beamforming and spatial multiplexing. Building such arrays in traditional active architectures (either RF or digital phase shifting) is enormously challenging from a power consumption standpoint. In this paper, we consider a transmit array architecture for mmWave and THz massive MIMO, that requires much less hardware resources and power consumption. We show that transmit arrays consisting of a small active array and a passive metasurface exhibit the ability to generate steerable highly directional beams, which enables fundamental requirements for mmWave and THz MIMO systems. We describe a flexible ultra-thin metasurface using a C-shape split ring resonator (SRR) for near-field phase correction. Simulated results demonstrate a decent high-gain pencil beam creation and good beam-steering capability by employing a compact active phased array integrated with a large-size conformal passive metasurface.

AB The recent proliferation of various wireless sensing systems and applications demonstrates the advantages of radio frequency (RF) signals over traditional camera-based solutions that are faced with various challenges, such as occlusions and poor lighting conditions. Towards the ultimate goal of imaging human body using RF signals, researchers have been exploring the possibility of constructing the human mesh, a structure capturing not only the pose but also the shape of the human body, from RF signals. In this paper, we introduce M(4)esh, a novel system that utilizes commercial millimeter wave (mmWave) radar for multi-subject 3D human mesh construction. Our M(4)esh system can detect and track the subjects on a 2D energy map by predicting the subject bounding boxes on the map, and tackle the subjects' mutual occlusion through utilizing the location, velocity and size information of the subjects' bounding boxes from the previous frames as a clue to estimate the bounding box in the current frame. Through extensive experiments on a real-world COTS millimeter-wave testbed, we show that our proposed M(4)esh system can accurately localize the subjects and generate their human meshes, which demonstrate the superior effectiveness of the proposed M(4)esh system.

AB Attention deficit disorder is a frequently observed symptom in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This condition can present significant obstacles for those affected, manifesting in challenges such as sustained focus, task completion, and the management of distractions. These issues can impede learning, social interactions, and daily functioning. This complexity of symptoms underscores the need for tailored approaches in both educational and therapeutic settings to support individuals with ASD effectively. In this study, we have expanded upon our initial virtual reality (VR) prototype, originally created for attention therapy, to conduct a detailed statistical analysis. Our objective was to precisely identify and measure any significant differences in attention-related outcomes between sessions and groups. Our study found that heart rate (HR) and electrodermal activity (EDA) were more responsive to attention shifts than temperature. The 'Noise' and 'Score' strategies significantly affected eye openness, with the ASD group showing more responsiveness. The control group had smaller pupil sizes, and the ASD group's pupil size increased notably when switching strategies in Session 1. Distraction log data showed that both 'Noise' and 'Object Opacity' strategies influenced attention patterns, with the 'Red Vignette' strategy showing a significant effect only in the ASD group. The responsiveness of HR and EDA to attention shifts and the changes in pupil size could serve as valuable physiological markers to monitor and guide these interventions. These findings further support evidence that VR has positive implications for helping those with ASD, allowing for more tailored personalized interventions with meaningful impact.

AB The planted densest subgraph detection problem refers to the task of testing whether in a given (random) graph there is a subgraph that is unusually dense. Specifically, we observe an undirected and unweighted graph on n vertices. Under the null hypothesis, the graph is a realization of an Erdos-Renyi graph with edge probability (or, density) q . Under the alternative, there is a subgraph on k vertices with edge probability p > q . The statistical as well as the computational barriers of this problem are well -understood for a wide range of the edge parameters p and q . In this paper, we consider a natural variant of the above problem, where one can only observe a relatively small part of the graph using adaptive edge queries. For this model, we determine the number of queries necessary and sufficient (accompanied with a quasi -polynomial optimal algorithm) for detecting the presence of the planted subgraph. We also propose a polynomial -time algorithm which is able to detect the planted subgraph, albeit with more queries compared to the above lower bound. We conjecture that in the leftover regime, no polynomial -time algorithms exist. Our results resolve two open questions posed in the past literature.

AB We develop a suite of 3D hydrodynamic models of supernova remnants (SNRs) expanding against the circumstellar medium (CSM). We study the Rayleigh-Taylor instability forming at the expansion interface by calculating an angular power spectrum for each of these models. The power spectra of young SNRs are seen to exhibit a dominant angular mode, which is a diagnostic of their ejecta density profile as found by previous studies. The steep scaling of power at smaller modes and the time evolution of the spectra are indicative of the absence of a turbulent cascade. Instead, as the time evolution of the spectra suggests, they may be governed by an angular mode-dependent net growth rate. We also study the impact of anisotropies in the ejecta and in the CSM on the power spectra of velocity and density. We confirm that perturbations in the density field (whether imposed on the ejecta or the CSM) do not influence the anisotropy of the remnant significantly unless they have a very large amplitude and form large-scale coherent structures. In any case, these clumps can only affect structures on large angular scales. The power spectrum on small angular scales is completely independent of the initial clumpiness and governed only by the growth and saturation of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability.

AB Revolutionary advances in artificial intelligence (AI) in the past decade have brought transformative innovation across science and engineering disciplines. In the field of Arctic science, we have witnessed an increasing trend in the adoption of AI, especially deep learning, to support the analysis of Arctic big data and facilitate new discoveries. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the applications of deep learning in sea ice remote sensing domains, focusing on problems such as sea ice lead detection, thickness estimation, sea ice concentration and extent forecasting, motion detection, and sea ice type classification. In addition to discussing these applications, we also summarize technological advances that provide customized deep learning solutions, including new loss functions and learning strategies to better understand sea ice dynamics. To promote the growth of this exciting interdisciplinary field, we further explore several research areas where the Arctic sea ice community can benefit from cutting-edge AI technology. These areas include improving multimodal deep learning capabilities, enhancing model accuracy in measuring prediction uncertainty, better leveraging AI foundation models, and deepening integration with physics-based models. We hope that this paper can serve as a cornerstone in the progress of Arctic sea ice research using AI and inspire further advances in this field.

AB Context effects in multi-alternative, multi-attribute choice are widely documented, but often elusive. We show that this elusiveness can arise in part from the way that choices are presented. To illustrate this, we use a modeling framework to predict how changes to the format of attribute values, specifically the commensurability of attribute values, influences attention allocation and consequently context effects. Guided by this framework, we show in two online choice experiments (total N = 954 adults) that manipulating the commensurability of attributes leads to different patterns of context effects. Robust attraction and compromise effects are found when attributes are incommensurable (e.g., CPU speed in GHz and RAM memory in GB, or quality ratings on different scales), and mostly null effects occur when attributes are commensurable (e.g., quality ratings on the same scale). Our findings show how the format of choice information can substantially alter the integration of that information and resulting choice patterns.

AB This paper reports on the effects of shear rate and interface modeling parameters on the hydrodynamic slip length (L-S) for water-graphite interfaces calculated using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics. Five distinct non-bonded solid-liquid interaction parameters were considered to assess their impact on L-S. The interfacial force field derivations included sophisticated electronic structure calculation-informed and empirically determined parameters. All interface models exhibited a similar and bimodal L-S response when varying the applied shear rate. L-S in the low shear rate regime (LSR) is in good agreement with previous calculations obtained through equilibrium molecular dynamics. As the shear rate increases, L-S sharply increases and asymptotes to a constant value in the high shear regime (HSR). It is noteworthy that L-S in both the LSR and HSR can be characterized by the density depletion length, whereas solid-liquid adhesion metrics failed to do so. For all interface models, L-HSR calculations were, on average, similar to 28% greater than L-LSR, and this slip jump was confirmed using the SPC/E and TIP4P/2005 water models. To address the L-S transition from the LSR to the HSR, the viscosity of water and the interfacial friction coefficient were investigated. It was observed that in the LSR, the viscosity and friction coefficient decreased at a similar rate, while in the LSR-to-HSR transition, the friction coefficient decreased at a faster rate than the shear viscosity until they reached a new equilibrium, hence explaining the L-S-bimodal behavior. This study provides valuable insights into the interplay between interface modeling parameters, shear rate, and rheological properties in understanding hydrodynamic slip behavior.

AB The ensemble forecast dominates the computational cost of many data assimilation methods, especially for high-resolution and coupled models. In situations where the cost is prohibitive, one can either use a lower-cost model or a lower-cost data assimilation method, or both. Ensemble optimal interpolation (EnOI) is a classical example of a lower-cost ensemble data assimilation method that replaces the ensemble forecast with a single forecast and then constructs an ensemble about this single forecast by adding perturbations drawn from climatology. This research develops lower-cost ensemble data assimilation methods that add perturbations to a single forecast, where the perturbations are obtained from analogs of the single model forecast. These analogs can either be found from a catalog of model states, constructed using linear combinations of model states from a catalog, or constructed using generative machine-learning methods. Four analog ensemble data assimilation methods, including two new ones, are compared with EnOI in the context of a coupled model of intermediate complexity: Q-GCM. Depending on the method and on the physical variable, analog methods can be up to 40% more accurate than EnOI.

DE Few-shot classification; Spurious bias; Robustness; Benchmark system
AB Few-shot image classifiers are designed to recognize and classify new data with minimal supervision and limited data but often show reliance on spurious correlations between classes and spurious attributes, known as spurious bias. Spurious correlations commonly hold in certain samples and few-shot classifiers can suffer from spurious bias induced from them. There is an absence of an automatic benchmarking system to assess the robustness of few-shot classifiers against spurious bias. In this paper, we propose a systematic and rigorous benchmark framework, termed FewSTAB, to fairly demonstrate and quantify varied degrees of robustness of few-shot classifiers to spurious bias. FewSTAB creates few-shot evaluation tasks with biased attributes so that using them for predictions can demonstrate poor performance. To construct these tasks, we propose attribute-based sample selection strategies based on a pre-trained vision-language model, eliminating the need formanual dataset curation. This allows FewSTAB to automatically benchmark spurious bias using any existing test data. FewSTAB offers evaluation results in a new dimension along with a new design guideline for building robust classifiers. Moreover, it can benchmark spurious bias in varied degrees and enable designs for varied degrees of robustness. Its effectiveness is demonstrated through experiments on ten few-shot learning methods across three datasets. We hope our framework can inspire new designs of robust few-shot classifiers. Our code is available at https://github.com/gtzheng/FewSTAB.

AB Traditional PFAS analysis by mass spectrometry (MS) is time-consuming, as laborious sample preparation (e.g., extraction and desalting) is necessary. Herein, we report fast detection of PFAS by paper spray (PS) -based MS techniques, which employs a triangular -shaped filter paper for sample loading and ionization (<= 3 min per sample). In this study, PS -MS was first used for direct PFAS analysis of drinking water, tap water, and wastewater. Interestingly, food package paper materials can be directly cut and examined with PS -MS for possible PFAS contamination. For samples containing salt matrices which would suppress PFAS ion signal, desalting paper spray mass spectrometry (DPS-MS), was shown to be capable of rapidly desalting, ionizing and detecting PFAS species such as per-fluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and per-fluorosulphonic acid (PFOS). The retention of PFAS on paper substrate while salts being washed away by water is likely due to hydrophilic interaction between the PFAS polar head (e.g., carboxylic acid, sulfonic acid) with the polar filter paper cellulose surface. The DPS-MS method is highly sensitive (limits of detection:1.2-4.5 ppt) and can be applicable for directly analyzing soil extract and soil samples. These results suggest the high potential of PS -MS and the related DPS-MS technique in real -world environmental analysis of PFAS.

AB Online computer science (CS) courses have broadened access to CS education, yet inclusivity barriers persist for minoritized groups in these courses. One problem that recent research has shown is that often inclusivity biases ("inclusivity bugs") lurk within the course materials themselves, disproportionately disadvantaging minoritized students. To address this issue, we investigated how a faculty member can use AID-an Automated Inclusivity Detector tool-to remove such inclusivity bugs from a large online CS1 (Intro CS) course and what is the impact of the resulting inclusivity fixes on the students' experiences. To enable this evaluation, we first needed to (Bugs): investigate inclusivity challenges students face in 5 online CS courses; (Build): build decision rules to capture these challenges in courseware ("inclusivity bugs") and implement them in the AID tool; (Faculty): investigate how the faculty member followed up on the inclusivity bugs that AID reported; and (Students): investigate how the faculty member's changes impacted students' experiences via a before-vs-after qualitative study with CS students. Our results from (Bugs) revealed 39 inclusivity challenges spanning courseware components from the syllabus to assignments. After implementing the rules in the tool (Build), our results from (Faculty) revealed how the faculty member treated AID more as a "peer" than an authority in deciding whether and how to fix the bugs. Finally, the study results with (Students) revealed that students found the after-fix courseware more approachable - feeling less overwhelmed and more in control in contrast to the before-fix version where they constantly felt overwhelmed, often seeking external assistance to understand course content.

AB Data-driven methods have gained increasing attention in computational mechanics and design. This study investigates a two-scale data-driven design for thermal metamaterials with various functionalities. To address the complexity of multiscale design, the design variables are chosen as the components of the homogenized thermal conductivity matrix originating from the lower scale unit cells. Multiple macroscopic functionalities including thermal cloak, thermal concentrator, thermal rotator/inverter, and their combinations, are achieved using the developed approach. Sensitivity analysis is performed to determine the effect of each design variable on the desired functionalities, which is then incorporated into topology optimization. Geometric extraction demonstrates an excellent matching between the optimized homogenized conductivity and the extraction from the constructed database containing both architecture and property information. The designed heterostructures exhibit multiple thermal meta-functionalities that can be applied to a wide range of heat transfer fields from personal computers to aerospace engineering.

SO KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS

DT Article
DE Fair machine learning; Adversarial robustness; Human face recognition
AB Developing fair deep learning models for identity-sensitive applications (e.g., face attribute recogni-tion) has gained increasing attention from the research community. Indeed, it has been observed that deep models can easily overfit to the bias of the training set, resulting in discriminative performance against certain demographic groups during test time. Motivated by the observation that a biased clas-sifier could result in different adversarial robustness among training samples in different demographic groups (robustness bias), we argue that such adversarial robustness information of individual training samples could imply whether the training data distribution is fair among different demographic groups. In other words, under a fair classifier, the training samples from different demographic groups are expected to show similar or comparable adversarial robustness. Therefore, in this work, we propose to re-weight the training loss of individual training samples using their adversarial robustness, and provide the fairness-awareness in the training process. Extensive experimental results on CelebA dataset show that the face attribute classifiers could learn significantly greater demographic fairness under our proposed training objective and outperform other state-of-the-art re-weighting fairness algorithms on different face recognition applications. Moreover, our proposed method also reduces the non-trivial robustness bias among different demographic groups, preventing the under-represented demographic groups from higher adversarial threats.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB The thermal decomposition mechanism of trimethylchlorosilane at temperatures up to 1400 K was investigated using flash pyrolysis microreactor coupled with vacuum ultraviolet (118.2 nm) photoionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The main initiation reaction of the parent molecule was identified to be HCl molecular elimination producing Me2Si=CH2, and its onset temperature was estimated to be around 1210 K. The methyl loss channel was also observed at an onset temperature of similar to 1280 K. Other possible initiation pathways such as chlorine atom loss and methane molecular elimination were considered to be insignificant. Quantum chemistry calculations at the UCCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ//UM05-2X/aug-cc-pVDZ level of theory were performed to study the energetics of the possible initiation pathways. The theoretical calculations revealed that the HCl elimination channel via a van der Waals intermediate was the most energetically favored pathway among all the initiation channels, in agreement with the experimental observations. Transition state theory (TST) and variational transition state theory (VTST) calculations were employed to calculate unimolecular dissociation rate constants of the initiation reactions at elevated temperatures. The results supported the experimental observations and reaction energetics calculations that the HCl molecular elimination reaction was the most prominent initiation reaction and the CH3 loss channel was a significant initiation reaction channel. Secondary reactions of the initial products were identified, and the possible mechanisms were proposed. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Monitoring water harvesting in metal-organic frameworks, one water

SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID POTENTIAL-ENERGY SURFACE; ADSORPTION; SIMULATIONS
AB Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have gained prominence as potential materials for atmospheric water harvesting, a vital solution for arid regions and areas experiencing severe water shortages. However, the molecular factors influencing the performance of MOFs in capturing water from the air remain elusive. Among all MOFs, Ni2X2BTDD (X = F, Cl, Br) stands out as a promising water harvester due to its ability to adsorb substantial amounts of water at low relative humidity (RH). Here, we use advanced molecular dynamics simulations carried out with the state-of-the-art MB-pol data-driven many-body potential to monitor water adsorption in the three Ni2X2BTDD variants as a function of RH. Our simulations reveal that the type of halide atom in the three Ni2X2BTDD frameworks significantly influences the corresponding molecular mechanisms of water adsorption: while water molecules form strong hydrogen bonds with the fluoride atoms in Ni2F2BTDD, they tend to form hydrogen bonds with the nitrogen atoms of the triazolate linkers in Ni2Cl2BTDD and Ni2Br2BTDD. Importantly, the large size of the bromide atoms reduces the void volume in the Ni2Br2BTDD pores, which enable water molecules to initiate an extended hydrogen-bond network at lower RH. These findings not only underscore the prospect for precisely tuning structural and chemical modifications of the frameworks to optimize their interaction with water, but also highlight the predictive power of simulations with the MB-pol data-driven many-body potential. By providing a realistic description of water under different thermodynamic conditions and environments, these simulations yield unique, molecular-level insights that can guide the design and optimization of energy-efficient water harvesting materials.
   Data-driven many-body simulations provide the first realistic view of water harvesting in metal-organic frameworks as a function of relative humidity.

AB The Dragonfly networks have been adopted in the current supercomputers, and will be deployed in future generation supercomputers and data centers. Effective routing on Dragonfly is challenging. Universal Globally Adaptive Load-balanced routing (UGAL) is the state-of-the-art routing algorithm for Dragonfly. For each packet, UGAL selects either a minimal path or a non-minimal path based on their estimated latencies. Practical UGAL makes routing decisions with local information, deriving the estimated latency for each path from the local queue occupancy and path hop count information. In this work, we develop techniques to improve the accuracy of the latency estimation for UGAL with local information, which results in more effective routing decisions. In particular, our schemes are able to proactively mitigate the potential network congestion with imbalanced network traffic. Extensive simulation experiments using synthetic traffic patterns and application workloads demonstrate that our enhanced UGAL schemes significantly improve the routing performance for many common traffic conditions.

TI Robustness and classical proxy of entanglement in variants of quantum
   walks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
LA English
DT Article
AB A quantum walk (QW) utilizes its internal quantum states to decide the displacement, thereby introducing single-particle entanglement between the internal and positional degrees of freedom. By simulating three variants of QWs with the conventional, symmetric, and split-step translation operators with or without classical randomness in the coin operator, we show the entanglement is robust against both time- and spatially dependent randomness, which can cause localization transitions of QWs. We propose a classical quantity called overlap, which literally measures the overlap between the probability distributions of the internal states as a proxy of entanglement. The overlap is associated with the off-diagonal terms of the reduced density matrix in the internal space, which then reflects its purity. Therefore, the overlap captures the inverse behavior of the entanglement entropy in most cases. We test the limitation of the classical proxy by constructing a special case with high population imbalance between the internal states to blind the overlap. Possible implications and experimental measurements are also discussed.

AB The advent of diverse frequency bands in 5G networks has promoted measurement studies focused on 5G signal propagation, aiming to understand its pathloss, coverage, and channel quality characteristics. Nonetheless, conducting a thorough 5G measurement campaign is markedly laborious given the large number of samples that must be collected. To alleviate this burden, the present contribution leverages principled active learning (AL) methods to prudently select only a few, yet most informative locations to collect samples. The core idea is to rely on a Gaussian Process (GP) model to efficiently extrapolate measurements throughout the coverage area. Specifically, an ensemble (E) of GP models is adopted that not only provides a rich learning function space, but also quantifies uncertainty, and can offer accurate predictions. Building on this EGP model, a suite of acquisition functions (AFs) are advocated to query new locations on-the-fly. To account for realistic scenaria, the proposed AFs are augmented with a novel distance-based AL rule that selects informative samples, while penalizing queries at long distances. Numerical tests on 5G data generated by the Sionna simulator and on real urban and suburban datasets, showcase the merits of the novel EGP-AL approaches.

AB Nonlinear mean field dynamics enables quantum information processing operations that are impossible in linear one-particle quantum mechanics. In this approach, a register of bosonic qubits (such as neutral atoms or polaritons) is initialized into a symmetric product state vertical bar psi >(circle times n) through condensation, then subsequently controlled by varying the qubit-qubit interaction. An experimental implementation of quantum state discrimination, an important subroutine in quantum computation, with a toroidal Bose-Einstein condensate is proposed. The condensed bosons here are atoms, each in the same superposition of angular momenta 0 and h, encoding a qubit. A nice feature of the protocol is that only a readout of individual quantized circulation states (not superpositions) is required.

AB Representational forms are central to howwe explore, communicate, and learn. Yet, they can be challenging to engage with as designers because they vary across disciplines, cultures, and communities. In this paper, we describe our analysis of a dance and computing learning environment through the lens of distributed cognition to examine how representations and processing of information across people and systems impacted the learning process. We analyzed video and audio data from three workshops of dance and STEM instructors learning about, creating with, and co-designing computing activities with danceON-a creative computing platform that supports coding animations over dance videos. We identified the ways that the instructors used their bodies as a shared point of negotiation while co-creating dance artifacts, the participatory role of danceON within the sensemaking process, the ways that the instructors interpreted and translated representations across physical and digital spaces, and the impact of the instructors' collaborative interactions to their sensemaking.

AB In many application domains including medical imaging, experimental design, as well as robotics, labeled data are expensive to acquire while unlabeled samples are abundant. Such high labeling costs well motivate the active learning (AL) paradigm that judiciously selects the most informative data instances to label. Specifically, this paper considers a streaming AL setting where unlabeled samples arrive sequentially and an oracle decides to label them or not based on a certain criterion. This active labeling process can benefit from a statistical function model, that provides well-calibrated uncertainty values to guide the oracle to make the informed labeling decision. Towards statistical modeling with adaptivity and robustness in the streaming setting, a recently developed ensemble Gaussian process (EGP) model is leveraged that has weights adapted to the labeled data collected incrementally. Building on this EGP model, this work advocates a novel labeling criterion where the oracle calculates the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the predictive pdfs of each unlabeled instance to make the labeling decision. Numerical tests on synthetic and real datasets in the regression task showcase the merits of the proposed EGP-AL approach relative to the competing alternatives.

AB Video anomaly detection (VAD) - commonly formulated as a multiple-instance learning problem in a weakly-supervised manner due to its labor-intensive nature - is a challenging problem in video surveillance where the frames of anomaly need to be localized in an untrimmed video. In this paper, we first propose to utilize the ViT-encoded visual features from CLIP, in contrast with the conventional C3D or I3D features in the domain, to efficiently extract discriminative representations in the novel technique. We then model temporal dependencies and nominate the snippets of interest by leveraging our proposed Temporal Self-Attention (TSA). The ablation study confirms the effectiveness of TSA and ViT feature. The extensive experiments show that our proposed CLIP-TSA outperforms the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by a large margin on three commonly-used benchmark datasets in the VAD problem (UCF-Crime, ShanghaiTech Campus and XD-Violence). Our source code is available at https://github.com/joos2010kj/CLIP-TSA.

AB Crowdsourcing data from connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) is a cost-efficient way to achieve high-definition maps with up-to-date transient road information. Achieving the map with deterministic latency performance is, however, challenging due to the unpredictable resource competition and distributional resource demands. In this paper, we propose CoMap, a new crowdsourcing high definition (HD) map to minimize the monetary cost of network resource usage while satisfying the percentile requirement of end-to-end latency. We design a novel CROP algorithm to learn the resource demands of CAV offloading, optimize offloading decisions, and proactively allocate temporal network resources in a fully distributed manner. In particular, we create a prediction model to estimate the uncertainty of resource demands based on Bayesian neural networks and develop a utilization balancing scheme to resolve the imbalanced resource utilization in individual infrastructures. We evaluate the performance of CoMap with extensive simulations in an automotive edge computing network simulator. The results show that CoMap reduces up to 80.4% average resource usage as compared to existing solutions.

AB Network slicing achieves cost-efficient slice customization to support heterogeneous applications and services. Configuring crossdomain resources to end-to-end slices based on service-level agreements, however, is challenging, due to the complicated underlying correlations and the simulation-to-reality discrepancy between simulators and real networks. In this paper, we propose Atlas, an online network slicing system, which automates the service configuration of slices via safe and sample-efficient learn-to-configure approaches in three interrelated stages. First, we design a learning-based simulator to reduce the sim-to-real discrepancy, which is accomplished by a new parameter searching method based on Bayesian optimization. Second, we offline train the policy in the augmented simulator via a novel offline algorithm with a Bayesian neural network and parallel Thompson sampling. Third, we online learn the policy in real networks with a novel online algorithm with safe exploration and Gaussian process regression. We implement Atlas on an end-to-end network prototype based on OpenAirInterface RAN, OpenDayLight SDN transport, OpenAir-CN core network, and Docker-based edge server. Experimental results show that, compared to state-of-the-art solutions, Atlas achieves 63.9% and 85.7% regret reduction on resource usage and slice quality of experience during the online learning stage, respectively.

AB Precision agriculture has emerged as a vital solution to meet the food demands of the growing global population. However, the high upfront costs of sensors, data analytics tools, and automation often pose challenges for smallscale farms, limiting their ability to adopt these advanced practices. Cooperative Smart Farming (CSF) provides a practical solution to address the evolving needs of modern farming, making precision agriculture more accessible and affordable for small-scale farms. These cooperatives are formal enterprises collectively financed, managed, and operated by member farms, working together for shared benefits. Though it benefits small-scale farmers, all member farms can embrace advanced technologies through collective investment and data sharing by joining cooperatives. As Smart Agriculture grows, CSFs are poised to be essential in building a more sustainable, resilient, and profitable agriculture for all member farms. However, CSFs face increased cybersecurity risks as technology reliance grows. Cyberattacks on one farm can disrupt the entire network, threatening data integrity and decision- making. Federated Learning (FL)-based anomaly detection has been proposed to address this, allowing farms to detect threats locally and share only model updates. However, cooperatives' data sharing and interconnected nature introduce challenges in developing the anomaly detection model. This model must detect threats early and take preventive actions, as delays could result in successful attacks on other smart farms in the network. Additionally, if more smart farms join the cooperative, the model gradient updates can still be transmitted to the server quickly without overwhelming communication channels and causing delays. To address these challenges, in this research, we develop an efficient Federated Transfer Learning FTL based network anomaly detection model for the CSF environment. We also use a dynamic low-rank compression algorithm to reduce the communication latency. To evaluate this proposed approach, we first set up two independent smart farming testbeds incorporating various sensors commonly used in smart farming. We then launch different cyberattacks in each smart farm and collected two network datasets. For proof of concept, we implement and assess the robustness of our proposed model based on metrics such as identifying anomalies, memory consumption, training time, and accuracy using two network datasets. The experiments demonstrated that our proposed model achieves higher accuracy and requires less training time than traditional FL algorithms, enabling early and efficient attack detection in CSF and minimizing the impact of cyberattacks on member farms.

TI Prosociality in Microtransit
SO JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH

DT Article
ID SOCIAL VALUE ORIENTATION; MODEL
AB We study (public) microtransit, a type of transportation service wherein a municipality offers point-to-point rides to residents, for a fixed, nominal fare. Microtransit exemplifies practical resource allocation problems that are often over-constrained in that not all ride requests (pickup and drop off locations at specified times) can be satisfied or satisfied only by violating soft goals such as sustainability, and where economic signals (e.g., surge pricing) are not applicable-they would lead to unethical outcomes by effectively coercing poor people. We posit that instead of taking rider preferences as fixed, shaping them prosocially will lead to improved societal outcomes. Prosociality refers to an attitude or behavior that is intended to benefit others. This paper demonstrates a computational approach to prosociality in the context of a (public) microtransit service for disadvantaged riders. Prosociality appears as a willingness to adjust one's pickup and drop off times and locations to accommodate the schedules of others and to enable sharing rides (which increases the number of riders served with the same resources). This paper describes an interdisciplinary study of prosociality in microtransit between a transportation researcher, psychologists, a social scientist, and AI researchers. Our contributions are these: (1) empirical support for the viability of prosociality in microtransit (and constraints on it) through interviews with drivers and focus groups of riders; (2) a prototype mobile app demonstrating how our prosocial intervention can be combined with the transportation backend; (3) a reinforcement learning approach to model a rider and determine the best interventions to persuade that rider toward prosociality; and (4) a cognitive model of rider personas to enable evaluation of alternative interventions.

AB Graph-guided learning has well-documented impact in a gamut of network science applications. A prototypical graph-guided learning task deals with semi-supervised learning over graphs, where the goal is to predict the nodal values or labels of unobserved nodes, by leveraging a few nodal observations along with the underlying graph structure. This is particularly challenging under privacy constraints or generally when acquiring nodal observations incurs high cost. In this context, the present work puts forth a Bayesian graph-driven self-supervised learning (Self-SL) approach that: (i) learns powerful nodal embeddings emanating from easier to solve auxiliary tasks that map local to global connectivity information; and, (ii) adopts an ensemble of Gaussian processes (EGPs) with adaptive weights as nodal embeddings are processed online. Unlike most existing deterministic approaches, the novel approach offers accurate estimates of the unobserved nodal values along with uncertainty quantification that is important especially in safety critical applications. Numerical tests on synthetic and real graph datasets showcase merits of the novel EGP-based Self-SL method.

AB Investigations of mate choice continue to address fundamental questions about the mechanisms and evolution of animal behaviour. A common behavioural assay used to study acoustically guided mate choice with playback experiments is phonotaxis, a typically robust response in which a chooser approaches acoustic signals, such as courtship songs or mating calls. Robust empirical studies of phonotaxis often require substantial laboratory facilities, such as a dedicated and sound-treated room or enclosure, in which the acoustic environment is controlled and in which animals are freely able to move about. The financial and space resources required to outfit a research laboratory to investigate phonotaxis may be sufficiently prohibitive such that some researchers are excluded from undertaking bioacoustic behavioural research. Here, we validate a new device designed to measure animal movements related to phonotaxis using an inertial measurement unit (IMU). The device is small and portable; it can be constructed for less than $300 USD ( pound 238 GBP); and the build instructions and code for operation are freely available. In a series of four experiments with treefrogs, we demonstrate using the device that an IMU-based approach to measuring animal movement can replicate a broad range of findings from traditional phonotaxis experiments on species recognition and sexual selection. We conclude by discussing several possible uses for IMU-based measurements of phonotaxis. (c) 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Flooding is a natural hazard that touches nearly all facets of the globe and is expected to become more frequent and intensified due to climate and land-use change. However, flooding does not impact all individuals equally. Therefore, understanding how flooding impacts distribute across populations of different socioeconomic and demographic backgrounds is vital. One approach to reducing flood risk on people is using indicators, such as social vulnerability indices and flood exposure metrics, to inform decision-making for flood risk management. However, such indicators can face the scale and zonal effect produced by the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP). This study investigates how the U.S. Census block group, tract, and county scale selection impacts social vulnerability and flood exposure outcomes within coastal Virginia, USA. Here we show how (1) scale selection can obstruct our understanding of drivers of vulnerability, (2) increasingly aggregated scales significantly undercount highly vulnerable populations, and (3) hotspot clusters of social vulnerability and flood exposure can identify variable priority areas for current and future flood risk reduction. Study results present considerations about using such indicators, given the real-life consequences that can occur due to the MAUP. The results of this work warrant understanding the implications of scale selection on research methodological approaches and what this means for practitioners and policymakers that utilize such information to help guide flood mitigation strategies.

AB Volcanic aerosols reduce global mean precipitation in the years after major eruptions, yet the mechanisms that produce this response have not been rigorously identified. Volcanic aerosols alter the atmosphere's energy balance, with precipitation changes being one pathway by which the atmosphere acts to return toward equilibrium. By examining the atmosphere's energy budget in climate model simulations using radiative kernels, we explain the global precipitation reduction as largely a consequence of Earth's surface cooling in response to volcanic aerosols reflecting incoming sunlight. These aerosols also directly add energy to the atmosphere by absorbing outgoing longwave radiation, which is a major cause of precipitation decline in the first post-eruption year. We additionally identify factors limiting the post-eruption precipitation decline, and provide evidence that our results are robust across climate models.
   Large volcanic eruptions can emit gas into the stratosphere that chemically forms sulfate aerosol particles. These aerosols persist in the stratosphere for up to 2 years, and have been linked to widespread precipitation changes in studies based on observations and models. Here we identify the mechanisms through which volcanic aerosols cause their clearest precipitation impact, a temporary reduction in global mean precipitation. Volcanic aerosols globally inhibit precipitation as a result of their abilities to both reflect incoming solar radiation and absorb longwave (terrestrial) radiation. The first is the more important influence on global precipitation, which is reduced for several years as an energetic response to cooler tropospheric temperatures. Absorption of longwave radiation further reduces precipitation during the first post-eruption year, as a response to the increased energy brought into the stratosphere.
   We identify the mechanisms of volcanic aerosol influence on global precipitation by assessing the atmospheric energy budget in simulations Post-eruption precipitation reduction is largely a consequence of a cooler surface, with latent heat balancing a less emissive troposphere Volcanic aerosols absorb outgoing longwave radiation into the stratosphere, and the added energy causes additional precipitation reduction

AB Integrated circuits are often fabricated in untrusted facilities, making intellectual property privacy a concern. This prompted the development of logic locking, a security technique that corrupts the functionality of a design without a correct secret key. Prior work has shown that system-level phenomena can degrade the security of locking, highlighting the importance of configuring locking in a system. In this work, we propose a design space modeling framework to generate system-level models of the logic locking design space in arbitrary ICs by simulating a small, carefully-selected portion of the design space. These models are used to automatically identify near-optimal locking configurations in a system that achieve security goals with minimal power/area overhead. We evaluate our framework with two experiments. 1) We evaluate the quality of modeling-produced solutions by exhaustively simulating locking in a RISC-V ALU. The models produced by our algorithm had an average R-2 > 0.99 for all design objectives and identified a locking configuration within 96% of the globally optimal solution after simulating < 3.6% of the design space. 2) We compare our model-based locking to conventional module-level locking in a RISC-V processor. The locking configuration from our model-based approach required 29.5% less power on average than conventional approaches and was the only method to identify a solution meeting all design objectives.

DE Intrusion detection systems (IDS); Snort; Suricata; detection rate;

AB Software Defined Networks (SDN) have been proposed as a possible development for next generation networking technology. In a SDN, Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) are used to replace the functions of traditional middleboxes. All of these VNFs can be controlled from a centralized controller, which comes with its own security concerns. However, there are many benefits that come from having a centralized controller as traffic can be easily controlled from a single point. This makes it interesting to further study security when it concerns SDN. This work looks to test intrusion detection system (IDS) performance under different configurations in a SDN in order to make security in SDN more robust. In this work, we take two IDSs, Snort and Suricata, and test their performance under different configurations and traffic loads. We test four different configurations: single, chain, parallel, and cross. Our findings seem to suggest that the cross configuration has the best performance of these IDS configurations.

AB Two-photon dissociation dynamics of the SH/SD radicals are investigated using the high-n Rydberg atom time-of-flight (HRTOF) technique. The H/D(S-2) + S(D-1) and H/D(S-2) + S(S-1) products are observed in the dissociation of the SH/SD radicals on the 2(2)pi and B-2 sigma(+) repulsive states, from sequential two-photon excitation via the A(2)sigma(+) (v ' = 0, J ' = 0.5-2.5) state. The angular distributions of both H/D(S-2) + S(D-1) and H/D(S-2) + S(S-1) product channels are anisotropic. The anisotropy parameter (beta) of the H(S-2) + S(D-1) products is similar to-0.8 +/- 0.1 (-0.9 +/- 0.05 for SD), and that of the H(S-2) + S(S-1) products is similar to 1.3 +/- 0.3 (1.2 for SD). The anisotropic angular distributions indicate that the SH/SD radicals promptly dissociate on the repulsive 2(2)pi and B-2 sigma(+) potential energy curves (PECs) along with some non-adiabatic crossings, leading to the H/D(S-2) + S(D-1) and H/D(S-2) + S(S-1) products, respectively. The bond dissociation energy of the ground-state X-2 pi(3/2) SH/SD to the ground-state H/D(S-2) + S(P-3(2)) products is measured to be D-0(S-H) = 29 253 +/- 20 cm(-1) and D-0(S-D) = 29 650 +/- 20 cm(-1), respectively. The dissociation energy of the A(2)sigma(+) state SH/SD to the H/D(S-2) + S(D-1) products is derived to be D-0[S-H(A)] = 7659 +/- 20 cm(-1) and D-0[S-D(A)] = 7940 +/- 20 cm(-1).

AB The Critical Assessment of Computational Hit-Finding Experiments (CACHE) Challenge series is focused on identifying small molecule inhibitors of protein targets using computational methods. Each challenge contains two phases, hit-finding and follow-up optimization, each of which is followed by experimental validation of the computational predictions. For the CACHE Challenge #1, the Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) WD40 Repeat (WDR) domain was selected as the target for in silico hit-finding and optimization. Mutations in LRRK2 are the most common genetic cause of the familial form of Parkinson's disease. The LRRK2 WDR domain is an understudied drug target with no known molecular inhibitors. Herein we detail the first phase of our winning submission to the CACHE Challenge #1. We developed a framework for the high-throughput structure-based virtual screening of a chemically diverse small molecule space. Hit identification was performed using the large-scale Deep Docking (DD) protocol followed by absolute binding free energy (ABFE) simulations. ABFEs were computed using an automated molecular dynamics (MD)-based thermodynamic integration (TI) approach. 4.1 billion ligands from Enamine REAL were screened with DD followed by ABFEs computed by MD TI for 793 ligands. 76 ligands were prioritized for experimental validation, with 59 compounds successfully synthesized and 5 compounds identified as hits, yielding a 8.5% hit rate. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of the combined DD and ABFE approaches for hit identification for a target with no previously known hits. This approach is widely applicable for the efficient screening of ultra-large chemical libraries as well as rigorous protein-ligand binding affinity estimation leveraging modern computational resources.

AB Single domain generalization (SDG) aims to train a robust model against unknown target domain shifts using data from a single source domain. Data augmentation has been proven an effective approach to SDG. However, the utility of standard augmentations, such as translate, or invert, has not been fully exploited in SDG; practically, these augmentations are used as a part of a data preprocessing procedure. Although it is intuitive to use many such augmentations to boost the robustness of a model to out-of-distribution domain shifts, we lack a principled approach to harvest the benefit brought from multiple these augmentations. Here, we conceptualize standard data augmentations with learnable parameters as semantics transformations that can manipulate certain semantics of a sample, such as the geometry or color of an image. Then, we propose Adversarial learning with Semantics Transformations (AdvST) that augments the source domain data with semantics transformations and learns a robust model with the augmented data. We theoretically show that AdvST essentially optimizes a distributionally robust optimization objective defined on a set of semantics distributions induced by the parameters of semantics transformations. We demonstrate that AdvST can produce samples that expand the coverage on target domain data. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, AdvST, despite being a simple method, is surprisingly competitive and achieves the best average SDG performance on the Digits, PACS, and DomainNet datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/gtzheng/AdvST.

AB Thanks in part to rapid advances in next-generation sequencing technologies, recent phylogenomic studies have demonstrated the pivotal role that non-tree-like evolution plays in many parts of the Tree of Life - the evolutionary history of all life on Earth. As such, the Tree of Life is not necessarily a tree at all, but is better described by more general graph structures such as a phylogenetic network. Another key ingredient in these advances consists of the computational methods needed for reconstructing phylogenetic networks from large-scale genomic sequence data. But virtually all of these methods either require multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) as input or utilize gene trees or other inputs that are computed using MSAs. All of the input MSAs and gene trees must be estimated on empirical data. The methods themselves do not directly account for upstream estimation error, and, apart from prior studies of phylogenetic tree reconstruction and anecdotal evidence, little is understood about the impact of estimated MSA and gene tree error on downstream species network reconstruction.
   We therefore undertake a performance study to quantify the impact of MSA error and gene tree error on state-of-the-art phylogenetic network inference methods. Our study utilizes synthetic benchmarking data aswell as genomic sequence data from mosquito and yeast. We find that upstream MSA and gene tree estimation error can have first-order effects on the accuracy of downstream network reconstruction and, to a lesser extent, its computational runtime. The effects become more pronounced on more challenging datasets with greater evolutionary divergence and more sampled taxa. Our findings highlight an important need for computational methods development: namely, scalable methods are needed to account for estimated MSA and gene tree error when reconstructing phylogenetic networks using unaligned biomolecular sequence data.

AB In this work we present a new stochastic framework for obtaining optimal treatment regimes in prostate cancer. We model the realistic scenario of randomized clinical trials for incorporating randomness related to interaction between a prostate cancer cell and androgen cell quota, due to cancer heterogeneities, across different patients in a given group, using a Liouville partial differential equation. We then solve two optimization problems: one for determining the model parameters to fit the measured data and the second to determine the optimal androgen deprivation therapy. The optimization problems are implemented using a positive, stable, and conservative finite volume solver for the Liouville equations and the projected nonlinear conjugate gradient method. Several numerical results, including comparison with ordinary differential equations modeling framework, demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of our proposed framework to obtain optimal treatment regimes in real time.

AB Motivation: Many university CS programs have begun teaching various types of CS-related societal issues using approaches such as ethics, Responsible CS, inclusive design, and more. However, some recent research suggests that, although these programs have been able to teach awareness, students often fail to act upon this awareness. To address this problem, University X's CS program tried an unusual approach-integrating hands-on inclusive design skills in small ways across all four years of the CS major. But did it work? That is, did the students who experienced this change across the major actually build more inclusive technology than the students who did not experience it?
   Objectives: This paper aims to answer this through addressing two research questions: (RQ1): Did students who learned inclusive design across the curriculum act to create more inclusive software? (RQ2): How did inclusivity (or lack thereof) manifest in students' projects?
   Method: To investigate these RQs, we conducted a case study of 22 term-long CS projects built by 22 teams consisting of a total of 92 3rd- and 4th-year CS students. Half of the student teams had experienced courses that had integrated inclusive design and the other half had not. The inclusive design elements University X taught were those of the GenderMag inclusive design method, so evaluating the students' term-long projects was done by GenderMag experts-industry-experienced UX and Software professionals with real-world GenderMag experience.
   Results: The inclusiveness of students' projects was higher Post-GenderMag, with fewer reports of inclusivity bugs and higher inclusivity ratings. Experts' evaluations also revealed the ways in which bias (e.g. bias against risk-averse users) and inclusion (e.g. inclusion of users with diverse information processing styles) appeared in students' projects.
   Implications: We believe this to be the first published evidence that compares student-built technology's inclusiveness before vs. after they have been taught inclusive design. These positive results suggest that teaching inclusive design across the curriculum can impact students beyond simply heightening awareness-moving them to act upon this new understanding by building technology that more inclusively serves a wider spectrum of society.

AB In this paper, we present a fractional decoding algorithm for a new family of codes which are constructed from the Hermitian curve, called r-Hermitian codes. These codes of length n are defined over an extension field F-q2i of F-q2 and the fractional decoding algorithms that we present are algorithms for error correction that use only aln symbols of a subfield of size q(2) as input into the decoding algorithm, where alpha < 1, meaning a fraction of the subsymbols that are typically utilized. We demonstrate that collaborative decoding of interleaved codes supports fractional decoding of the r-Hermitian codes, allowing for improved bounds on the fractional decoding radius.

AB 5G aims to offer not only significantly higher throughput than previous generations of cellular networks, but also promises millisecond (ms) and sub-millisecond (ultra-)low latency support at the 5G physical (PHY) layer for future applications. While prior measurement studies have confirmed that commercial 5G deployments can achieve up to several Gigabits per second (Gbps) throughput (especially with the mmWave 5G radio), are they able to deliver on the (sub) millisecond latency promise? With this question in mind, we conducted to our knowledge the first in-depth measurement study of commercial 5G mmWave PHY latency using detailed physical channel events and messages. Through carefully designed experiments and data analytics, we dissect various factors that influence 5G PHY latency of both downlink and uplink data transmissions, and explore their impacts on end-to-end delay. We find that while in the best cases, the 5G (mmWave) PHY-layer is capable of delivering ms/sub-ms latency (with a minimum of 0.09 ms for downlink and 0.76 ms for uplink), these happen rarely. A variety of factors such as channel conditions, re-transmissions, physical layer control and scheduling mechanisms, mobility, and application (edge) server placement can all contribute to increased 5G PHY latency (and thus end-to-end (E2E) delay). Our study provides insights to 5G vendors, carriers as well as application developers/content providers on how to better optimize or mitigate these factors for improved 5G latency performance.

AB Rising usage of deep neural networks to perform decision making in critical applications like medical diagnosis and financial analysis have raised concerns regarding their reliability and trustworthiness. As automated systems become more mainstream, it is important their decisions be transparent, reliable and understandable by humans for better trust and confidence. To this effect, concept-based models such as Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) and Self-Explaining Neural Networks (SENN) have been proposed which constrain the latent space of a model to represent high level concepts easily understood by domain experts in the field. Although concept-based models promise a good approach to both increasing explainability and reliability, it is yet to be shown if they demonstrate robustness and output consistent concepts under systematic perturbations to their inputs. To better understand performance of concept-based models on curated malicious samples, in this paper, we aim to study their robustness to adversarial perturbations, which are also known as the imperceptible changes to the input data that are crafted by an attacker to fool a well-learned concept-based model. Specifically, we first propose and analyze different malicious attacks to evaluate the security vulnerability of concept based models. Subsequently, we propose a potential general adversarial training-based defense mechanism to increase robustness of these systems to the proposed malicious attacks. Extensive experiments on one synthetic and two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attacks and the defense approach. An appendix of the paper with more comprehensive results can also be viewed at https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16080.

ID PREDICTIVE INFERENCE
AB This article develops a conformal prediction method for classification tasks that can adapt to random label contamination in the calibration sample, often leading to more informative prediction sets with stronger coverage guarantees compared to existing approaches. This is obtained through a precise characterization of the coverage inflation (or deflation) suffered by standard conformal inferences in the presence of label contamination, which is then made actionable through a new calibration algorithm. Our solution can leverage different modelling assumptions about the contamination process, while requiring no knowledge of the underlying data distribution or of the inner workings of the classification model. The empirical performance of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulations and an application to object classification with the CIFAR-10H image data set.

AB Given the growing significance of 2D materials in various optoelectronic applications, it is imperative to have simulation tools that can accurately and efficiently describe electron correlation effects in these systems. Here, we show that the recently developed bootstrap embedding (BE) accurately predicts electron correlation energies and structural properties for 2D systems. Without explicit dependence on the reciprocal space sum (k-points) in the correlation calculation, our proof-of-concept calculations shows that BE can typically recover similar to 99.5% of the total minimal basis electron correlation energy in 2D semimetal, insulator, and semiconductors. We demonstrate that BE can predict lattice constants and bulk moduli for 2D systems with high precision. Furthermore, we highlight the capability of BE to treat electron correlation in twisted bilayer graphene superlattices with large unit cells containing hundreds of carbon atoms. We find that as the twist angle decreases toward the magic angle, the correlation energy initially decreases in magnitude, followed by a subsequent increase. We conclude that BE is a promising electronic structure method for future applications to 2D materials.

AB Ensemble Kalman filters are an efficient class of algorithms for large-scale ensemble data assimilation, but their performance is limited by their underlying Gaussian approximation. A two-step framework for ensemble data assimilation allows this approximation to be relaxed: The first step updates the ensemble in observation space, while the second step regresses the observation state update back to the state variables. This paper develops a new quantile-conserving ensemble filter based on kernel-density estimation and quadrature for the scalar first step of the two-step framework. It is shown to perform well in idealized non-Gaussian problems, as well as in an idealized model of assimilating observations of sea-ice concentration.

AB We contrast Dirac's theory of transition probabilities and the theory of nonadiabatic transition probabilities, applied to a perturbed system that is coupled to a bath. In Dirac's analysis, the presence of an excited state |k(0)? in the time-dependent wave function constitutes a transition. In the nonadiabatic theory, a transition occurs when the wave function develops a term that is not adiabatically connected to the initial state. Landau and Lifshitz separated Dirac's excited-state coefficients into a term that follows the adiabatic theorem of Born and Fock and a nonadiabatic term that represents excitation across an energy gap. If the system remains coherent, the two approaches are equivalent. However, differences between the two approaches arise when coupling to a bath causes dephasing, a situation that was not treated by Dirac. For two-level model systems in static electric fields, we add relaxation terms to the Liouville equation for the time derivative of the density matrix. We contrast the results obtained from the two theories. In the analysis based on Dirac's transition probabilities, the steady state of the system is not an equilibrium state; also, the steady-state population ?(kk,s) increases with increasing strength of the perturbation and its value depends on the dephasing time T-2. In the nonadiabatic theory, the system evolves to the thermal equilibrium with the bath. The difference is not simply due to the choice of basis because the difference remains when the results are transformed to a common basis.

AB The integration of Terrestrial and Non-Terrestrial Networks (TNTNs) with the sixth-generation (6G) wireless ecosystem will revolutionize the futuristic communication networks by enabling comprehensive interconnection and quality of service. However, such an integrated network will raise serious security and privacy issues due to the insecure communication among untrusted participating entities over an open unsecured public channel. As a result, the entire ecosystem can be accessed by both legitimate users and adversaries. Distributed AI when integrated with blockchain has a great potential to provide a feasible alternative to solve the security and privacy issues of 6G-assisted TNTNs. As a case study, a distributed AI is first adopted to cooperatively participate in the training process of a global model directly on devices. This approach ensures privacy and security of user data, and also confirms that only valid data is used by smart contracts to execute consensus mechanism. The multiple parallel blockchain are employed to securely and efficiently manage, and share data at each layer of 6G-assisted TNTNs. The efficiency of the proposed framework is demonstrated by numerical findings. Finally, prospective open research issues in employing distributed AI and blockchain for 6G-assisted TNTNs are highlighted.

   Equation (SDE); Diffusion Enhanced Adversarial Training (DEAT)
AB Deep neural networks are susceptible to human imperceptible adversarial perturbations. One of the strongest defense mechanisms is Adversarial Training (AT). In this paper, we aim to address two predominant problems in AT. First, there is still little consensus on how to set hyperparameters with a performance guarantee for AT research, and customized settings impede a fair comparison between different model designs in AT research. Second, the robustly trained neural networks struggle to generalize well and suffer from tremendous overfitting. This paper focuses on the primary AT framework - Projected Gradient Descent Adversarial Training (PGD-AT). We approximate the dynamic of PGD-AT by a continuous-time Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE), and show that the diffusion term of this SDE determines the robust generalization. An immediate implication of this theoretical finding is that robust generalization is positively correlated with the ratio between learning rate and batch size. We further propose a novel approach, Diffusion Enhanced Adversarial Training (DEAT), to manipulate the diffusion term to improve robust generalization with virtually no extra computational burden. We theoretically show that DEAT obtains a tighter generalization bound than PGD-AT. Our empirical investigation is extensive and firmly attests that DEAT universally outperforms PGD-AT by a significant margin.

AB Orbital debris can cause catastrophic damage to satellites. Pieces of debris <10 cm in size are numerous and difficult to track using optical techniques. It has been proposed to track this debris using the waves they generate in ionospheric plasma. In situ measurements have potentially shown the presence of waves propagating at a variety of frequencies including the lower hybrid frequency omega(LH). This paper summarizes a hybrid PIC fluid model that has been developed. Results showing the generation of waves near the lower hybrid frequency in the wake of space debris using this model are also discussed.

AB A proper understanding of excited state properties of indole derivatives can lead to rational design of efficient fluorescent probes. The optically active La$$ {L}_a $$ and Lb$$ {L}_b $$ excited states of a series of substituted indoles, where a substituent was placed on position four, were calculated using equation of motion coupled cluster and time dependent density functional theory. The results indicate that most substituted indoles have a brighter second excited state corresponding to experimental absorption maxima, but a few with electron withdrawing substituents absorb more on the first excited state. Absorption on the first excited state may increase their fluorescence quantum yield, making them better probes. Electronic structure methods were found to predict the energies of the systems with electron withdrawing substituents more accurately than those with electron donating substituents. The excited states of both states correlated well with electrophilicity, similar to the experimental trends for the absorption maxima. Overall, these computational studies indicate that theory can be used to predict excited state properties of substituted indoles, when the substituent is an electron withdrawing group.
   Excited state calculations were performed on fourth-position indole derivatives to evaluate substituent effects on indole's absorption. Results show correlation of excitation energies to the electrophilicity parameter, and indicate that theory can predict excited state properties of indole derivatives with electron-withdrawing substituents. image

AB Self-organization of biomolecules can lead to the formation of liquid droplets, hydrogels, and irreversible aggregates that bear immense significance in biology and diseases. Despite the considerable number of studies conducted on biomolecular condensation in bulk solution, there is still a lack of understanding of how different surfaces regulate the condensation process. In this context, recent studies showed that, in contrast to zwitterionic lipid membranes, anionic membranes promoted the production of liquid droplets of FUsed in Sarcoma Low Complexity domain (FUS-LC) despite exhibiting no specific protein-lipid interactions. Moreover, the air-water interface led to a solid fibril-like aggregate of FUS-LC. The molecular mechanism of condensation/aggregation of proteins in response to surfaces of various charged states or levels of hydrophobicity remains to be better elucidated. Here, we provide initial insights into this question by investigating the stability of a small beta fibril state of FUS-LC in bulk solution vs. membrane- and air-water interfaces. We perform multiple independent molecular dynamics simulations with distinct starting conformations for each system to demonstrate the statistical significance of our findings. Our study demonstrates the stability of the FUS-LC fibril in the presence of anionic membranes on the mu s timescale while the fibril falls apart in bulk solution. We observe that a zwitterionic membrane does not enhance the stability of the fibril and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine (DOPS) has a higher propensity to stabilize the fibril than dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol (DOPG), in qualitative agreement with experiments. We further show that the fibril becomes more stable at the air-water interface. We pinpoint interfacial solvation at the membrane- and air-water interfaces as a key factor that contributes to the stabilization of the peptide assembly.
   The backbone hydrogen bonds of a peptide assembly derived from FUS-LC gain excess stability at the anionic membrane-water and air-water interfaces due to distinctive interfacial solvation properties.

AB Conformal prediction is a statistical tool for producing prediction regions for machine learning models that are valid with high probability. A key component of conformal prediction algorithms is a non-conformity score function that quantifies how different a model's prediction is from the unknown ground truth value. Essentially, these functions determine the shape and the size of the conformal prediction regions. While prior work has gone into creating score functions that produce multi-model prediction regions, such regions are generally too complex for use in downstream planning and control problems. We propose a method that optimizes parameterized shape template functions over calibration data, which results in non-conformity score functions that produce prediction regions with minimum volume. Our approach results in prediction regions that are multi-modal, so they can properly capture residuals of distributions that have multiple modes, and practical, so each region is convex and can be easily incorporated into downstream tasks, such as a motion planner using conformal prediction regions. Our method applies to general supervised learning tasks, while we illustrate its use in time-series prediction. We provide a toolbox and present illustrative case studies of F16 fighter jets and autonomous vehicles, showing an up to 68% reduction in prediction region area compared to a circular baseline region.

AB By aggregating multiple channels, Carrier Aggregation (CA) is an important technology for boosting cellular network bandwidth. Given diverse radio bands made available in 5G networks, CA plays a particularly critical role in achieving the goal of multi-Gbps throughput performance. In this paper, we carry out a timely comprehensive measurement study of CA deployment in commercial 5G networks (as well as 4G networks). We identify the key factors that influence whether CA is deployed and when, as well as which band combinations are used. Thus, we reveal the challenges posed by CA in 5G performance analysis and prediction as well as their implications in application quality-of-experience (QoE). We argue for and develop a novel CA-aware deep learning framework, dubbed Prism5G, which explicitly accounts for the complexity introduced by CA to more effectively predict 5G network throughput performance. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate the superiority of Prism5G over existing throughput prediction algorithms. Prism5G improves 5G throughput prediction accuracy by over 14% on average and a maximum of 22%. Using two use cases as examples, we further illustrate how Prism5G can aid applications in optimizing QoE performance.

AB Surface boundaries in supercells have been suspected of being important in the arrangement and concentration of vorticity for the development and intensification of tornadoes, but there has been little attention given to the effects of the underlying surface roughness on their behavior. This study investigates the impact of surface drag on the structure and evolution of these boundaries, their associated distribution of near-surface vorticity, and tornadogenesis and maintenance. Comparisons between idealized simulations without and with drag introduced in the mature stage of the storm prior to tornadogenesis reveal that the inclusion of surface drag substantially alters the low-level structure, particularly with respect to the number, location, and intensity of surface convergence boundaries. Substantial drag-generated horizontal vorticity induces rotor structures near the surface associated with the convergence boundaries in both the forward and rear flanks of the storm. Stretching of horizontal vorticity and subsequent tilting into the vertical along the convergence boundaries lead to elongated positive vertical vorticity sheets on the ascending branch of the rotors and the opposite on the descending branch. The larger near-surface pressure deficit associated with the faster development of the near-surface cyclone when drag is active creates a downward dynamic vertical pressure gradient force that suppresses vertical growth, leading to a weaker and wider tornado detached from the surrounding convergence boundaries. A conceptual model of the low-level structure of the tornadic supercell is presented that focuses on the contribution of surface drag, with the aim of adding more insight and complexity to previous conceptual models.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Tornado development is sensitive to near-surface processes, including those associated with front-like boundaries between regions of airflow within the parent storm. However, observations and theory are insufficient to understand these phenomena, and numerical simulation remains vital. In our simulations, we find that a change in a parameter that controls how much the near-surface winds are reduced by friction (or drag) can substantially alter the storm behavior and tornado potential. We investigate how surface drag affects the low-level storm structure, the distribution of regions of near-surface rotation, and the development of tornadoes within the simulation. Our results provide insight into the role of surface drag and lead to an improved conceptual model of the near-surface structure of a tornadic storm.

   sampling; Bayesian regret analysis
AB Bayesian optimization (BO) has well-documented merits for optimizing black-box functions with an expensive evaluation cost. Such functions emerge in applications as diverse as hyperparameter tuning, drug discovery, and robotics. BO hinges on a Bayesian surrogate model to sequentially select query points so as to balance exploration with exploitation of the search space. Most existing works rely on a single Gaussian process (GP) based surrogate model, where the kernel function form is typically preselected using domain knowledge. To bypass such a design process, this paper leverages an ensemble (E) of GPs to adaptively select the surrogate model fit on-the-fly, yielding a GP mixture posterior with enhanced expressiveness for the sought function. Acquisition of the next evaluation input using this EGP-based function posterior is then enabled by Thompson sampling (TS) that requires no additional design parameters. To endow function sampling with scalability, random feature-based kernel approximation is leveraged per GP model. The novel EGP-TS readily accommodates parallel operation. To further establish convergence of the proposed EGP-TS to the global optimum, analysis is conducted based on the notion of Bayesian regret for both sequential and parallel settings. Tests on synthetic functions and real-world applications showcase the merits of the proposed method.

AB Developing autonomous driving models through reinforcement learning is gaining widespread prominence. However, a pervasive problem is developing obstacle avoidance systems. Specifically, optimizing path completion times while avoiding objects is an underdeveloped area of research. AWS DeepRacer's platform provides a powerful architecture for engineering and analyzing autonomous models. Using AWS DeepRacer, we integrate two pathfinding algorithms, A* and Line-of-Sight (LoS), into this paradigm of autonomous driving. LoS is a novel algorithm that incrementally updates the model's heading angles to amply reach its destination. We trained three types of models: Centerline, A*, and LoS. The Centerline model utilizes logic from AWS and is practically the only model used by the AWS DeepRacer community that avoids objects. We developed models from A* and LoS that outperformed the default models in time per lap while maintaining commensurate stability.

AB The Great Salt Lake reached the lowest water volume in its entire 170+ year record in 2022. To explain this record low we develop and apply a lake mass-balance model and perform four simulations: one where all input and output variables are fixed to their mid-20th century average resulting in an equilibrium lake volume, and three others where one of the input variables (precipitation or streamflow) or the output variable (evaporation) follows observations while the other two are fixed to their mid-20th century average. Results show anomalously low streamflow accounting for the largest proportion of the lake volume departure from the equilibrium state by 2022, resulting in about three times the additional water loss over 1950-2022 as increasing evaporation, which played the second largest role. Precipitation changes played a minimal role. Though streamflow had a greater effect, the lake would not have reached the record low volume without increasing evaporation.

AB Online reviews play a crucial role in influencing seller-customer dynamics. This research evaluates the credibility and consistency of reviews based on volume, length, and content to understand the impacts of incentives on customer review behaviors, how to improve review quality, and decision-making in purchases. The data analysis reveals major factors such as costs, support, usability, and product features that may influence the impact. The analysis also highlights the indirect impact of company size, the direct impact of user experience, and the varying impacts of changing conditions over the years on the volume of incentive reviews. This study uses methodologies such as Sentence-BERT (SBERT), TF-IDF, spectral clustering, t-SNE, A/B testing, hypothesis testing, and bootstrap distribution to investigate how semantic variances in reviews could be used for personalized shopping experiences. It reveals that incentive reviews have minimal to no impact on purchasing decisions, which is consistent with the credibility and consistency analysis in terms of volume, length, and content. The negligible impact of incentive reviews on purchase decisions underscores the importance of authentic online feedback. This research clarifies how review characteristics sway consumer choices and provides strategic insights for businesses to enhance their review mechanisms and customer engagement.

AB Dynamics of many complex systems, from weather and climate to spread of infectious diseases, can be described by partial differential equations (PDEs). Such PDEs involve unknown function(s), partial derivatives, and typically multiple independent variables. The traditional numerical methods for solving PDEs assume that the data are observed on a regular grid. However, in many applications data records are irregularly spaced. Furthermore, in problems involving prediction analytics such as forecasting wildfire smoke plumes, the primary focus may be on a set of irregular locations associated with urban development. In recent years, deep learning (DL) methods and, in particular, graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a new promising tool that can complement traditional PDE solvers in scenarios of the irregular spaced data, contributing to the newest research trend of physics informed machine learning (PIML). However, most existing PIML methods tend to be limited in their ability to describe higher dimensional structural properties exhibited by real world phenomena, especially, ones that live on manifolds. To address this fundamental challenge, we bring the elements of the Hodge theory and, in particular, simplicial convolution defined on the Hodge Laplacian to the emerging nexus of DL and PDEs. Contrary to conventional Laplacian and the associated convolution operation, the simplicial convolution allows us to rigorously describe diffusion across higher order structures and to better approximate the complex underlying topology and geometry of the data. The new approach, Simplicial Neural Networks for Partial Differential Equations (SNN PDE) offers a computationally efficient yet effective solution for time dependent PDEs. Our studies of synthetic data and wildfire processes show that SNN PDE improves upon state of the art baselines in handling unstructured grids and irregular time intervals of complex physical systems and offers competitive forecasting capabilities for weather and air quality forecasting.

AB Despite the promising performance of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents in many challenging scenarios, the black-box nature of these agents greatly limits their applications in critical domains. Prior research has proposed several explanation techniques to understand the deep learning-based policies in RL. Most existing methods explain why an agent takes individual actions rather than pinpointing the critical steps to its final reward. To fill this gap, we propose StateMask, a novel method to identify the states most critical to the agent's final reward. The high-level idea of StateMask is to learn a mask net that blinds a target agent and forces it to take random actions at some steps without compromising the agent's performance. Through careful design, we can theoretically ensure that the masked agent performs similarly to the original agent. We evaluate StateMask in various popular RL environments and show its superiority over existing explainers in explanation fidelity. We also show that StateMask has better utilities, such as launching adversarial attacks and patching policy errors.

AB Server-level power monitoring in data centers can significantly contribute to its efficient management. Nevertheless, due to the cost of a dedicated power meter for each server, most data center power management only focuses on UPS or cluster-level power monitoring. In this paper, we propose a low-cost novel power monitoring approach that uses only one sensor to extract power consumption information of all servers. We utilize the conducted electromagnetic interference (EMI) of server power supplies to measure their power consumption from non-intrusive single-point voltage measurements. We present a theoretical characterization of conducted EMI generation in server power supply and its propagation through the data center power network. Using a set of ten commercial-grade servers (six Dell PowerEdge and four Lenovo ThinkSystem), we demonstrate that our approach can estimate each server's power consumption with less than similar to 7% mean absolute error.

AB Privacy engineering encompasses various methodologies and tools, including privacy strategies and privacy patterns, aimed at achieving systems that inherently respect privacy. Despite the collection of numerous privacy patterns, their practical application remains under-explored. This paper investigates the applicability of privacy patterns in the context of robotaxis, a use case in the broader Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) ecosystem. Using the LINDDUN framework for privacy threat elicitation, we analyze existing privacy patterns to address identified privacy threats. Our findings reveal challenges in applying these patterns due to inconsistencies and a lack of guidance, as well as a lack of suitable privacy patterns for addressing several privacy threats. To fill the gaps, we propose ideas for new privacy patterns.

TI General-relativistic gauge-invariant magnetic helicity transport: Basic
   formulation and application to neutron star mergers
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
LA English
DT Article
ID MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMICS; FIELDS
AB Dynamo processes are ubiquitous in astrophysical systems. In relativistic astrophysical systems, such as accretion disks around black holes or neutron stars, they may critically affect the launching of winds and jets that can power electromagnetic emission. Dynamo processes are governed by several microscopic parameters, one of them being magnetic helicity. As a conserved quantity in nonresistive plasmas, magnetic helicity is transported across the system. One important implication of helicity conservation is, that in the absence of helicity fluxes some mean-field dynamos can be quenched, potentially affecting the large-scale evolution of the magnetic field. One of the major challenges in computing magnetic helicity is the need to fix a meaningful electromagnetic gauge. We here present a fully covariant formulation of magnetic helicity transport in general-relativistic plasmas based on the concept of relative helicity by Berger and Field and Finn and Antonsen. This formulation is separately invariant under gauge-transformation of the Maxwell and Einstein equations. As an application of this new formalism we present the first analysis of magnetic helicity transport in the merger of two neutron stars. We demonstrate the presence of global helicity fluxes into the outer layers of the stellar merger remnant, which may impact subsequent large-scale dynamo amplification in these regions.

TI Spin scattering and Hall effects in monolayer

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B

DT Article
ID TOTAL-ENERGY CALCULATIONS; WAVE; METALS
AB We theoretically show that the carrier transport in a monolayer Fe3GeTe2 experiences a transition between anomalous and spin Hall effects when the spin polarization of disorders switches between out-of-plane and in-plane. These Hall effects are allowed when the magnetization is polarized in-plane, breaking the C-3 rotation symmetry. The transition originates from the selection rule of spin scattering, the strong spin-orbit coupling, and the van Hove singularities near the Fermi surface. The scattering selection rule tolerates the sign change of the disorder spin, which provides a convenient method to detect the switching of antiferromagnetic insulators regardless of the interfacial roughness in a heterostructure. This provides a convenient platform for the study of 2D spintronics through various van der Waals heterostructures.

AB Multimodal spatiotemporal data (MST) consists of multiple simultaneous spatiotemporal modalities that interact with each other in a dynamic manner. Due to the complexity of MST and the recent desire for the explainability of artificial intelligent systems, disentangled representation learning for MST (DisentMST) has become a significant task, which aims to learn disentangled representations that can expose the underlying spatial semantics, temporal dynamic patterns, and inter-modality interaction modes of the complex MST. One limitation of existing approaches is that they might fail to tolerate the real-world incomplete MST data, where missing information might break the cross-modal spatiotemporal dynamics and bring noise and ambiguity to the learning process. Another limitation is that no existing work systematically reveals the structure of different types of disentangled information. To tackle the two limitations, we define a novel two-level hierarchically structured disentanglement task for MST, which reveals informative and structured disentangled representations for MST as well as digests the real-world MST with incompleteness. We propose a new framework, BiDisentMST, which leverages Gaussian Processes and Graph Factorization on the latent space to achieve our purposes. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework compared with baselines with respect to disentanglement and imputation results.

AB Finding connected components is a fundamental problem in graph and network analysis. It also serves as a subroutine in other graph problems. There are efficient sequential algorithms for finding connected components in a graph. However, a sequential algorithm can take a long time for a large graph. Parallel algorithms can significantly speed up computation using multiple processors. This paper presents a fast shared-memory parallel algorithm named ALZI (Afforest with LinkJump and Zero Implant) to find connected components in a graph. ALZI is an improvement of a recent state-of-the-art parallel algorithm called Afforest. We propose a few non-trivial optimizations that result in better performance in terms of runtime and scalability. We performed rigorous experimentation using a wide variety of real-world and artificial graphs to evaluate the performance of ALZI. The experimental results show that ALZI is 1.4-2.3 times faster than Afforest on these graphs and provides better scalability than Afforest. ALZI has the ability to work with very large graphs. On a Kronecker graph with 4.2 billion edges, ALZI can find the connected components in just 1.02 s using 128 processors.

AB Transdisciplinarity is identified as an important paradigm to cope with the complexity of societal problems, such as public health crisis and climate change. It refers to problem solving and research strategies that integrate the knowledge from diverse disciplines to ensure a holistic approach. In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, emergency management organizations are increasingly incorporating serious games to enhance their preparedness and readiness activities. While some serious games have been used within wider transdisciplinary studies, literature reviews show that the games themselves do not exhibit a sufficient degree of transdisciplinarity. In this paper we present the theoretical approach we introduced to support the integration of transdisciplinary knowledge into the design and development of SGs looking at socially relevant problems (i.e., decision-making during epidemic outbreaks) and we show how we applied the proposed framework to design the Command, Control, Coordination, and Communication (C3C) Game. Finally, we describe the positive results from a pilot exercise conducted using the C3C Game with public health, healthcare coalition and emergency response decision makers from a large US metropolitan area.

AB Hurricane Ike, which struck the United States in September 2008, was the ninth most expensive hurricane in terms of damages. It caused nearly USD 30 billion in damage after making landfall on the Bolivar Peninsula, Texas. We used the Delft3d-FM/SWAN hydrodynamic and spectral wave model to simulate the storm surge inundation around Galveston Bay during Hurricane Ike. Damage curves were established through the relationship between eight hydrodynamic parameters (water depth, flow velocity, unit discharge, flow momentum flux, significant wave height, wave energy flux, total water depth (flow depth plus wave height), and total (flow plus wave) force) simulated by the model and National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) insurance damage data. The NFIP insurance database contains a large amount of building damage data, building stories, and elevation, as well as other information from the Ike event. We found that the damage curves are sensitive to the model grid resolution, building elevation, and the number of stories. We also found that the resulting damage functions are steeper than those developed for residential structures in many other locations.

AB Supporting humans and artificial intelligence (AI) machines as teammates in flood evacuation decisions relies on a carefully designed system with the capability for monitoring, analyzing, responding, and executing. In this context, research is needed to improve the integration of human knowledge into the AI machines. The goal is to achieve trusting partnerships between humans and machines that allow them to communicate, coordinate, and work effectively as a team. Further, methods for supporting transparency and explainability in future AI system design need to consider incorporating different types of human data (e.g., social media data, collected citizen knowledge, and stakeholder input) in the loop particularly as these factors relate to dynamically changing flood evacuation situations. This commentary lays out the rationale for human-AI teaming (HAT) systems in the context of flood evacuation decision making.

AB There has been growing concern regarding data privacy during the development and deployment of Multimodal Foundation Models for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), while Federated Learning (FL) allows multiple clients to collaboratively train models in a privacy-preserving manner. This paper formulates and studies Modality-task Agnostic Federated Learning (AFL) to pave the way toward privacy-preserving AGI. A unique property of AFL is the asymmetrical knowledge relationships among clients due to modality gaps, task gaps, and domain shifts between clients. This raises a challenge in learning an optimal inter-client information-sharing scheme that maximizes positive transfer and minimizes negative transfer for AFL. However, prior FL methods, mostly focusing on symmetrical knowledge transfer, tend to exhibit insufficient positive transfer and fail to fully avoid negative transfer during inter-client collaboration. To address this issue, we propose DisentAFL, which leverages a two-stage Knowledge Disentanglement and Gating mechanism to explicitly decompose the original asymmetrical inter-client information-sharing scheme into several independent symmetrical inter-client information-sharing schemes, each of which corresponds to certain semantic knowledge type learned from the local tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method on AFL than baselines.

AB Label Distribution Learning (LDL), as a more general learning setting than generic single-label and multi-label learning, has been commonly used in computer vision and many other applications. To date, existing LDL approaches are designed and applied to data without considering the interdependence between instances. In this paper, we propose a Graph Label Distribution Learning (GLDL) framework, which explicitly models three types of relationships: instance-instance, label-label, and instance-label, to learn the label distribution for networked data. A label-label network is learned to capture label-to-label correlation, through which GLDL can accurately learn label distributions for nodes. Dual graph convolution network (GCN) Co-training with heterogeneous message passing ensures two GCNs, one focusing on instanceinstance relationship and the other one targeting label-label correlation, are jointly trained such that instance-instance relationship can help induce label-label correlation and vice versa. Our theoretical study derives the error bound of GLDL. For verification, four benchmark datasets with label distributions for nodes are created using common graph benchmarks. The experiments show that considering dependency helps learn better label distributions for networked data, compared to state-of-the-art LDL baseline. In addition, GLDL not only outperforms simple GCN and graph attention networks (GAT) using distribution loss but is also superior to its variant considering label-label relationship as a static network. GLDL and its benchmarks are the first research endeavors to address LDL for graphs. Code and benchmark data are released for public access.

AB Phononic resonators are becoming increasingly important in quantum information science, both for applications in quantum computing, communication, and sensing as well as in experiments investigating fundamental physics. Here, we study the decoherence of phonons confined in a surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonator strongly coupled (g/2 pi approximate to 9 MHz) to a superconducting transmon qubit. By comparing experimental data with numerical solutions to the Markovian master equation, we report a surface phononic energy decay rate of kappa 1/2 pi = 480 kHz and a pure dephasing rate of kappa phi /2 pi = 180 kHz. These rates are in good agreement with the level of decoherence we extract from qubit-assisted spectroscopic measurements of the SAW resonator. We additionally find that the timescales over which coherent driven dynamics and decoherence occur are comparable, highlighting the need to model the composite device as an open quantum system. We discuss possible sources of decoherence in SAW-based quantum acoustic devices and the application of these devices in future quantum acoustic dissipation engineering experiments. The decoherence characterization techniques we employ are broadly applicable for investigating and benchmarking the effects of loss and dephasing on mechanical resonators in the quantum regime.

AB Dearomative cycloadditions offer rapid access to complex 3D molecular architectures, commonly via a sp(2)-to-sp(3) rehybridization of two atoms of an aromatic ring. Here we report that the 6e pi-system of a benzenoid aromatic pendant could be exhaustively depleted within a single photochemical cascade. An implementation of this approach involves the initial dearomative [4+2] cycloaddition of the Excited State Intramolecular Proton Transfer (ESIPT)-generated azaxylylene, followed by two consecutive [2+2] cycloadditions of auxiliary pi moieties strategically positioned in the photoprecursor. Such photochemical cascade fully dearomatizes the benzenoid aromatic ring, saturating all six sp(2) atoms to yield a complex sp(3)-rich scaffold with high control of its 3D molecular shape, rendering it a robust platform for rapid systematic mapping of underexplored chemical space. Significant growth of molecular complexity-starting with a modular synthesis of photoprecursors from readily available building blocks-is quantified by Bottcher score calculations.

AB Thermal decomposition and isomerization of 1-butyl and 1-pentyl radical were studied in the temperature range of 500-1480 K on a short time scale of 20-100 mu s using flash pyrolysis vacuum ultraviolet single-photon ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. 1-Bromobutane and 1-bromopentane were used as precursors for the 1-butyl and 1-pentyl radical, respectively. The reactive intermediates in the thermal dissociation reactions were directly observed. The 1-butyl radical decomposed to ethene and ethyl radical with ethyl radical rapidly losing an H atom to form a second ethene molecule. Loss of H atom from butyl radical was also a significant decomposition channel. Isomerization of 1-butyl via 1,3-H migration was observed as a minor channel at 1380 K and above with a branching ratio of less than 3% at 1430 K. The 1-pentyl radical was observed to decompose mainly by isomerization to 2-pentyl radical followed by beta-scission to produce propene and ethyl radicals at temperatures approximately 900 K and below. Above 900 K, beta-scission of 1-pentyl to produce ethene and 1-propyl radical became increasingly important. Isomerization to 3-pentyl was verified to be a minor channel.

AB Labeled data can be expensive to acquire in several application domains, including medical imaging, robotics, computer vision and wireless networks to list a few. To efficiently train machine learning models under such high labeling costs, active learning (AL) judiciously selects the most informative data instances to label on-the-fly. This active sampling process can benefit from a statistical function model, that is typically captured by a Gaussian process (GP) with well-documented merits especially in the regression task. While most GP-based AL approaches rely on a single kernel function, the present contribution advocates an ensemble of GP (EGP) models with weights adapted to the labeled data collected incrementally. Building on this novel EGP model, a suite of acquisition functions emerges based on the uncertainty and disagreement rules. An adaptively weighted ensemble of EGP-based acquisition functions is advocated to further robustify performance. Extensive tests on synthetic and real datasets in the regression task showcase the merits of the proposed EGP-based approaches with respect to the single GP-based AL alternatives.

AB Two-dimensional graphitic metal-organic frameworks (GMOF) often display impressive electrical conductivity chiefly due to efficient through-bond in-plane charge transport, however, less efficient out-of-plane conduction across the stacked layers creates large disparity between two orthogonal conduction pathways and dampens their bulk conductivity. To address this issue and engineer higher bulk conductivity in 2D GMOFs, we have constructed via an elegant bottom-up method the first p-intercalated GMOF (iGMOF1) featuring built-in alternate p-donor/acceptor (p-D/A) stacks of Cu-II-coordinated electron-rich hexaaminotriphenylene (HATP) ligands and non-coordinatively intercalated p-acidic hexacyano-triphenylene (HCTP) molecules, which facilitated out-of-plane charge transport while the hexagonal Cu-3(HATP)(2) scaffold maintained in-plane conduction. As a result, iGMOF1 attained an order of magnitude higher bulk electrical conductivity and much smaller activation energy than Cu-3(HATP)(2) (s=25 vs. 2 S m(-1), E-a=36 vs. 65 meV), demostrating that simultaneous in-plane (through-bond) and out-of-plane (through pD/A stacks) charge transport can generate higher electrical conductivity in novel iGMOFs.

AB Automating configuration is the key path to achieving zero-touch network management in ever-complicating mobile networks. Deep learning techniques show great potential to automatically learn and tackle high-dimensional networking problems. The vulnerability of deep learning to deviated input space, however, raises increasing deployment concerns under unpredictable variabilities and simulation-to-reality discrepancy in real-world networks. In this paper, we propose a novel RoNet framework to improve the robustness of neural-assisted configuration policies. We formulate the network configuration problem to maximize performance efficiency when serving diverse user applications. We design three integrated stages with novel normal training, learn-to-attack, and robust defense method for balancing the robustness and performance of policies. We evaluate RoNet via the NS-3 simulator extensively and the simulation results show that RoNet outperforms existing solutions in terms of robustness, adaptability, and scalability.

AB The molecular level characterization of complex mixtures remains an analytical challenge. We have shown that the integration of complementary, high-resolution, gas-phase separations allows for chemical formula level isomeric content description. In the current work, we revisited the current challenges associated with the analysis of dissolved organic matter using high-resolution trapped ion mobility separation (TIMS) and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS). In particular, we evaluated the separation capabilities provided by TIMS-MS compared to MS alone, the use of ICR complementary data acquisition (DAQ) systems and transient processing strategies, ICR cell geometries (e.g., Infinity cell vs harmonized cell), and magnetic field strengths (7 T vs 9.4 T vs 21 T) for the case of a Harney River DOM sample. Results showed that the external high-performance DAQ enables direct representation of mass spectra in absorption mode FT (aFT), doubling the MS resolution compared to the default magnitude mode FT (mFT). Changes between half- vs full-apodization result in greater MS signal/noise vs superior MS resolving power (RP); in the case of DOM analysis, a 45% increase in assigned formulas is observed when employing the DAQ half (Kaiser-type)-apodization window and aFT when compared to the default instrument mFT. Results showed the advantages of reprocessing 2D-TIMS-FT-ICR MS data with higher RP and magnetic field chemical formulas generated list acquired (e.g., 21 T led to a 24% increase in isomers reported) or the implementation of alternative strategies.

AB Motivated by some variational problems from a nonlocal model of mechanics, this work presents a set of sufficient conditions that guarantee a compact inclusion in the function space of L-p vector fields defined on a domain Omega that is either a bounded domain in R-d or R-d itself. The criteria are nonlocal and are given with respect to nonlocal interaction kernels that may not be necessarily radially symmetric. Moreover, these criteria for vector fields are also different from those given for scalar fields in that the conditions are based on nonlocal interactions involving only parts of the components of the vector fields. The L-p compactness criteria are utilized in demonstrating the convergence of minimizers of parameterized nonlocal energy functionals.

AB Generating realistic simulations is critical for autonomous system applications such as self-driving and human-robot interactions. However, driving simulators nowadays still have difficulty in generating controllable, diverse, and rule-compliant behaviors for road participants: Rule-based models cannot produce diverse behaviors and require careful tuning, whereas learning-based methods imitate the policy from data but are not designed to follow the rules explicitly. Besides, the real-world datasets are by nature "single-outcome", making the learning method hard to generate diverse behaviors. In this letter, we leverage Signal Temporal Logic (STL) and Diffusion Models to learn controllable, diverse, and rule-aware policy. We first calibrate the STL on the real-world data, then generate diverse synthetic data using trajectory optimization, and finally learn the rectified diffusion policy on the augmented dataset. We test on the NuScenes dataset and our approach can achieve the most diverse rule-compliant trajectories compared to other baselines, with a runtime 1/17X to the second-best approach. In the closed-loop testing, our approach reaches the highest diversity, rule satisfaction rate, and the least collision rate. Our method can generate varied characteristics conditional on different STL parameters in testing. A case study on human-robot encounter scenarios shows our approach can generate diverse and closed-to-oracle trajectories.

AB Efforts to bring incarcerated and formerly incarcerated individuals into the field of computing stand to improve equitable access to both computing jobs, and consequently the benefits of our tools and innovations through the inclusion of more diverse perspectives. This report describes the design and execution of a college level introductory computing course conducted with 26 students currently incarcerated at a prison in the United States in Fall 2022. We discuss the ways that the prison environment and the student body differ from traditional college computing classes, and how this impacted the design and execution of the course. We found that despite significant environmental barriers to learning to program, such as not having access to a code interpreter, there were unique affordances of the student population, including maturity and community, that could be leveraged in the course design and policies. We conclude with many lessons learned for the purpose of improving future offerings of computing courses in prisons.

AB Photo-predissociation of SH and SD radicals in the A(2)sigma(+) state is investigated using the high-n Rydberg atom time-of-flight technique. By measuring the photoproduct translational energy distributions as a function of excitation wavelength, contributions from overlapping A(2)sigma(+) (v') <- X-2 Pi (v '') transitions can be separated, and the H/D + S(P-3(J)) photofragment yield (PFY) spectra are obtained across various rovibrational levels (SH v' = 0-7 and SD v' = 0-8) of the A(2)sigma(+) <- X-2 Pi bands. The upper A(2)sigma(+) state vibrational levels v' = 5-7 of SH and v' = 3-8 of SD are determined for the first time. The PFY spectra are analyzed with the simulation program PGOPHER [C. M. Western, J. Quant. Spectrosc. Radiat. Transfer 186, 221 (2016)], which gives vibrational origins and linewidths of the rovibrational levels of the A(2)sigma(+) state. The linewidths (>= 1.5 cm(-1)) of the SH A(2)sigma(+) v' = 3-7 and SD A(2)sigma(+) v' = 2-8 states are characterized for the first time in this work, demonstrating that these levels undergo rapid predissociation with lifetimes on the order of picosecond. The lifetimes of the SD A(2)sigma(+) v' = 0, N' = 1 and 2 levels are determined to be 247 +/- 50 ns and 176 +/- 60 ns by pump-probe delay measurements, respectively. The experimentally measured lifetimes are in reasonable agreement with the theoretical predictions. Published under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing.

ID MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; STRESS-RELAXATION; POLYMER
AB The presence of dynamic covalent bonds allows vitrimers to undergo topology alterations and display self-healing properties. Herein, we study the influence of varying the concentration of dynamic bonds on the macroscopic properties of hybrid vitrimer networks by subjecting them to triaxial stretching tests using molecular simulations. Results show that the presence of dynamic bonds allows for continuous stress relaxation in the hybrid networks leading to delayed craze development and higher stretching as compared to permanently crosslinked networks. The work highlights the ability of glassy vitrimer networks to relax tensile stress during deformation successfully.
   The presence of varying concentrations of dynamic linkages in hybrid vitrimer networks facilitates stress relaxation and delayed crazing while also improving creep resistance.

TI Solubility of 2,5-Furandicarboxylic Acid in Pure and Mixed Organic
   Solvent Systems at 293 K Predicted Using Hansen Solubility Parameters
SO ACS OMEGA
LA English
DT Article
AB Central to the production of polyethylene furanoate (PEF), a bioplastic that could potentially replace petroleum-derived plastics, is 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). FDCA is a chemical derived from biomass that has low solubility in traditionally used solvents such as water. Thus, identifying solvents that can solubilize significant amounts of FDCA could allow for lower PEF production costs. In this study, FDCA solubility was investigated in nine pure solvents including H2O, acetonitrile (ACN), gamma-valerolactone (GVL), gamma-butyrolactone (GBL), ethanol (EtOH), methanol (MeOH), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), sulfolane (SULF), and tetrahydrofuran (THF), eight binary, and three ternary solvent blends at 293 K. For all binary systems excluding DMSO and MeOH, the solubility of FDCA increased 1.5-65 times compared to the pure organic solvent, and the FDCA solubility was at least 10 times higher when compared to pure water. Specifically, the 20/80 w/w H2O/DMSO system solubilized 23.1 wt % FDCA, the highest of any binary blend studied, and 190 times more solubility than in pure water. In 20/80 w/w H2O/THF, the FDCA solubility was 60 times higher than pure water. In ternary blends that included DMSO, H2O, and either GVL, THF, or SULF, solubility increased by at least 6.6 times relative to the pure secondary organic component and 54 times relative to pure water. Using Hansen solubility parameters (HSPs), the radius of interaction (R-i,R- j) was found to be more strongly correlated to FDCA solubility than individual HSPs or the total solubility parameter. A MATLAB-based optimization code was developed and successful in minimizing the R-i,R- j of a solvent blend to maximize FDCA solubility in binary and ternary aqueous solvents.

AB Several linear correlation equations are derived from the classical solution-diffusion theory and applied to analyze over 100 experimental datasets collected under constant and sinusoidally varying feed flows and pressures. While the theory provides reasonable predictions for water flux, it fails to accurately model permeate concentration, particularly in cases of membrane degradation. Incorporating convective transport over a small portion of the membrane successfully captures the recovery rate and permeate quality across all scenarios studied (R2 >= 0.99). This enhanced model, with only three parameters, holds significant potential for advancing future membrane transport modeling efforts.

AB A partial differential equation (PDE) constrained design optimization problem usually optimizes a characteristic of a dynamical system around an equilibrium point. However, a commonly omitted constraint is the linear stability constraint at the equilibrium point, which undermines the optimized solution's applicability. To enforce the linear stability constraint in practical gradient-based optimization, the derivatives must be computed accurately, and their computational cost must scale favorably with the number of design variables. In this paper, we propose an algorithm based on the coupled adjoint method and the algorithmic differentiation method that can compute the derivative of such constraint accurately and efficiently. We verify the proposed method using several simple low-dimensional dynamical systems. The relative difference between the adjoint method and the finite differences is between 10-6 to 10-8. The proposed method is demonstrated through several optimizations, including a nonlinear aeroelastic optimization. The proposed algorithm has the potential to be applied to more complex problems involving large-scale nonlinear PDEs, such as aircraft flutter and buffet suppression.

TI Scaling dimension of the 4π-flux monopole operator in four-flavor
   three-dimensional QED using lattice simulation
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
LA English
DT Article
ID CHIRAL-SYMMETRY-BREAKING
AB We numerically address the issue of which monopole operators are relevant under renormalization group flow in three-dimensional parity-invariant noncompact QED with four flavors of massless two-component Dirac fermion. Using lattice simulation and finite-size scaling analysis of the free energy to introduce monopole-antimonopole pairs in N = 4 and N = 12 flavor noncompact QED3, we estimate the infrared scaling dimensions of monopole operators that introduce 2g and 4g fluxes around them. We first show that the estimates for the monopole scaling dimensions are consistent with the large-N expectations for N = 12 QED3. Applying the same procedure in N = 4 QED3, we estimate the scaling dimension of 4g flux monopole operator to be 3.7(3), which allows the possibility of the operator being irrelevant. This finding offers support to the scenario in which higher-flux monopoles are irrelevant deformations to the Dirac spin liquid phase that could be realized on certain non-bipartite lattices by forbidding 2g-flux monopoles.

AB Although useful to extract excitation energies of states of double-excitation character in time-dependent density functional theory that are missing in the adiabatic approximation, the frequency-dependent kernel derived earlier [Maitra et al., J. Chem. Phys. 120, 5932 (2004)] was not designed to yield oscillator strengths. These are required to fully determine linear absorption spectra, and they also impact excited-to-excited-state couplings that appear in dynamics simulations and other quadratic response properties. Here, we derive a modified non-adiabatic kernel that yields both accurate excitation energies and oscillator strengths for these states. We demonstrate its performance on a model two-electron system, the Be atom, and on excited-state transition dipoles in the LiH molecule at stretched bond-lengths, in all cases producing significant improvements over the traditional approximations.

AB Tensor time series, which is a time series consisting of tensorial observations, has become ubiquitous. It typically exhibits high dimensionality. One approach for dimension reduction is to use a factor model structure, in a form similar to Tucker tensor decomposition, except that the time dimension is treated as a dynamic process with a time dependent structure. In this paper, we introduce two approaches to estimate such a tensor factor model by using iterative orthogonal projections of the original tensor time series. These approaches extend the existing estimation procedures and improve the estimation accuracy and convergence rate significantly as proven in our theoretical investigation. Our algorithms are similar to the higher-order orthogonal projection method for tensor decomposition, but with significant differences due to the need to unfold tensors in the iterations and the use of autocorrelation. Consequently, our analysis is significantly different from the existing ones. Computational and statistical lower bounds are derived to prove the optimality of the sample size requirement and convergence rate for the proposed methods. Simulation study is conducted to further illustrate the statistical properties of these estimators.

AB Electric Vehicles (EVs) are being widely adopted as a green alternative to fossil-based vehicles. However, the current charging infrastructure for EVs is inadequate to meet the growing charge demand. Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) charging offers a promising solution that enables a charge supplier EV to provide charging services to a charge demander EV in a distributed manner. Nevertheless, V2V matching and charge scheduling can disclose sensitive location information about the drivers, such as their whereabouts and driving patterns. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving scheme for centralized optimal matching of demander EVs with supplier EVs, while protecting their sensitive information. In our scheme, charge demanders report to a matching server their encrypted location information and the requested energy quantities, whereas charge suppliers report encrypted charge costs such that the matching server can learn only the cost to match each demander to each supplier without revealing any location information or the exchanged charge amount. Then, the Hungarian algorithm is used to match demanders to suppliers while minimizing the total cost. The security analysis and simulation results show that our scheme can achieve optimal V2V matching while preserving drivers' privacy with negligible computation overhead. Overall, our proposed scheme provides an effective solution for V2V charging, while maintaining privacy and confidentiality of sensitive drivers' information.

AB The current method to synthesize urea is highly energy-intensive and has a massive carbon footprint. The electrochemical synthesis of urea from NO3- and CO2 is an attractive and sustainable approach, as renewable energy can be used to synthesize green urea under ambient conditions by utilizing waste NO3- and CO2 from the air or flue gas. In this work, we conducted a thorough catalytic screening of various metal-based catalysts. When the Ag GDE was used as a working electrode, similar to 100% urea faradaic efficiency and similar to-100 mA cm(-2) of urea current density were observed at -1.2 V vs. RHE. FTIR analysis further confirmed the formation of urea and the presence of *CO intermediates. Through DFT studies, excellent kinetics and selectivity toward urea on Ag were explained by a combination of the facile first and second C-N bond-formation steps and an endergonic (Delta G > 1.5 eV) formamide (HCONH2) formation from *CONH2 step.

AB Green superinsulation materials are essential for net-zero sustainable building envelopes. Realizing such potential is indispensable for simultaneously achieving carbon-sequestration and superinsulation performance. Here, we report the synthesis of a water glass-based silica aerogel exhibiting a thermal conductivity of 17.2 mW/m<middle dot>K and a high porosity of 92%. We used carbon-sequestration wheat straw fiber to create a gradient cellulose-aerogel composite to improve mechanical stability. The as-prepared gradient composite exhibits a thermal conductivity of 27.1 mW/m<middle dot>K and a flexural modulus of 824 MPa, while exhibiting superhydrophobicity (water contact angle of 135.4 degrees) for the development of green building insulation materials.

SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID CLASSIFICATION
AB Accurate prediction of reaction yield is the holy grail for computer-assisted synthesis prediction, but current models have failed to generalize to large literature datasets. To understand the causes and inspire future design, we systematically benchmarked the yield prediction task. We carefully curated and augmented a literature dataset of 41 239 amide coupling reactions, each with information on reactants, products, intermediates, yields, and reaction contexts, and provided 3D structures for the molecules. We calculated molecular features related to 2D and 3D structure information, as well as physical and electronic properties. These descriptors were paired with 4 categories of machine learning methods (linear, kernel, ensemble, and neural network), yielding valuable benchmarks about feature and model performance. Despite the excellent performance on a high-throughput experiment (HTE) dataset (R2 around 0.9), no method gave satisfactory results on the literature data. The best performance was an R2 of 0.395 +/- 0.020 using the stack technique. Error analysis revealed that reactivity cliff and yield uncertainty are among the main reasons for incorrect predictions. Removing reactivity cliffs and uncertain reactions boosted the R2 to 0.457 +/- 0.006. These results highlight that yield prediction models must be sensitive to the reactivity change due to the subtle structure variance, as well as be robust to the uncertainty associated with yield measurements.
   A sensitive model captures the reactivity cliffs but overfit to yield outliers. On the other hand, a robust model disregards the yield outliers but underfits the reactivity cliffs.

AB The classification of variable objects provides insight into a wide variety of astrophysics ranging from stellar interiors to galactic nuclei. The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) provides time-series observations that record the variability of more than a billion sources. The scale of these data necessitates automated approaches to make a thorough analysis. Building on previous work, this paper reports the results of the ZTF Source Classification Project (SCoPe), which trains neural network and XGBoost (XGB) machine-learning (ML) algorithms to perform dichotomous classification of variable ZTF sources using a manually constructed training set containing 170,632 light curves. We find that several classifiers achieve high precision and recall scores, suggesting the reliability of their predictions for 209,991,147 light curves across 77 ZTF fields. We also identify the most important features for XGB classification and compare the performance of the two ML algorithms, finding a pattern of higher precision among XGB classifiers. The resulting classification catalog is available to the public, and the software developed for SCoPe is open source and adaptable to future time-domain surveys.

AB A minimal number of rigid constraints makes soft robots versatile, but many of these robots use soft pneumatic actuators (SPAs) designed to inflate through a single trajectory. In an unloaded actuator, this trajectory is dictated by the arrangement of in-extensible and elastic materials. External strain limiters can be added post-fabrication to SPAs, but these are passive devices. In this paper, we offer design and control techniques for an electrically active strain limiter that is easily adhered to existing SPAs to provide signal-controlled force output. These sheathed electroadhesive (EA) clutches apply antagonistic forces through the constitutive properties of their silicone sheathing and through the variable friction of the clutch itself. We are able to design the sheathing to passively support loads or minimize passive stiffness. We control clutch forces via an augmented pulse-width-modulation (PWM) of the high voltage square-wave input. We perform an initial, empirical characterization on the system with tensile material testing. The clutch system resists motion with sustained forces ranging from 0.5N to 22N. We then demonstrate its ability to apply predictable nonconservative work in a dynamic catching task, where it can limit catching height from 15cm to 1cm. Finally, we attach it to an inverse pneumatic artificial muscle (IPAM) to show that variable strain limitation can control position of the SPA endpoint.

AB Very metal-poor stars ([Fe/H] < -2) in the Milky Way are fossil records of early chemical evolution and the assembly and structure of the Galaxy. However, they are rare and hard to find. Gaia DR3 has provided over 200 million low-resolution (R approximate to 50) XP spectra, which provides an opportunity to greatly increase the number of candidate metal-poor stars. In this work, we utilize the XGBoost classification algorithm to identify similar to 200 000 very metal-poor star candidates. Compared to past work, we increase the candidate metal-poor sample by about an order of magnitude, with comparable or better purity than past studies. First, we develop three classifiers for bright stars (BP < 16). They are Classifier-T (for Turn-off stars), Classifier-GC (for Giant stars with high completeness), and Classifier-GP (for Giant stars with high purity) with expected purity of 52 per cent/45 per cent/76 per cent and completeness of 32 per cent/93 per cent/66 per cent, respectively. These three classifiers obtained a total of 11 000/111 000/44 000 bright metal-poor candidates. We apply model-T and model-GP on faint stars (BP > 16) and obtain 38 000/41 000 additional metal-poor candidates with purity 29 per cent/52 per cent, respectively. We make our metal-poor star catalogues publicly available, for further exploration of the metal-poor Milky Way.

AB First -generation (FG) college students (i.e., those for whom neither parent/guardian obtained a bachelor's degree) experience more barriers in college, compared with continuing -generation students. These barriers are compounded by subtle messages from instructors that convey the idea that natural talent is necessary for success in scientific fields. In contrast, growth mindset messages communicate that ability can improve with effort, help -seeking, and using productive study strategies. In a large enrollment introductory biology course, students were randomly assigned to receive email messages from their instructor after the first two exams containing either a growth mindset or control message. The intervention improved grades in the course for everyone, on average, compared with control messages, and were especially beneficial for FG students. This increase in performance was partially mediated by increased activity accessing course materials on the course website. This study provides preliminary evidence that instructors communicating growth mindset messages can support FG students' performance.

AB This paper proposes a low-cost, penalty parameter-free, and pressure-robust Stokes solver based on the enriched Galerkin (EG) method with a discontinuous velocity enrichment function. The EG method employs the interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin (IPDG) formulation to weakly impose the continuity of the velocity function. However, despite its advantage of symmetry, the symmetric IPDG formulation requires a lot of computational effort to choose an optimal penalty parameter and compute different trace terms. To reduce such effort, we replace the derivatives of the velocity function with its weak derivatives computed by the geometric data of elements. Therefore, our modified EG (mEG) method is a penalty parameter-free numerical scheme that has reduced computational complexity and conserves the optimal convergence orders. Moreover, we achieve pressure robustness for the mEG method by employing a velocity reconstruction operator on the load vector on the right-hand side of the discrete system. The theoretical results are confirmed through numerical experiments with two- and three-dimensional examples.

AB Dual rail adiabatic circuit design offers hardware-level protection against side-channel power analysis attacks such as Differential Power Analysis (DPA) and Correlation Power Analysis (CPA) attacks. While considerable attention has been given to synthesizing logic tree-based adiabatic circuits, comparatively little attention has been given to generating truly secure circuit variants. This paper presents preliminary results for a secure dual rail adiabatic synthesis tool based on Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs). The tool demonstrates encouraging performance in matching known optimal transistor counts for several basic logic gates, in addition to providing improvement over existing works on established benchmarks.

AB The wear behavior of cutting tools is highly complex due to combined thermal, mechanical, and chemical loads. As a result, most current tool-wear prediction methodologies are either empirical or highly oversimplified analytical or numerical models of stable abrasive and diffusive wear mechanisms. To predict the complex physics of catastrophic tool edge chipping, which in practice bounds feasible process parameters, this manuscript presents a novel approach for in-situ characterization of tool edge fatigue loads and probabilistic prediction of the likelihood of time to fracture. The results of the analysis suggest encouraging possibilities for more physics-informed and data-driven process design.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB Production cloud computing systems consist of hundreds to thousands of computing and storage nodes. Such a scale, combined with ever-growing system complexity, is causing a key challenge to failure and resource management for dependable cloud computing. Efficient system monitoring and failure detection are crucial for understanding emergent, cloudwide phenomena and intelligently managing cloud resources for system-level dependability assurance and application-level performance assurance. To detect failures, we need to monitor the cloud execution and collect runtime performance data. These data are usually unlabeled at runtime in real-world systems, and thus a prior failure history is not always available. In this paper, we present a self-evolving anomaly detection framework for cloud dependability assurance. Our framework does not require any prior failure history, and it self-evolves by continuously exploring newly verified anomaly records and continuously updating the anomaly detector at runtime without expensive model retraining. A distinct advantage of our framework is that cloud system operators only need to check a small number of detected anomalies (compared with thousands-millions of system/application event records) and their decisions are leveraged to update the detector. Thus, the detector evolves following the upgrade of system hardware, update of software stack, and change of user workloads. Moreover, we design two types of detectors, one for general anomaly detection and the other for type-specific anomaly detection. Leveraging self-evolution and online learning techniques, our detectors can achieve 88.94% of sensitivity and 94.60% of specificity on average, which makes them suitable for real-world deployment.

TI CHAI: consensus clustering through similarity matrix integration for

AB Several methods have been developed to computationally predict cell-types for single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data. As methods are developed, a common problem for investigators has been identifying the best method they should apply to their specific use-case. To address this challenge, we present CHAI (consensus Clustering tHrough similArIty matrix integratIon for single cell-type identification), a wisdom of crowds approach for scRNAseq clustering. CHAI presents two competing methods which aggregate the clustering results from seven state-of-the-art clustering methods: CHAI-AvgSim and CHAI-SNF. CHAI-AvgSim and CHAI-SNF demonstrate superior performance across several benchmarking datasets. Furthermore, both CHAI methods outperform the most recent consensus clustering method, SAME-clustering. We demonstrate CHAI's practical use case by identifying a leader tumor cell cluster enriched with CDH3. CHAI provides a platform for multiomic integration, and we demonstrate CHAI-SNF to have improved performance when including spatial transcriptomics data. CHAI overcomes previous limitations by incorporating the most recent and top performing scRNAseq clustering algorithms into the aggregation framework. It is also an intuitive and easily customizable R package where users may add their own clustering methods to the pipeline, or down-select just the ones they want to use for the clustering aggregation. This ensures that as more advanced clustering algorithms are developed, CHAI will remain useful to the community as a generalized framework. CHAI is available as an open source R package on GitHub: https://github.com/lodimk2/chai.

AB Immersive virtual reality (IVR) is widely recognized as an innovative technology that enhances learning experiences. IVR affordances could serve as a learning medium, and instructors and designers should consider using available tools to teach practical STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) subjects, incorporating the latest practices and recommendations. Due to innovations in virtual reality hardware and affordability in recent years, there is a higher chance that IVR will be adopted in educational settings. Thus, designers and developers must stay informed about current IVR trends and the aspects addressed and recommended for instructing STEM concepts. To target this issue, we systematically reviewed the design and development of customized IVR experiences and their multiple effects on STEM learning settings. In this systematic review, we identified several advantages and disadvantages reported in 30 papers based on user studies in higher education scenarios. We proposed a conceptual framework to categorize the design and features of the IVR tools discussed in the papers, based on their levels of embodiment, immersion, and the type of learning they facilitate. IVR can provide an intuitive and practical immersive learning experience, reporting multiple results on motivation, engagement, usability, and learning performance. However, we should consider the features that could directly affect the user experience and learning outcomes. We recommend that designers and developers explore developing customized IVR experiences tailored for STEM learning, especially for invisible and complex subjects where 3D visualization could benefit students.

   ALLOYS; ENERGY
AB The production of extended and mechanically highly consequential defects are investigated under concurrent driving forces of irradiation and stress. By using two -temperature model to account for realistic exchange of energy between the electronic subsystem and the atomic subsystem during cascades, and by controlling mechanical loading in the principal stress space to remove the dependance on a specific coordinate system, we build stress sensitivity maps for various types of irradiated dislocations. Frank loops are discovered to be dictated by volumetric strains, while Shockley partials are sensitive to volume-conserving shear loads. By tracking the microstructural evolutions during coupled irradiation and external loading, and by scrutinizing the temporal-spatial variation of local von Mises stresses near the center-collision region, the underlying mechanisms responsible for those different responses/sensitivities are elucidated. The implications of these findings in regard to a new strategy to control microstructural defects and materials performance are also discussed.

AB Building on the literature, we designed a practical framework to support attention to equity and justice in science teacher education coursework. This framework presents four approaches for including justice moves in elementary science lessons, from increasing opportunity and access in science, to increasing identity and representation in science, to expanding what counts as science, to seeing science as a part of justice movements. We analyzed the lesson plans of 16 preservice elementary teachers who were using the practical justice framework in their very first lesson planning experience. In addition to extensive attention to varying participation structures to support children's science discourse, preservice teachers also took up more challenging moves such as attending to how children are positioned as scientists, inviting children's science ideas and hearing the science in their ideas, encouraging decision-making in science practices, and connecting science to issues of justice. They varied in both the number of unique justice moves they took up and the specificity with which they planned for incorporating the moves. We discuss implications for practice and theory-building in relation to supporting preservice teachers in learning to teach science toward equity and justice.

AB 5G and future 6G networks support diverse combinations of access technologies, architectures, and radio frequencies, with each combination termed as a "band" henceforth. Through comprehensive measurements in 12 cities across 5 countries, we experimentally show that operator-configured default bands are often highly suboptimal, particularly under mobility. We then propose smart band switching, where a UE's band can be dynamically changed to improve the network performance and boost the application QoE. We discuss challenges, opportunities, and design choices for building a practical smart band switching system. We further develop preliminary UE-side band-switching logic on commodity smartphones, and evaluate it on commercial 5G networks.

ID BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE
AB Introduction Adaptation and learning have been observed to contribute to the acquisition of new motor skills and are used as strategies to cope with changing environments. However, it is hard to determine the relative contribution of each when executing goal directed motor tasks. This study explores the dynamics of neural activity during a center-out reaching task with continuous visual feedback under the influence of rotational perturbations.Methods Results for a brain-computer interface (BCI) task performed by two non-human primate (NHP) subjects are compared to simulations from a reinforcement learning agent performing an analogous task. We characterized baseline activity and compared it to the activity after rotational perturbations of different magnitudes were introduced. We employed principal component analysis (PCA) to analyze the spiking activity driving the cursor in the NHP BCI task as well as the activation of the neural network of the reinforcement learning agent.Results and discussion Our analyses reveal that both for the NHPs and the reinforcement learning agent, the task-relevant neural manifold is isomorphic with the task. However, for the NHPs the manifold is largely preserved for all rotational perturbations explored and adaptation of neural activity occurs within this manifold as rotations are compensated by reassignment of regions of the neural space in an angular pattern that cancels said rotations. In contrast, retraining the reinforcement learning agent to reach the targets after rotation results in substantial modifications of the underlying neural manifold. Our findings demonstrate that NHPs adapt their existing neural dynamic repertoire in a quantitatively precise manner to account for perturbations of different magnitudes and they do so in a way that obviates the need for extensive learning.

AB Wetting plays a crucial role in achieving efficient condensation in applications such as atmospheric water harvesting, air conditioning and refrigeration, and thermal power plants. Despite decades of research, the industrial implementation of dropwise condensation, which is often superior to filmwise condensation, has been limited, mostly due to the poor durability of promoter coatings and the challenge of achieving dropwise condensation for non-aqueous working fluids. Both areas have seen noteworthy advancements over the past few years, some of which we highlight in this review article. For example, recognizing that contact angle hysteresis, not contact angles per se, are responsible for enabling dropwise condensation, ultra-smooth liquid-like polymer coatings and lubricantinfused surfaces were developed for use with water and nonaqueous working fluids. There are also several new developments for passive and active droplet removal. Advances in coating durability include a better understanding in the failure mechanisms and physics-informed designs of new coating processes and chemistries.

AB Using Raman spectroscopy (RS) signals for skin cancer tissue classification has recently drawn significant attention, because of its non-invasive optical technique, which uses molecular structures and conformations within biological tissue for diagnosis. In reality, RS signals are noisy and unstable for training machine learning models. The scarcity of tissue samples also makes it challenging to learn reliable deep-learning networks for clinical usages. In this paper, we advocate a Transfer Contrasting Learning Paradigm (TCLP) to address the scarcity and noisy characteristics of the RS for skin cancer tissue classification. To overcome the challenge of limited samples, TCLP leverages transfer learning to pre-train deep learning models using RS data from similar domains (but collected from different RS equipments for other tasks). To tackle the noisy nature of the RS signals, TCLP uses contrastive learning to augment RS signals to learn reliable feature representation to represent RS signals for final classification. Experiments and comparisons, including statistical tests, demonstrate that TCLP outperforms existing deep learning baselines for RS signal-based skin cancer tissue classification.

ID MODEL; COGNITION; BENEFITS
AB The Affect Heuristic-Cultural Cognition Theory (AH-CCT) model and the Solution Aversion-based (SA) model both suggest affect, meaning feelings or discrete emotions about a target, mediates associations between 'culture,' such as political ideology or cultural biases, and risk responses, such as risk perceptions, protective behaviours, and supportive attitudes towards protective policy. However, the models differ respectively by defining negative affect as directed towards the hazard ('hazard affect') or a specific behaviour or policy response ('solution aversion,' negative affect about a proposed risk reduction method). We compare these models with longitudinal mediation analysis of U.S. COVID-19 survey data (n = 866 in smallest-sample wave). Solution aversion accounted for more associations of culture with risk perceptions, such as personal risk, collective risk, and risk severity; behaviour and behavioural intentions, regarding mask wearing, avoiding large public gatherings, and vaccination; and support for risk mitigation policies, regarding mask mandates, public gathering bans, and vaccination mandates. Statistically significant direct effects were rare and were mainly for egalitarian cultural bias; indirect effects occurred for egalitarians, political conservatives, and individualists. Implications for further research on risk responses are discussed relative to limited previous work on these affect-mediation models.

TI Understanding oblique deposition in aerosol jet printing for conformal
   electronics fabrication
SO JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING PROCESSES

AB Aerosol jet printing is a compelling additive manufacturing technology to enable direct patterning of electronic devices onto complex 3D surfaces. While aerosol jet printing can support deposition in an oblique configuration (with the nozzle misaligned from the surface normal), the altered deposition physics associated with this have not been examined. We address this gap from a fundamental perspective, coupling experiments and numerical simulation to understand the effect of asymmetry in the oblique jet, which sweeps small aerosol droplets downhill on tilted substrates. Modeling results of an oblique aerosol jet show that, although larger droplets are relatively unaffected due to their greater inertia, the altered impaction of smaller droplets results in an asymmetric cross-sectional profile and increased line width, which is sensitive to both the nozzle-surface orientation and offset distance. To complement the numerical simulations, silver traces are printed with varying gas flow rates, nozzle standoff distance, and nozzle orientation. Asymmetry, line width, and resistance increase with tilt angle, an effect reduced at higher flow rates and closer nozzle positioning, corroborating the numerical model. Finally, a printhead mounted on a 6-axis robotic arm was used to conformally print onto a complex 3D surface, showing improved flexibility in process design and highlighting the challenging geometries that can be accommodated when the fundamental mechanisms of oblique aerosol printing are considered.

AB Network anomaly detection systems are vital for identifying malicious activities in computer networks. However, they face a challenge due to class imbalance, where normal traffic outweighs anomalies. This bias leads to models favoring majority classes, neglecting minority anomalies. In this study, we proposed a comprehensive approach to address this issue in network anomaly detection using NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15 datasets. Our method incorporated techniques like random over-sampling (ROS), random under-sampling (RUS), Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), Adaptive Synthetic Sampling (ADASYN), SMOTE combined with Edited Nearest Neighbors (SMOTEENN), and class reduction. We evaluated our approach on these datasets, showing improved performance metrics for bidirectional long-short memory (Bi-LSTM). Our results highlight the importance of addressing class imbalance for robust network anomaly detection, contributing to cybersecurity in modern networks.

ID ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; PREDICTION
AB Wireless networks in agricultural environments are unique in many ways. Recent measurements reveal that the dynamics of crop growth impact wireless propagation channels with a long-term seasonal pattern. Additionally, short-term environmental factors, such as strong wind, result in variations in channel statistics. Next-generation agricultural fields, populated by autonomous tractors, drones, and high-throughput sensing systems, require high-throughput connectivity infrastructure, resulting in the future deployment of high-frequency networks, where they have not been deployed before. More specifically, when millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication systems, a viable candidate for 5G and 6G high-throughput solutions, are deployed for higher throughput, these issues become more prominent due to the relatively small wavelength at this frequency band. To improve coverage in the mmWave spectrum in agricultural settings, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are a promising solution with low energy consumption and high cost efficiency when compared to half-duplex active relays with multiple antennas. To ensure link resiliency under dynamic channel behavior, an adaptive RIS for broadband wireless agricultural networks (AgRIS) at mmWave band is designed in this work. AgRIS relies on output from a time-series model that forecasts the short-term wind speed based on measured wind data, which is readily available in most farms. The temporal correlation between link reliability and wind speed is demonstrated through extensive field experiments. Our simulation results demonstrate that AgRIS with a small footprint of 11 x 11 elements can help mitigate the adversarial effects of wind-induced signal level drop by up to 8 dB and provides high energy efficiency of 1 Gbits/joule.

AB Alkaline reactions of chlorogenic acid (CGA) yield undesirable development of brown or green pigments, limiting the utilization of alkalized CGA-rich foods. Thiols such as cysteine and glutathione mitigate pigment formation through several mechanisms, including redox coupling to reduce CGA quinones, and thiol conjugation, which forms colorless thiolyl-CGA compounds that do not readily participate in color-generating reactions. This work provided evidence of the formation of both aromatic and benzylic thiolyl-CGA conjugate species formed with cysteine and glutathione under alkaline conditions in addition to hydroxylated conjugate species hypothesized to arise from reactions with hydroxyl radicals. Formation of these conjugates proceeds more quickly than CGA dimerization and amine addition reactions mitigating pigment development. Differentiation between aromatic and benzylic conjugates is enabled by characteristic fragmentation of C-S bonds. Acyl migration and hydrolysis of the quinic acid moiety of thiolyl-CGA conjugates yielded a variety of isomeric species also identified through untargeted LC-MS methods.

DE Adult Learners; Prison Education; Computing in Context
AB Higher education is expanding in United States prisons, with a growing demand for STEM offerings. Academics from other disciplines have stressed the importance of culturally relevant pedagogy (CRP) in prison higher education, and computing in context has shown major benefits in CS1- especially for women and nontraditional students. More work is needed to determine what contexts are relevant to incarcerated college students, and how to incorporate these into computing curricula. In this paper, we build on prior work on computing in context and culturally relevant techniques in computing. We analyze course data from a CS1 course taught in a college-in-prison program to answer the following research question: What contexts do incarcerated students in CS1 find relevant? We identify 24 topics pursued by students across 78 open-ended programming assignment submissions, the three most popular being business management, sports statistics, and physical health. These results offer insight into potential contexts that are meaningful to incarcerated college students to be incorporated into future computing curricula and interventions in prisons.

Burrs are a negative byproduct of machining processes that are difficult to avoid because of a limited under-standing of the complex burr formation mechanisms in relation to cutting conditions, including both process parameters and tool condition. Thus, the objective of this work was to characterize burr formation under finish machining conditions via a high-speed, high-resolution in-situ experimental method. Various parameters per-taining to burr geometry such as height, thickness, and initial negative shear angle were measured both during and after cutting. Results showed that varying the conditions of uncut chip thickness, tool-wear, and cutting speed all have a significant effect on burr formation, although certain burr metrics were found to be insensitive with respect to different process conditions because the difference was statistically insignificant. This study provides new insights into the relationships between the workpiece material's microstructure, machining pa-rameters, and tool condition on both crack formation and propagation/plasticity during burr formation. Using digital image correlation (DIC) and a physics-based process model not previously utilized for burr formation analysis, the displacement and corresponding flow stress were calculated at the exit burr root location. This novel semi-analytical approach revealed that the normalized stress at the exit burr root was approximately equal to the flow stress for a variety of different conditions, indicating the potential for model-based prediction of burr formation mechanics. Finally, this study investigates factors that influence fracture evolution during exit burr formation. It was found that negative exit burrs are a direct result of high strain rate and high uncut chip thickness, which was expected, but also a microstructural size effect and a tool-wear effect, neither of which have been previously reported. By harnessing ultra-high-speed imaging and advanced optical microscopy techniques, this manuscript deals with the fundamentals of burr formation, including new insights into material response at the grain-scale to the loads imposed with both sharp and worn tools.

AB The demand for collaborative and private bandit learning across multiple agents is surging due to the growing quantity of data generated from distributed systems. Federated bandit learning has emerged as a promising framework for private, efficient, and decentralized online learning. However, almost all previous works rely on strong assumptions of client homogeneity, i.e., all participating clients shall share the same bandit model; otherwise, they all would suffer linear regret. This greatly restricts the application of federated bandit learning in practice. In this work, we introduce a new approach for federated bandits for heterogeneous clients, which clusters clients for collaborative bandit learning under the federated learning setting. Our proposed algorithm achieves non-trivial sub-linear regret and communication cost for all clients, subject to the communication protocol under federated learning that at anytime only one model can be shared by the server.

AB Recent advancements in object detection and human activity recognition have shown commendable progress, albeit with a predominant focus on adult-centric applications and datasets. This paper proposes a new vision-based, infantfocused hazard detection framework, CribNet, to assess threats to in-crib safety in the form of blanket occlusions and hazardous toys, as a step towards addressing the broad, critical problem of infant sleep safety. CribNet estimates hazards by considering the proximity and characteristics of detected objects around the infants. To evaluate the framework, we created the first publicly available crib hazard detection (CribHD) dataset, consisting of 1,620 images specific to infant-centric environments. These images present a wide range of real-world challenges, including clutter, occlusion, varied lighting conditions, with and without presence of infants in the images. We show that the framework performs with over 80% mean average precision (mAP) in segmenting toys and blankets and accurately assessing hazards, marking a new advancement in infant safety. CribNet and CribHD lay the foundation for future developments in in-crib hazard detection and infant sleep safety1.

SO COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY

ID LANGUAGE; EVOLUTION
AB Predicting novel mutations has long-lasting impacts on life science research. Traditionally, this problem is addressed through wet-lab experiments, which are often expensive and time consuming. The recent advancement in neural language models has provided stunning results in modeling and deciphering sequences. In this paper, we propose a Deep Novel Mutation Search (DNMS) method, using deep neural networks, to model protein sequence for mutation prediction. We use SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as the target and use a protein language model to predict novel mutations. Different from existing research which is often limited to mutating the reference sequence for prediction, we propose a parent-child mutation prediction paradigm where a parent sequence is modeled for mutation prediction. Because mutations introduce changing context to the underlying sequence, DNMS models three aspects of the protein sequences: semantic changes, grammatical changes, and attention changes, each modeling protein sequence aspects from shifting of semantics, grammar coherence, and amino-acid interactions in latent space. A ranking approach is proposed to combine all three aspects to capture mutations demonstrating evolving traits, in accordance with real-world SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequence evolution. DNMS can be adopted for an early warning variant detection system, creating public health awareness of future SARS-CoV-2 mutations.

AB High flexibility, infinite reconfigurability, and fast design-to-market of FPGAs make them a promising platform for modern applications, such as IoT, medical, and automotive applications. Energy and area limitations are challenging in these applications since many of these applications have limited power and hardware resources. Accordingly, the energy- and area-efficient design of FPGAs is of great importance. In this paper, an adiabatic non-volatile hybrid CMOS/MTJ logic-in-memory-based configurable logic block (CLB) has been proposed and compared to its state-of-the-art counterparts. The simulation results show that the proposed design has 98%, 98%, 97%, 97%, 96%, and 92% lower energy consumption compared to CMOS counterparts for frequencies of 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, and 40 MHz. Also, compared to its adiabatic counterparts, the proposed design has at least 74%, 70%, 69%, 69%, and 46% lower energy consumption for frequencies of 1, 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 MHz, respectively. Also, the proposed design has at least 74% fewer transistors compared to its counterparts. Furthermore, the energy saving of the proposed design for different tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) is almost consistent. In addition, the proposed design keeps its superiority in energy saving over its counterparts for different power supply voltages.

AB The growing prevalence of Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) enables a wide range of applications but simultaneously raises numerous security and privacy concerns. A key issue involves the potential privacy exposure of involved parties, such as the customer's input data and the vendor's model. Consequently, two-party computing (2PC) has emerged as a promising solution to safeguard the privacy of different parties during deep neural network (DNN) inference. However, the state-of-the-art (SOTA) 2PC-DNN techniques are tailored explicitly to traditional instruction set architecture (ISA) systems like CPUs and CPU+GPU. This reliance on ISA systems significantly constrains their energy efficiency, as these architectures typically employ 32- or 64-bit instruction sets. In contrast, the possibilities of harnessing dynamic and adaptive quantization to build high-performance 2PC-DNNs remain largely unexplored due to the lack of compatible algorithms and hardware accelerators. To mitigate the bottleneck of SOTA solutions and fill the existing research gaps, this work investigates the construction of 2PC-DNNs on field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). We introduce AQ2PNN, an end-to-end framework that effectively employs adaptive quantization schemes to develop high-performance 2PC-DNNs on FPGAs. From an algorithmic perspective, AQ2PNN introduces an innovative 2PC-ReLU method to replace Yao's Garbled Circuits (GC). Regarding hardware, AQ2PNN employs an extensive set of building blocks for linear operators, non-linear operators, and a specialized Oblivious Transfer (OT) module for secure data exchange, respectively. These algorithm-hardware co-designed modules extremely utilize the fine-grained reconfigurability of FPGAs, to adapt the data bit-width of different DNN layers in the ciphertext domain, thereby reducing communication overhead between parties without compromising DNN performance, such as accuracy. We thoroughly assess AQ2PNN using widely adopted DNN architectures, including ResNet18, ResNet50, and VGG16, all trained on ImageNet and producing quantized models. Experimental results demonstrate that AQ2PNN outperforms SOTA solutions, achieving significantly reduced communication overhead by 25%, improved energy efficiency by 26.3x, and comparable or even superior throughput and accuracy.

AB The PhysioNet open access database (PND) is one of the world's largest and most comprehensive repositories of biosignal data and is widely used by researchers to develop, train, and validate algorithms. To contextualise the results of such algorithms, understanding the underlying demographic distribution of the data is crucial-specifically, the race, ethnicity, sex or gender, and age of study participants. We sought to understand the underlying reporting patterns and characteristics of the demographic data of the datasets available on PND. Of the 181 unique datasets present in the PND as of July 6, 2023, 175 involved human participants, with less than 7% of studies reporting on all four of the key demographic variables. Furthermore, we found a higher rate of reporting sex or gender and age than race and ethnicity. In the studies that did include participant sex or gender, the samples were mostly male. Additionally, we found that most studies were done in North America, particularly in the USA. These imbalances and poor reporting of representation raise concerns regarding potential embedded biases in the algorithms that rely on these datasets. They also underscore the need for universal and comprehensive reporting practices to ensure equitable development and deployment of artificial intelligence and machine learning tools in medicine.

AB Spin transfer torque magnetic random access memory (STT-MRAM) offers a promising solution for low-power and high-density memory due to its compatibility with CMOS, higher density, scalable nature, and non-volatility. However, the higher energy required to write bit cells has remained a key challenge for its adaptation into battery-operated smart handheld devices. The existing low-energy writing solutions require additional complex control logic mechanisms, further constraining the available area. In this research, we propose a solution to design energy-efficient write circuits by incorporating two techniques together. First, we propose the sinusoidal power clocking mechanism replacing the DC power supply in the conventional CMOS design. Second, we propose three lookup table (LUT)-based control logic circuits and one write circuit to reduce the area and further minimize energy dissipation. The experimental results are verified over the case study implementations of 4 x 4 STT-MRAM macro designed using bit cell configurations: i) one transistor and one magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) (1T-1MTJ) and ii) four transistors and two MTJs (4T-2MTJ). The post-layout simulation for the frequency range from 250 kHz to 6.25 MHz shows that the write circuit, which uses the proposed LUT-based control logic circuits and a write driver with a sinusoidal power supply, achieves more than a 65.05% average energy saving compared to the CMOS counterpart. Furthermore, the write circuit, which uses the proposed 6T write driver with the sinusoidal power supply, shows an improvement in energy saving by more than 70.60% compared to the CMOS counterpart. We also verified that the energy-saving performance remains relatively consistent with the change in temperature and the tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) ratio.

AB Activation barriers for elementary electrochemical reactions can show strong dependence on the composition and structure of the electrode-electrolyte interface, the electrochemical double layer (EDL), due to the highly polar nature of ion/electron transfer transition states. A compartmentalized analytical framework, built upon DFT calculations, is developed to consider complex interactions between reaction intermediates and the EDL. The approach analytically captures how altering interfacial properties, such as the dielectric constant or distribution of electrolyte charges, impact electrocatalytic activation barriers. Dipole moment changes along the reaction path plays the largest role in dictating the extent to which interfacial properties impact elementary electrochemical kinetics. The compartmentalization and uncertainty quantification capability of the developed framework is illustrated employing a Helmholtz model with two parameters, dielectric constant and double layer thickness. The framework translates routine DFT analysis of (water -assisted) hydrogenation activation barriers to proton -coupled electron transfer barriers that depend analytically on electrode potential and EDL properties.

AB Detecting unseen instances based on multi-view templates is a challenging problem due to its open-world nature. Traditional methodologies, which primarily rely on 2D representations and matching techniques, are often inadequate in handling pose variations and occlusions. To solve this, we introduce VoxDet, a pioneer 3D geometry-aware framework that fully utilizes the strong 3D voxel representation and reliable voxel matching mechanism. VoxDet first ingeniously proposes template voxel aggregation (TVA) module, effectively transforming multi-view 2D images into 3D voxel features. By leveraging associated camera poses, these features are aggregated into a compact 3D template voxel. In novel instance detection, this voxel representation demonstrates heightened resilience to occlusion and pose variations. We also discover that a 3D reconstruction objective helps to pre-train the 2D-3D mapping in TVA. Second, to quickly align with the template voxel, VoxDet incorporates a Query Voxel Matching (QVM) module. The 2D queries are first converted into their voxel representation with the learned 2D-3D mapping. We find that since the 3D voxel representations encode the geometry, we can first estimate the relative rotation and then compare the aligned voxels, leading to improved accuracy and efficiency. In addition to method, we also introduce the first instance detection benchmark, RoboTools, where 20 unique instances are video-recorded with camera extrinsic. RoboTools also provides 24 challenging cluttered scenarios with more than 9k box annotations. Exhaustive experiments are conducted on the demanding LineMod-Occlusion, YCB-video, and RoboTools benchmarks, where VoxDet outperforms various 2D baselines remarkably with faster speed. To the best of our knowledge, VoxDet is the first to incorporate implicit 3D knowledge for 2D novel instance detection tasks. Our code, data, raw results, and pre-trained models are public at https://github.com/Jaraxxus-Me/VoxDet.

ID EMPATHY
AB Research demonstrates that we continue to be deficient in creating inclusive and equitable software, with a lack of empathy among software developers attributed to this issue, even if unintentional. Although increasing empathy has been shown to be part of the solution, unfortunately there is a lack of data that can be analyzed that shows how empathy-building and accessibility awareness interventions can be utilized in computing education, along with a shortage of free, public, and easily adoptable educational material regarding empathy and the creation of accessible software.
   Through large in-person studies that involve real-world participants, we are able to contribute to the knowledge regarding the potential benefits that can be used to improve computing education by implementing empathy-building strategies in the curriculum. Two forms of accessibility awareness exercises are utilized to display the effectiveness of empathy-based learning and teach the importance of accessibility in computing, including experiential and expression-based interventions. In these interventions, we expect to find an increase in awareness and empathy in participants, as well as an increase in participant interest in the topic of software inclusivity and accessibility by placing the participant in a situation they may encounter in the real world.
   We additionally present a web-hosted, easily adoptable experiential and expression-based educational lab to support the inclusion of inclusive development and/or empathy-focused topics into a variety of curricula formats.

AB Atomic layer deposition (ALD) was applied to develop CeOx-overcoated Ni/Al2O3 catalyst for bi-reforming of methane (BRM), as the combination of dry reforming of methane (DRM) and steam reforming of methane (SRM). Non-stoichiometric CeOx thin films were successfully deposited on Ni/Al2O3 particles by ALD, which constructed a beneficial Ni-CeOx interface and modified the catalyst property. Ascribed to the unique ALD growth mode, a high amount of Ce(III) and oxygen vacancies existed in the ALD-deposited CeOx overcoating. A reduction process before the BRM reaction contributed to the further reduction of Ce(IV) to Ce(III), resulting in more oxygen vacancies. The oxygen vacancies at the Ni-CeOx interface enabled a high rate of CO2 activation and enabled the balance between the activation of CO2 and H2O for BRM. Due to its oxygen vacancies as activation sites for CO2 and H2O, CeOx ALD overcoating significantly improved the activity of Ni/Al2O3 catalyst and achieved a better control in the H2/CO ratio with a suitable ratio of H2O/CO2/CH4 feed. CeOx overcoatings enhanced the reducibility of Ni(II) sites and assisted in preventing Ni from oxidation during the BRM reaction. Less carbon deposition was achieved by the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst with CeOx overcoating as ascribed to its better reactant activation capacity.

The new complexes were characterized by H-1 and F-19 NMR spectroscopies and cyclic voltammetry. The phenoxide ligand on [(PhO)Ni(CF3)(3)](2-) was found to be labile in solution, in contrast to the 7-azaindole ligand on [(7-azaindole)Ni(CF3)(3)](2-). The electrochemical analysis of the heteroleptic complexes revealed that the dianionic species exhibit oxidations below 0 V vs the Fc/Fc(+) couple.

AB Vehicular Edge computing requires computational power from connected Edge devices in the network to process incoming vehicle work requests. This connection and offloading allows for faster and more efficient data processing and thus improves the safety, performance, and reliability of the connected vehicles. Existing works focus on the processor and its characterization, but they forgo the connecting components. Memory resource and storage resource is limited on Edge devices, and the two combined incur a heavy impact on deep learning. This is prominent as perception-based workloads have yet to be studied deeply. In our characterization, we have found that memory contention can be split into 3 behaviors. Each of these behaviors interacts with the other resources differently. Then, in our deep neural network (DNN) layer analysis, we find several layers that see computation time increases of over 2849% for convolutional layers and 1173.34% for activation layers. Through the characterization, we can model the workload behavior for the Edge based on the device configuration and the workload requirements. Through this, the impacts of memory contention and its impacts are quantified. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such work that characterizes the memory impacts towards vehicular edge computational workloads with a deep focus on memory and DNN layers.

AB Data-driven approaches to materials exploration and discovery are building momentum due to emerging advances in machine learning. However, parsimonious representations of crystals for navigating the vast materials search space remain limited. To address this limitation, we introduce a materials discovery framework that utilizes natural language embeddings from language models as representations of compositional and structural features. The contextual knowledge encoded in these language representations conveys information about material properties and structures, enabling both similarity analysis to recall relevant candidates based on a query material and multi-task learning to share information across related properties. Applying this framework to thermoelectrics, we demonstrate diversified recommendations of prototype crystal structures and identify under-studied material spaces. Validation through first-principles calculations and experiments confirms the potential of the recommended materials as high-performance thermoelectrics. Language-based frameworks offer versatile and adaptable embedding structures for effective materials exploration and discovery, applicable across diverse material systems.

ID SOCIAL SUSTAINABILITY; BEHAVIOR; VALUES
AB In a world faced with ever-growing crises of climate change, economic inequality, and social injustice, sustainability has become a catch-all term to address these challenges and more. However, efforts to measure the social, environmental, and economic factors of sustainability are undermined by inconsistent understandings of the term. This research seeks to address this gap in sustainability research by constructing a wide-reaching propensity instrument that incorporates the different constructs of sustainability. A literature review informed propensity instrument construction. The first version of the instrument included 269 items, which were narrowed to 100 after an iterative process of merging, refinement, and elimination. The 100 scale items were deployed through an online survey, where 162 responses were collected to inform data analysis. Principal component analysis revealed two primary factors of Sustainable Behavior and Sustainability Attitude. After further refinement based on items' factor-loading scores and communalities, 13 items remained that described sustainability as environmentally and socially conscious behaviors and attitudes. The third construct of sustainability, economics, was not present after such refinements, suggesting that purely economic behaviors and attitudes are disparate from individuals' sustainability propensity. This new propensity instrument informs the understanding of sustainability and provides a tool for measuring sustainability with more breadth.

AB Knowledge of the thermospheric density is essential for calculating the drag in low Earth orbit satellites. Existing models struggle to predict density accurately. In this paper, we propose thermospheric density prediction using a deep evidential model-based framework that incorporates empirical models, accelerometer-inferred density from the CHAMP satellite, and geomagnetic and solar indices. The framework is investigated on both quiet and storm conditions. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model can predict the thermospheric density with high accuracy and reliable uncertainty in both quiet and storm times. The predicted results from the evidential model are advantageous over the Gaussian Processes (GPs) model in our previous studies. Furthermore, the proposed model can also provide insightful aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties.

ID MASS INCARCERATION
AB The US incarcerates more people, and at a higher rate, than any other country in the world-predominantly low-income people of color. Higher education in prison (HEP) has a powerful impact on justice-impacted people, improving their quality of life during incarceration and reducing their likelihood of returning to prison post-release. HEP nearly disappeared in 1994 after Pell Grant eligibility was eliminated for incarcerated students, which was recently reinstated. More computing educators can reach incarcerated students with digital literacy skills, core computing content, and critical analyses of the impacts of computing on society. CS education researchers can also support the growth of CS education in prisons, and influence policies restricting technology infrastructure.

AB Image-driven social sensing (ISS) is emerging as a pervasive sensing paradigm that collects the status of the physical world by leveraging image data from human sensors. This paper studies a dynamic hyperparameter optimization problem in ISS applications and our objective is to dynamically determine the optimal hyperparameter configuration of an AI-based ISS solution that provides the accurate label for each image in the data stream of ISS applications. Our work is motivated by the observation that current ISS solutions leverage a static hyperparameter configuration that is often configured manually by AI experts, which fails to capture the potential large dynamics of ISS applications. To address this limitation, we develop DC-HPO, a dynamic crowd-assisted hyperparameter optimization system that utilizes crowdsourced human intelligence to dynamically steer the search of the optimal hyperparameter configuration for each image in the data stream of ISS applications. The experimental results on two ISS applications from real world (i.e., intelligent urban infrastructure monitoring and city environment cleanliness assessment) demonstrate that DC-HPO outperforms existing deep convolutional neural networks, crowd-AI models, and hyperparameter optimization methods in achieving the best ISS performance while keeping the lowest computational cost.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Visualizations have played a crucial role in helping quantum computing users explore quantum states in various quantum computing applications. Among them, Bloch Sphere is the widely-used visualization for showing quantum states, which leverages angles to represent quantum amplitudes. However, it cannot support the visualization of quantum entanglement and superposition, the two essential properties of quantum computing. To address this issue, we propose VENUS, a novel visualization for quantum state representation. By explicitly correlating 2D geometric shapes based on the math foundation of quantum computing characteristics, VENUS effectively represents quantum amplitudes of both the single qubit and two qubits for quantum entanglement. Also, we use multiple coordinated semicircles to naturally encode probability distribution, making the quantum superposition intuitive to analyze. We conducted two well-designed case studies and an in-depth expert interview to evaluate the usefulness and effectiveness of VENUS. The result shows that VENUS can effectively facilitate the exploration of quantum states for the single qubit and two qubits.

AB Vehicular edge computing relies on the computational capabilities of interconnected edge devices to manage incoming requests from vehicles. This offloading process enhances the speed and efficiency of data handling, ultimately boosting the safety, performance, and reliability of connected vehicles. While previous studies have concentrated on processor characteristics, they often overlook the significance of the connecting components. Limited memory and storage resources on edge devices pose challenges, particularly in the context of deep learning, where these limitations can significantly affect performance. The impact of memory contention has not been thoroughly explored, especially regarding perception-based tasks. In our analysis, we identified three distinct behaviors of memory contention, each interacting differently with other resources. Additionally, our investigation of Deep Neural Network (DNN) layers revealed that certain convolutional layers experienced computation time increases exceeding 2849%, while activation layers showed a rise of 1173.34%. Through our characterization efforts, we can model workload behavior on edge devices according to their configuration and the demands of the tasks. This allows us to quantify the effects of memory contention. To our knowledge, this study is the first to characterize the influence of memory on vehicular edge computational workloads, with a strong emphasis on memory dynamics and DNN layers.

AB Multicomponent metallic glasses (MGs) are a fascinating class of advanced alloys known for their exceptional properties such as limit-approaching strength, high hardness and corrosion resistance, and near-net-shape castability. One important question regarding these materials that remains unanswered is how the different elements and atomic bonds within them control their strength and deformability. Here, we present a detailed visual and statistical analysis of the behaviors of various elements and atomic bonds in the Zr47Cu46Al7 (at%) MG during a uniaxial tensile test (in the z-direction) simulated using molecular dynamics. Specifically, we investigate the identities of atoms undergoing significant shear strain, and the averaged bond lengths, projected z-lengths, and z-angles (angles with respect to the z-direction) of all the atomic bonds as functions of increasing strain. We show that, prior to yielding, the Zr element and the intermediate (Zr-Zr, Cu-Al) and stronger (Zr-Al, Zr-Cu) bonds dominate the elastic deformation and strength, while the Cu and Al elements and the weaker Al-Al and Cu-Cu bonds contribute more to the highly localized shear transformation. The significant reconstruction, as signified by the cessation of bond-length increment and bond-angle decrement, of the intermediate and the stronger bonds triggers yielding of the material. After yielding, all the elements and bonds participate in the plastic deformation while the stronger bonds contribute more to the residual strength and the ultimate (fracture) strain. The results provide new insights into the atomic mechanisms underlying the mechanical behavior of multicomponent MGs, and may assist in the future design of MG compositions towards better combination of strength and deformability.

AB Motion planning of autonomous agents in partially known environments with incomplete information is a challenging problem, particularly for complex tasks. This paper proposes a model-free reinforcement learning approach to address this problem. We formulate motion planning as a probabilistic-labeled partially observable Markov decision process (PL-POMDP) problem and use linear temporal logic (LTL) to express the complex task. The LTL formula is then converted to a limit-deterministic generalized Buchi automaton (LDGBA). The problem is redefined as finding an optimal policy on the product of PL-POMDP with LDGBA based on model-checking techniques to satisfy the complex task. We implement deep Q learning with long short-term memory (LSTM) to process the observation history and task recognition. Our contributions include the proposed method, the utilization of LTL and LDGBA, and the LSTM-enhanced deep Q learning. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method by conducting simulations in various environments, including grid worlds, a virtual office, and a multi-agent warehouse. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method effectively addresses environment, action, and observation uncertainties. This indicates its potential for real-world applications, including the control of unmanned aerial vehicles.

AB Smart cameras have been increasingly deployed in smart homes for remote monitoring and enhancing home security. However, extensive recent research has uncovered potential user privacy threats associated with popular commercial camera systems. Some manufacture design of these commercial camera systems usually requires smart camera users to relinquish their control of camera recorded data. For instance, these cameras often upload camera recordings to their cloud servers to enable advanced data analysis for camera app services. To facilitate enhanced camera services, the data may be further shared with on-path vendors, third parties of manufacturers, and cloud providers, potentially allowing them to access video footage or image captures without users' awareness or meaningful consent.
   To address this problem, we design a new smart camera system-PACAS that enables people to regain the control of their data while still retaining access to regular camera services. We evaluate PACAS using multiple camera video footage traces and on multiple real-world camera prototypes. We show that PACAS can achieve the performance of 0.5 second living streaming latency at a frame rate of 30 fps and a resolution of 240x320 on average. PACAS offers compelling evidence that smart camera systems can deliver on-device modern capabilities comparable to those provided by current commercial systems, all while upholding user privacy.

AB Deep neural network (DNN) models have become prevalent in edge devices for real-time inference. However, they are vulnerable to model extraction attacks and require protection. Existing defense approaches either fail to fully safeguard model confidentiality or result in significant latency issues. To overcome these challenges, this paper presents MirrorNet, which leverages Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to enable secure on-device DNN inference. It generates a TEE-friendly implementation for any given DNN model to protect the model confidentiality, while meeting the stringent computation and storage constraints of TEE. The framework consists of two key components: the backbone model (BackboneNet), which is stored in the normal world but achieves lower inference accuracy, and the Companion Partial Monitor (CPM), a lightweight mirrored branch stored in the secure world, preserving model confidentiality. During inference, the CPM monitors the intermediate results from the BackboneNet and rectifies the classification output to achieve higher accuracy. To enhance flexibility, MirrorNet incorporates two modules: the CPM Strategy Generator, which generates various protection strategies, and the Performance Emulator, which estimates the performance of each strategy and selects the most optimal one. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of MirrorNet in providing security guarantees while maintaining low computation latency, making MirrorNet a practical and promising solution for secure on-device DNN inference. For the evaluation, MirrorNet can achieve a 18.6% accuracy gap between authenticated and illegal use, while only introducing 0.99% hardware overhead.

   PSEUDOPOTENTIALS; DESIGN
AB Improving our fundamental understanding of complex heterocatalytic processes increasingly relies on electronic structure simulations and microkinetic models based on calculated energy differences. In particular, calculation of activation barriers, usually achieved through compute-intensive saddle point search routines, remains a serious bottleneck in understanding trends in catalytic activity for highly branched reaction networks. Although the well-known Bronsted-Evans-Polyani (BEP) scaling - a one-feature linear regression model - has been widely applied in such microkinetic models, they still rely on calculated reaction energies and may not generalize beyond a single facet on a single class of materials, e. g., a terrace sites on transition metals. For highly branched and energetically shallow reaction networks, such as electrochemical CO2 reduction or wastewater remediation, calculating even reaction energies on many surfaces can become computationally intractable due to the combinatorial explosion of states that must be considered. Here, we investigate the feasibility of activation barrier prediction without knowledge of the reaction energy using linear and nonlinear machine learning (ML) models trained on a new database of over 500 dehydrogenation activation barriers. We also find that inclusion of the reaction energy significantly improves both classes of ML models, but complex nonlinear models can achieve performance similar to the simplest BEP scaling when predicting activation barriers on new systems. Additionally, inclusion of the reaction energy significantly improves generalizability to new systems beyond the training set. Our results suggest that the reaction energy is a critical feature to consider when building models to predict activation barriers, indicating that efforts to reliably predict reaction energies through, e. g., the Open Catalyst Project and others, will be an important route to effective model development for more complex systems.
   The table of contents graphic contains a violin plot of both a one-feature linear regression model with the reaction energy as a feature (i. e., the Bronsted-Evans-Polanyi model) and a complex random forest DFT-free model. Both models have similar mean absolute error, suggesting the possibility of predicting activation barriers with no DFT input. image

TI Reevaluation of the 22 Ne(<i> p</i> , γ ) 23 Na reaction rate
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW C

DT Article
ID NUCLEAR-STRUCTURE; NE-22
AB The 22Ne(p, gamma ) 23Na capture reaction is a key step in the Ne-Na cycle of hydrogen burning. The rate of this reaction is critical in classical novae nucleosynthesis and hot bottom burning (HBB) processes in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. Despite its astrophysical importance, significant uncertainty remains in the reaction rate due to several narrow low-energy resonances lying within and near the Gamow window. The present work revisits this reaction by examining the contribution of the 8664 keV subthreshold state and the 8945 keV doublet resonance state of 7/2- configuration in 23Na. Finite range distorted-wave Born approximation (FRDWBA) analysis of existing 22Ne(3He, d) 23Na transfer reaction data was carried out to extract the peripheral asymptotic normalization coefficients (ANCs) of the 8664 keV state. The ANC value obtained in the present work is approximate to 25% higher compared to the previous work by Santra et al. [Phys. Rev. C 101, 025802 (2020)]. Systematic R-matrix calculations were performed to obtain the nonresonant astrophysical S factor utilizing the enhanced ANC value. The resonance strengths of the 8945 keV doublets were deduced from shell model calculations. The rate calculations are performed by omitting the resonances at Ex = 8862, 8894, and 9000 keV, which are unlikely to exist as reported by Carrasco-Rojas et al. [Phys. Rev. C 108, 045802 (2023)]. The total reaction rate is found to be approximate to 15-20% higher at temperatures relevant for the HBB processes, compared to the recent rate measured by Williams et al. [Phys. Rev. C 102, 035801 (2020)], and matches their rate at temperatures of interest for classical novae nucleosynthesis.

AB Geomagnetic activities have a crucial impact on Earth, which can affect spacecraft and electrical power grids. Geospace scientists use a geomagnetic index, called the Kp index, to describe the overall level of geomagnetic activity. This index is an important indicator of disturbances in the Earth's magnetic field and is used by the U.S. Space Weather Prediction Center as an alert and warning service for users who may be affected by the disturbances. Another commonly used index, called the ap index, is converted from the Kp index. Early and accurate prediction of the Kp and ap indices is essential for preparedness and disaster risk management. In this paper, we present a deep learning framework, named GNet, to perform short-term forecasting of the Kp and ap indices. Specifically, GNet takes as input time series of solar wind parameters' values, provided by NASA's Space Science Data Coordinated Archive, and predicts as output the Kp and ap indices respectively at time point t + w hours for a given time point t where w ranges from ranges from 1 to 9. GNet combines transformer encoder blocks with Bayesian inference, which is capable of quantifying both aleatoric uncertainty (data uncertainty) and epistemic uncertainty (model uncertainty) in making predictions. Experimental results show that GNet outperforms closely related machine learning methods in terms of the root mean square error and R-squared score. Furthermore, GNet can provide both data and model uncertainty quantification results, which the existing methods cannot offer. To our knowledge, this is the first time that Bayesian transformers have been used for geomagnetic activity prediction.

AB The construction industry has long been plagued by low productivity and high injury and fatality rates. Robots have been envisioned to automate the construction process, thereby substantially improving construction productivity and safety. Despite the enormous potential, teaching robots to perform complex construction tasks is challenging. We present a generalizable framework to harness human teleoperation data to train construction robots to perform repetitive construction tasks. First, we develop a teleoperation method and interface to control robots on construction sites, serving as an intermediate solution toward full automation. Teleoperation data from human operators, along with context information from the job site, can be collected for robot learning. Second, we propose a new method for extracting keyframes from human operation data to reduce noise and redundancy in the training data, thereby improving robot learning efficacy. We propose a hierarchical imitation learning method that incorporates the keyframes to train the robot to generate appropriate trajectories for construction tasks. Third, we model the robot's visual observations of the working space in a compact latent space to improve learning performance and reduce computational load. To validate the proposed framework, we conduct experiments teaching a robot to generate appropriate trajectories for excavation tasks from human operators' teleoperations. The results suggest that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating its significant potential for application.

AB Public schools are currently a source of major political conflict, specifically with regard to topics related to LGBT representation in the curriculum. We report on a large nationally representative survey of American households focusing on their views on what LGBT topics are and should be taught, and what LGBT-themed books should be assigned and available. We report results overall and broken down by demographic, partisan, and geographic variables. We find that Americans report that they largely do not know what topics are being taught in schools, but they do not think LGBT topics are being taught to elementary children. There is widespread opposition to teaching about LGBT topics in elementary school, with more mixed support in high school. Voters are much more opposed to LGBT-themed books being assigned to students than simply made available to them (e.g. in libraries). There are very large splits in attitudes toward LGBT topics in schools, especially along political and religious lines and across states and counties based on partisan lean. We discuss implications of these findings for education policy and urge greater understanding of Americans' views about 'controversial' topics in the curriculum.

AB Large language models (LLMs) are gaining attention due to their potential to enhance efficiency and sustainability in the building domain, a critical area for reducing global carbon emissions. Built on transformer architectures, LLMs excel at text generation and data analysis, enabling applications such as automated energy model generation, energy management optimization, and fault detection and diagnosis. These models can potentially streamline complex workflows, enhance decision-making, and improve energy efficiency. However, integrating LLMs into building energy systems poses challenges, including high computational demands, data preparation costs, and the need for domain-specific customization. This perspective paper explores the role of LLMs in the building energy system sector, highlighting their potential applications and limitations. We propose a development roadmap built on in-context learning, domain-specific fine-tuning, retrieval augmented generation, and multimodal integration to enhance LLMs' customization and practical use in this field. This paper aims to spark ideas for bridging the gap between LLMs capabilities and practical building applications, offering insights into the future of LLM-driven methods in building energy applications.

DT Editorial Material
AB Increasingly intense and frequent ocean heatwaves are causing widespread coral mortality. These heatwaves are just one of the many stressors - among for instance ocean acidification, nutrient pollution and destructive fi shing practices - that have caused widespread decline of coral reefs over the past century. This destruction of reefs threatens the remarkable biodiversity of organisms that depend upon coral reefs. However, recent research suggests that many of the fishes and invertebrates that inhabit coral reefs may play an underappreciated role in infl uencing the resistance and recovery of corals to stressors, especially those caused by global climate change such as ocean heatwaves. Unraveling the threads that link these coral inhabitants to the corals' response to stressors has the potential to weave a more comprehensive model of resilience that integrates the plight of coral reefs with the breathtaking diversity of life they host. Here, we aim to elucidate the critical roles that coral-associated fishes and invertebrates play in mediating coral resilience to environmental stressors. By integrating recent research fi ndings, we aim to showcase how these often-overlooked organisms infl uence coral resilience in the face of climate change.

AB Artificial Intelligence (AI) ethics establishes a moral framework to guide responsible AI technology use. This paper introduces a model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach to address ethical constraints in motion planning problems, particularly in complex tasks within partially observable environments. Leveraging the Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) for motion planning in environments with incomplete knowledge and Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) for task formulation, ethical norms are categorized as 'hard' and 'soft' constraints. Our approach involves generating a product of POMDP and LTL-induced automaton. An optimal policy is then learned, ensuring task completion while adhering to ethical constraints through model checking. To handle the situations where the agent lacks task awareness, we propose a novel modification to deep Q-learning. This model-free deep RL method employs a neural network architecture with environmental observations and recognized labels as inputs. An illustrative example showcases the applicability of our approach to motion planning problems. The flexibility and generality of this method make it suitable for addressing various ethical decision-making problems.

AB The phase transition from subcritical to supercritical conditions, referred to as transcritical behavior, significantly impacts the evaporation and fuel-air mixing in high-pressure liquid-fuel propulsion systems. Transcritical behavior is characterized as a transition from classical two-phase evaporation to a single-phase gas-like diffusion regime as surface tension and latent heat of vaporization reduce. However, the interfacial behavior represented by the surface tension coefficient and evaporation rate during this transition which are crucial inputs for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of practical transcritical fuel spray is still missing. This study aims at developing new evaporation rate and surface tension models for transcritical n-dodecane droplets using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations irrespective of the droplet size. As MD simulations are primarily limited to the nanoscale, the new models can bridge the gap between MD and continuum simulations and enable the direct application of these findings to microscopic droplets. A new characteristic timescale, i.e., "undroplet time," is defined which marks the transition from classical two-phase evaporation to single-phase gas-like diffusion behavior. The undroplet time indicates the onset of droplet core disintegration and penetration of nitrogen molecules into the droplet, which occurs after the vanishment of the surface tension. By normalizing the time with respect to the undroplet time, the rate of surface tension decay, evaporation rate, and the rate of droplet mass depletion become independent of the droplet size. Calculation of pairwise correlation coefficients for the entire MD results shows that both surface tension coefficient and evaporation rate are strongly correlated with the background temperature, while pressure and droplet size play a less significant role past the critical point. Therefore, new models for surface tension coefficient and evaporation rate spanning from sub-to supercritical conditions are developed as a function of background pressure and temperature, which can be used in continuum simulations. The identified phase change behavior based on the undroplet time shows a good agreement with the phase change regime maps obtained using microscale experiments and nanoscale MD predictions.

AB Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many children receive language input through face coverings. The impact of face coverings for children's abilities to understand language remains unclear. Past research with monolingual children suggests that hearing words through surgical masks does not disrupt word recognition, but hearing words through transparent face shields proves more challenging. In this study, we investigated effects of different face coverings (surgical masks and transparent face shields) on language comprehension in bilingual children. Three-year-old English-Mandarin bilingual children (N = 28) heard familiar words in both English and Mandarin spoken through transparent face shields, surgical masks, and without masks. When tested in English, children recognized words presented without a mask and through a surgical mask, but did not recognize words presented with transparent face shields, replicating past findings with monolingual children. In contrast, when tested in Mandarin, children recognized words presented without a mask, through a surgical mask, and through a transparent face shield. Results are discussed in terms of specific properties of English and Mandarin that may elicit different effects for transparent face shields. Overall, the present findings suggest that face coverings, and in particular, surgical masks do not disrupt spoken word recognition in young bilingual children.

AB Inequitable software is a common problem. Bias may be caused by developers, or even software users. As a society, it is crucial that we understand and identify the causes and implications of software bias from both users and the software itself. To address the problems of inequitable software, it is essential that we inform and motivate the next generation of software developers regarding bias and its adverse impacts. However, research shows that there is a lack of easily adoptable ethics-focused educational material to support this effort.
   To address the problem of inequitable software, we created an easily adoptable, self-contained experiential activity that is designed to foster student interest in software ethics, with a specific emphasis on AI/ML bias. This activity involves participants selecting fictitious teammates based solely on their appearance. The participant then experiences bias either against themselves or a teammate by the activity's fictitious AI. The created lab was then utilized in this study involving 173 real-world users (age 18-51+) to better understand user bias.
   The primary findings of our study include: I) Participants from minority ethnic groups have stronger feeling regarding being impacted by inequitable software/AI, II) Participants with higher interest in AI/ML have a higher belief for the priority of unbiased software, III) Users do not act in an equitable manner, as avatars with 'dark' skin color are less likely to be selected, and IV) Participants from different demographic groups exhibit similar behavior bias. The created experiential lab activity may be executed using only a browser and internet connection, and is publicly available on our project website: https://all.rit.edu.

AB Curvature-generating proteins that direct membrane trafficking assemble on the surface of lipid bilayers to bud transport intermediates, which move protein and lipid cargoes from one cellular compartment to another. However, it remains unclear what controls the overall shape of the membrane bud once curvature induction has begun. In vitro experiments showed that excessive concentrations of the COPII protein Sar1 promoted the formation of membrane tubules from synthetic vesicles, while COPII-coated transport intermediates in cells are generally more spherical or lobed in shape. To understand the origin of these morphological differences, we employ atomistic, coarse-grained (CG), and continuum mesoscopic simulations of membranes in the presence of multiple curvature-generating proteins. We first characterize the membrane-bending ability of amphipathic peptides derived from the amino terminus of Sar1, as a function of interpeptide angle and concentration using an atomistic bicelle simulation protocol. Then, we employ CG simulations to reveal that Sec23 and Sec24 control the relative spacing between Sar1 protomers and form the inner-coat unit through an attachment with Sar1. Finally, using dynamical triangulated surface simulations based on the Helfrich Hamiltonian, we demonstrate that the uniform distribution of spacer molecules among curvature-generating proteins is crucial to the spherical budding of the membrane. Overall, our analyses suggest a new role for Sec23, Sec24, and cargo proteins in COPII-mediated membrane budding process in which they act as spacers to preserve a dispersed arrangement of Sar1 protomers and help determine the overall shape of the membrane bud.

AB RCB stars are L approximate to 10(4) L-circle dot solar-mass objects that can exhibit large periods of extinction from dust ejection episodes. Many exhibit semi-regular pulsations in the range of 30-50 days with semi-amplitudes of 0.05-0.3 mag. Space-based photometry has discovered that solar-like oscillations are ubiquitous in hydrogen-dominated stars that have substantial outer convective envelopes, so we explore the hypothesis that the pulsations in RCB stars and the closely related dustless hydrogen-deficient carbon (dLHdC) stars, which have large convective outer envelopes of nearly pure helium, have a similar origin. Through stellar modeling and pulsation calculations, we find that the observed periods and amplitudes of these pulsations follows the well-measured phenomenology of their H-rich brethren. In particular, we show that the observed modes are likely of angular orders l = 0, 1, and 2 and predominantly of an acoustic nature (i.e., p-modes with low radial order). The modes with largest amplitude are near the acoustic cutoff frequency appropriately rescaled to the helium-dominated envelope, and the observed amplitudes are consistent with that seen in high-luminosity (L > 10(3) L-circle dot) H-rich giants. We also find that for T-eff greater than or similar to 5400 K, an hydrogen-deficient carbon stellar model exhibits a radiative layer between two outer convective zones, creating a g-mode cavity that supports much longer period (approximate to 100 days) oscillations. Our initial work was focused primarily on the adiabatic modes, but we expect that subsequent space-based observations of these targets (e.g., with TESS or Plato) are likely to lead to a larger set of detected frequencies that would allow for a deeper study of the interiors of these rare stars.

AB FPGA virtualization has garnered significant industry and academic interests as it aims to enable multi-tenant cloud systems that can accommodate multiple users' circuits on a single FPGA. Although this approach greatly enhances the efficiency of hardware resource utilization, it also introduces new security concerns. As a representative study, one state-of-the-art (SOTA) adversarial fault injection attack, named Deep-Dup [1], exemplifies the vulnerabilities of off-chip data communication within the multi-tenant cloud-FPGA system. Deep-Dup attacks successfully demonstrate the complete failure of a wide range of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in a black-box setup, by only injecting fault to extremely small amounts of sensitive weight data transmissions, which are identified through a powerful differential evolution searching algorithm. Such emerging adversarial fault injection attack reveals the urgency of effective defense methodology to protect DNN applications on the multi-tenant cloud-FPGA system.
   This paper, for the first time, presents a novel moving-target-defense (MTD) oriented defense framework DeepShuffle, which could effectively protect DNNs on multi-tenant cloud-FPGA against the SOTA Deep-Dup attack, through a novel lightweight model parameter shuffling methodology. DeepShuffle effectively counters the Deep-Dup attack by altering the weight transmission sequence, which effectively prevents adversaries from identifying security-critical model parameters from the repeatability of weight transmission during each inference round. Importantly, DeepShuffle represents a training-free DNN defense methodology, which makes constructive use of the typologies of DNN architectures to achieve being lightweight. Moreover, the deployment of DeepShuffle neither requires any hardware modification nor suffers from any performance degradation. We evaluate DeepShuffle on the SOTA opensource FPGA-DNN accelerator, Vertical Tensor Accelerator (VTA), which represents the practice of real-world FPGA-DNN system developers. We then evaluate the performance overhead of DeepShuffle and find it only consumes an additional similar to 3% of the inference time compared to the unprotected baseline. DeepShuffle improves the robustness of various SOTA DNN architectures like VGG, ResNet, etc. against Deep-Dup by orders. It effectively reduces the efficacy of evolution searching-based adversarial fault injection attack close to random fault injection attack, e.g., on VGG-11, even after increasing the attacker's effort by 2.3x, our defense shows a similar to 93% improvement in accuracy, compared to the unprotected baseline.

AB Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) experiments, including ion mobility spectrometry mass spectrometry (ESI-IMS-MS) and electron capture dissociation (ECD) of proteins ionized from aqueous solutions, have been used for the study of solution-like structures of intact proteins. By mixing aqueous proteins with denaturants online before ESI, the amount of protein unfolding can be precisely controlled and rapidly analyzed, permitting the characterization of protein folding intermediates in protein folding pathways. Herein, we mixed various pH solutions online with aqueous cytochrome C for unfolding and characterizing its unfolding intermediates with ESI-MS charge state distribution measurements, IMS, and ECD. The presence of folding intermediates and unfolded cytochrome c structures were detected from changes in charge states, arrival time distributions (ATDs), and ECD. We also compared structures from nondenaturing and denaturing solution mixtures measured under "gentle " (i.e., low energy) ion transmission conditions with structures measured under "harsh " (i.e., higher energy) transmission. This work confirms that when using "gentle " instrument conditions, the gas-phase cytochrome c ions reflect attributes of the various solution-phase structures. However, "harsh " conditions that maximize ion transmission produce extended structures that no longer correlate with changes in solution structure.

AB RowHammer attacks have become a serious security problem on deep neural networks (DNNs). Some carefully induced bit-flips degrade the prediction accuracy of DNN models to random guesses. This work proposes a lightweight defense framework that detects and mitigates adversarial bit-flip attacks. We employ a dynamic channel-shuffling obfuscation scheme to present moving targets to the attack, and develop a logits-based model integrity monitor with negligible performance loss. The parameters and architecture of DNN models remain unchanged, which ensures lightweight deployment and makes the framework compatible with commodity models. We demonstrate that our framework can protect various DNN models against RowHammer attacks.

AB The variance of noise plays an important role in many change-point detection procedures and the associated inferences. Most commonly used variance estimators require strong assumptions on the true mean structure or normality of the error distribution, which may not hold in applications. More importantly, the qualities of these estimators have not been discussed systematically in the literature. In this paper, we introduce a framework of equivariant variance estimation for multiple change-point models. In particular, we characterize the set of all equivariant unbiased quadratic variance estimators for a family of change-point model classes, and develop a minimax theory for such estimators.

AB We propose easy-to-implement heuristics for time-constrained applications of a problem referred to in the literature as the facility location problem with immobile servers, stochastic demand, and congestion, the service system design problem, or the immobile server problem (ISP). The problem is typically posed as one of allocating capacity to a set of M/M/1 queues to which customers with stochastic demand are assigned with the objective of minimizing a cost function composed of a fixed capacity-acquisition cost, a variable customer-assignment cost, and an expected-waiting-time cost. The expected-waiting-time cost results in a nonlinear term in the objective function of the standard binary programming formulation of the problem. Thus, the solution approaches proposed in the literature are either sophisticated linearization or relaxation schemes, or metaheuristics. In this study, we demonstrate that an ensemble of straightforward, greedy heuristics can rapidly find high-quality solutions. In addition to filling a gap in the literature on ISP heuristics, new stopping criteria for an existing cutting plane algorithm are proposed and tested, and a new mixed-integer linear model requiring no iterating algorithm is developed. In many cases, our heuristic approach finds solutions of the same or better quality than those found by exact methods implemented with expensive, state-of-the-art mathematical programming software, in particular a commercial nonlinear mixed-integer linear programming solver, given a five-minute time limit.

DE Cecropia; germination trials; Ochroma; pioneer trees; seed dormancy;

AB Seed dormancy in plants can have a significant impact on their ecology. Recent work by Rojas-Villa and Quijano-Abril (2023) classified the seed dormancy class in 14 plant species from the Andean forests of Colombia by using germination trials and several microscopy techniques to describe seed anatomy and morphology. The authors conclude that Cecropia species have both physical and physiological dormancy (of which they call physiophysical dormancy) based on seed morphology and mean germination times of over 30 days. Here, we present seed permeability and germination data from neotropical pioneer tree species: Ochroma pyramidale, Cecropia longipes, and Cecropia insignis, as well as Cecropia peltata (present in Rojas-Villa and Quijano-Abril, 2023), to demonstrate that Cecropia species do not exhibit dormancy and also have high levels of seed permeability. We find that the mean germination time for all three Cecropia species in our study was less than 30 days. This suggests a need for reporting the conditions in which germination trials take place to allow for comparability among studies and using seed permeability tests to accurately identify the physical dormancy class of seeds. Further, we present data from the literature that suggests that dormancy is not a requirement for seed persistence in the seed bank.

AB Graph representation learning is a fundamental technique for machine learning (ML) success in link prediction. On closer investigation, we observe that the performance is measured by the AUC (area under the curve), which suffers biases. Since the ground truth in link prediction is sparse, we design a vertex-centric measure of performance, called the VCMPR@k plots. Under this measure, we show that link predictors using graph representations show poor scores. Despite having extremely high AUC scores, the predictors miss much of the ground truth. We identify a mathematical connection between this performance, the sparsity of the ground truth, and the low-dimensional geometry of the node embeddings. Under a formal theoretical framework, we prove that low-dimensional vectors cannot capture sparse ground truth using dot product similarities (the standard practice in the literature). Our results call into question existing results on link prediction and pose a significant scientific challenge for graph representation learning. The VCMPR plots identify specific scientific challenges for link prediction using low-dimensional node embeddings.

AB Differentially private (DP) mechanisms have been deployed in a variety of high-impact social settings (perhaps most notably by the U.S. Census). Since all DP mechanisms involve adding noise to results of statistical queries, they are expected to impact our ability to accurately analyze and learn from data, in effect trading off privacy with utility. Alarmingly, the impact of DP on utility can vary significantly among different sub-populations. A simple way to reduce this disparity is with stratification. First compute an independent private estimate for each group in the data set (which may be the intersection of several protected classes), then, to compute estimates of global statistics, appropriately recombine these group estimates. Our main observation is that naive stratification often yields high-accuracy estimates of population-level statistics, without the need for additional privacy budget. We support this observation theoretically and empirically. Our theoretical results center on the private mean estimation problem, while our empirical results center on extensive experiments on private data synthesis to demonstrate the effectiveness of stratification on a variety of private mechanisms. Overall, we argue that this straightforward approach provides a strong baseline against which future work on reducing utility disparities of DP mechanisms should be compared.

AB Geomagnetic activities have a crucial impact on Earth, which can affect spacecraft and electrical power grids. Geospace scientists use a geomagnetic index, called the Kp index, to describe the overall level of geomagnetic activity. This index is an important indicator of disturbances in the Earth's magnetic field and is used by the U.S. Space Weather Prediction Center as an alert and warning service for users who may be affected by the disturbances. Early and accurate prediction of the Kp index is essential for preparedness and disaster risk management. In this paper, we present a novel deep learning method, named KpNet, to perform short-term, 1-9 hour ahead, forecasting of the Kp index based on the solar wind parameters taken from the NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive. KpNet combines transformer encoder blocks with Bayesian inference, which is capable of quantifying both aleatoric uncertainty (data uncertainty) and epistemic uncertainty (model uncertainty) when making Kp predictions. Experimental results show that KpNet outperforms closely related machine learning methods in terms of the root mean square error and R-squared score. Furthermore, KpNet can provide both data and model uncertainty quantification results, which the existing methods cannot offer. To our knowledge, this is the first time that Bayesian transformers have been used for Kp prediction.

AB In many disciplines, the growth of online courses was propelled by the COVID-19 pandemic, but this trend moderated as health concerns receded. Before the pandemic, computer science-related disciplines were less keen on online labs because of their inherently hands-on nature. This study presents a comparative analysis of student and faculty perceptions towards online labs in three computing-related disciplines a year after the pandemic. Through a survey with 242 students and 20 faculty responses, we found students were, overall, positive about their online lab experience-as were faculty. Students and instructors both agree that (1) where provided, online lab courses are being taught effectively, and (2) it is crucial to continue investing in technology infrastructure to enhance the quality and accessibility of both online and in-person labs. However, students and instructors disagree on two issues: (1) teamwork for lab activities and assignments (i.e., faculty tended to have a more optimistic view of online collaborative activities); and (2) modality for lab sessions (i.e., student preferences were evenly split between synchronous and asynchronous labs while faculty mostly preferred synchronous online labs). Faculty appear more optimistic about the effectiveness of online labs but show heightened concern regarding technological disruptions. Notably, all comments from students asserted the importance of having recorded demonstrations, even when a live synchronous demonstration may have been provided. Utilizing recordings and making them available is an example of a best practice worth promoting despite the added effort for faculty.

AB Wearable robot control in complicated contexts requires an understanding of human locomotion intent and behaviors. However, signals from human-robot interfaces are typically reliant on the user, leading to poor performance of the model trained on training user when applied to new end-point users. This study aims to address this problem by developing a novel Teacher-Student-Learning (TSL) approach using Heterogeneous Ensemble Hypotheses (HEH) to achieve unsupervised user-agnostic adaptation. The motivation behind using the Teacher-Student-Learning architecture is to leverage the diverse features extracted by HEH while maintaining computational efficiency. HEH reduces the difference between labeled training users and unlabeled end-point users by incorporating multiple diverse feature generators to extract a wide range of features, thereby increasing classification accuracy and reducing variance. However, this approach sacrifices efficiency due to the ensemble nature of HEH. To address this trade-off, the knowledge from HEH is distilled into a single network using TSL, ensuring precision and efficiency. The proposed approach is evaluated on two publicly available human locomotion datasets and a 2D moon dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, outperforming all other methods. Tested with three datasets, the proposed method can classify end-point users' data with an average accuracy of 98.9%, 96.7%, and 96.9% while yielding a low processing time (1 ms). Compared to a benchmark method, the suggested strategy improves the average accuracy by 1.5% and 7.2% for categorizing the target users' locomotor modes and stabilizes the learning curves. The proposed method represents a significant contribution to the field of human activity recognition and human intent prediction for human-robot interaction systems, enhancing the efficiency and generalization capacity of these systems.

AB T-type primary bridge-based resonant converters employed in unfolding-based single-stage ac-dc conversion systems commonly adopt a leading-edge aligned modulation strategy, as it facilitates zero-voltage switching (ZVS) throughout the grid cycle. However, the application of this modulation strategy can result in partial ZVS of the common-source mosfets within the T-type bridge. In this letter, we investigate the underlying reasoning of such partial ZVS, quantify the severity of the problem, and propose a mitigation solution. Specifically, an optimized leading-edge aligned modulation strategy is introduced, incorporating an intentional staggered time delay for the turn-off of the common-source mosfets during the leading edge. The proposed modulation strategy is validated through hardware testing on a 20-kW unfolding-based ac-dc conversion system.

AB Electrostatic discharge (ESD) failure is a major reliability problem for all forms of microelectronics products. ESD protection is required for all integrated circuits (ICs). As dimension scaling-down approaches its physical limit, heterogeneous integration (HI) emerges as a main pathway towards the age beyond Moore's Law to facilitate advanced microsystem chips with extreme performance and rich functionalities. Advanced packaging is a key requirement for HI-enabled integrated systems-on-chiplets (SoIC) that require robust ESD protection solutions. This article outlines key emerging technical challenges associated with smart future SoIC microsystem superchips in the context of advanced packaging technologies.

AB Conformal printing offers a promising capability to integrate complex electronic functionality with intricate objects consisting of curved surfaces. However, motion planning to support these printing configurations presents a challenge, in part due to conventional reliance on tessellated surface representations that limit the accuracy and scalability of the printing process. In this paper, we introduce a direct approach to conformal aerosol jet printing on topographically complex surfaces, represented using non -uniform rational B -splines (NURBS). Using the NURBS surface definition directly offers a scalable and continuous approach for toolpath generation, which is well -aligned with standard computer -aided design practices. We select a patch that directly corresponds to the area of interest on the NURBS surface and extract the associated surface points. These surface points are then appropriately connected to generate the machine code (G -code) for a 3 -axis printing system. We demonstrate this capability by printing a strain gauge on a curved model of a wind turbine blade. Our approach offers a promising avenue for manufacturing printed electronics with diverse applications that require conformal printing. This approach is particularly valuable for incorporating printed circuits on intricate underlying structures, including structural health monitoring for aerospace and civil infrastructure applications.

On the other hand, FPGAs are widely used as a hardware platform for these applications. Accordingly, energy-efficient and power analysis attack-resilient design for FPGA is required. This paper proposes an energy-efficient power analysis attack-resilient adiabatic nonvolatile hybrid MTJ/CMOS LiM-based CLB. The simulation results show that the proposed design has 98.72%, 98.72%, 98.69%, 98.61%, 98.43%, and 98.11% (at least 84.69%, 84.74%, 84.28%, 83.19%, 80.70%, and 77%) lower energy consumption compared to its CMOS counterpart (adiabatic counterparts) for frequencies of 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, and 40 MHz, respectively. Also, the proposed design keeps its energy consumption superiority for different TMR and power supply voltages, compared to its counterparts. The NED and NSD values of different designs have been calculated and used as power analysis attack-resiliency metrics. The results show that the proposed design has 1053x and 1628x (at least 23x and 14x) lower NED and NSD values compared to its CMOS counterpart (adiabatic counterparts). Furthermore, the NED and NSD values of the proposed design stay in the same range (10(-4)) for different frequencies, power supply voltages, and TMR.

AB Used in higher education for many decades, seed grants are now beginning to be applied as a strategy to advance diversity, equity and inclusion goals, including rebuilding community post-pandemic. There is little research on the effectiveness of seed grants for such communal goals. This work is innovative in two key ways. First, these seed grants focus on promoting a strong sense of community at the institution rather than promoting individual investigators and research projects. Second, engaging students and staff as principal investigators (PIs) disrupts power structures in the academy. We present a systematic analysis of seed grant project reports (n = 45) and survey data (n = 56) from two seed grant programs implemented at the same institution. A diverse set of projects was proposed and funded. Projects had a positive impact on awardees and their departments and colleges. Seed grant program activities were successful at building community among awardees and recognizing individual efforts. Most noteworthy are the career development opportunities for graduate students, postdocs and staff, which are afforded by changes to PI eligibility. We conclude that seed grant programs have the potential for organizational learning and change around community building in higher education.

AB The use of ductile concrete materials such as High Performance Fiber Reinforced Cementitious Composites (HPFRCCs) within plastic hinge regions of structural components has garnered research interest in order to improve the seismic resistance of reinforced concrete structures. While experimental and numerical results appear promising in reducing component damage and probability of system level collapse, accurate nonlinear analysis tools capable of capturing the influence of axial load well into a component's inelastic regime is needed. In this study, a series of 180 high fidelity numerical simulations of HPFRCC beam-column elements are simulated and used to calibrate new plastic hinge length expressions for concentrated and distributed plasticity models for use in system level structural analysis. The numerical models cover a range of HPFRCC material properties, reinforcement ratios, shear span lengths, and axial load levels. The ability of the newly developed expressions to predict component inelastic rotations are subsequently compared to hinge length expressions in the literature and the inelastic rotations of 47 experimental components. The results of this study provide new insights into the effects of axial load on the plastic hinge behavior of HPFRCC components, significantly improves on the accuracy of past plastic hinge length expressions allowing for more accurate modeling of HPFRCC component responses and system level behavior.

ID POLITICAL NEWS
AB Digital ads on social-media platforms play an important role in shaping access to economic opportunities. Our work proposes and implements a new third-party auditing method that can evaluate racial bias in the delivery of ads for education opportunities. Third-party auditing is important because it allows external parties to demonstrate presence or absence of bias in social-media algorithms. Education is a domain with legal protections against discrimination and concerns of racial-targeting, but bias induced by ad delivery algorithms has not been previously explored in this domain. Prior audits demonstrated discrimination in platforms' delivery of ads to users for housing and employment ads. These audit findings supported legal action that prompted Meta to change their ad-delivery algorithms to reduce bias, but only in the domains of housing, employment, and credit. In this work, we propose a new methodology that allows us to measure racial discrimination in a platform's ad delivery algorithms for education ads. We apply our method to Meta using ads for real schools and observe the results of delivery. We find evidence of racial discrimination in Meta's algorithmic delivery of ads for education opportunities, posing legal and ethical concerns. Our results extend evidence of algorithmic discrimination to the education domain, showing that current bias mitigation mechanisms are narrow in scope, and suggesting a broader role for third-party auditing of social media in areas where ensuring non-discrimination is important.

AB We provide new constraints on the dark matter halo density profile of Milky Way (MW) dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) using the phase-space distribution function (DF) method. After assessing the systematics of the approach against mock data from the Gaia Challenge project, we apply the DF analysis to the entire kinematic sample of well-measured MW dwarf satellites for the first time. Contrary to previous findings for some of these objects, we find that the DF analysis yields results consistent with the standard Jeans analysis. In particular, in this study we rediscover (i) a large diversity in the inner halo densities of dSphs (bracketed by Draco and Fornax), and (ii) an anticorrelation between inner halo density and pericenter distance of the bright MW satellites. Regardless of the strength of the anticorrelation, we find that the distribution of these satellites in density versus pericenter space is inconsistent with the results of the high-resolution N-body simulations that include a disc potential. Our analysis motivates further studies on the role of internal feedback and dark matter microphysics in these dSphs.

AB Creating accessible software is imperative for making software inclusive for all users.Unfortunately, the topic of accessibility is frequently excluded from computing education, leading to scenarios where students are unaware of either how to develop accessible software or see the need to create it. To address this challenge, we have created a set of educational labs that are systematically designed to not only inform students about fundamental topics in producing accessible software but also demonstrate its importance. Over the previous year, these labs were included in several Computer Science 2 offerings at the Rochester Institute of Technology, comprising a total of 500 student participants. This article discusses instructional observations from these offerings, some of which include the following: (i) many of the research findings from previous efforts remain true with the larger, more diverse evaluation; (ii) our created material and format reduced students' belief that creating accessible software was difficult in relation to the baseline,; (iii) we observed that our created material and format benefited student opinion that creating accessible software is important, and (iv) computing majors may not be uniformly impacted by experiential educational accessibility material. The educational labs are publicly available on the project website (https://all.rit.edu).

DE Equitable grading; grading for equity; grading practices
ID PROFESSIONAL-DEVELOPMENT
AB It is often the case that computer science classrooms use traditional grading practices where points are allocated to assignments, mistakes result in point deductions, and assignment scores are combined using some form of weighted averaging to determine grades. Unfortunately, traditional grading practices have been shown to reduce achievement, discourage students, and suppress effort to such an extent that some common elements of traditional grading practices have been termed toxic. Using grades to reward or punish student behavior does not encourage learning and instead increases anxiety and stress. These toxic elements are present throughout computing education and computer science classrooms in the form of late penalties, lack of credit for code that doesn't compile or pass certain unit tests, among others. These types of metrics, that evaluate behavior are often influenced by implicit bias, factors outside of the classrooms (e.g., part-time employment), and family life situations (e.g., students who are caregivers). Often, students in these situations are disproportionately from low-socioeconomic backgrounds and predominantly students of color. Through this paper, we will present a case for adoption of equitable grading practices and a call for additional support in classroom and teaching technologies as well as support from administrations both at the department and university level. By adopting a community of practice approach, we argue that we can support new faculty making these changes, which would be more equitable and inclusive. Further, these practices have been shown to better support student learning and can help increase student learning gains and retention.

AB The goal of this stydy was to explore the potential of the enhanced corrosion resistance of Ti(N,O) cathodic arc evaporation-coated 304L stainless steel using oxide nano-layers deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD). In this study, we deposited Al2O3, ZrO2, and HfO2 nanolayers of two different thicknesses by ALD onto Ti(N,O)-coated 304L stainless steel surfaces. XRD, EDS, SEM, surface profilometry, and voltammetry investigations of the anticorrosion properties of the coated samples are reported. The amorphous oxide nanolayers homogeneously deposited on the sample surfaces exhibited lower roughness after corrosion attack compared to the Ti(N,O)-coated stainless steel. The best corrosion resistance was obtained for the thickest oxide layers. All samples coated with thicker oxide nanolayers augmented the corrosion resistance of the Ti(N,O)-coated stainless steel in a saline, acidic, and oxidising environment (0.9% NaCl + 6% H2O2, pH = 4), which is of interest for building corrosion-resistant housings for advanced oxidation systems such as cavitation and plasma-related electrochemical dielectric barrier discharge for breaking down persistent organic pollutants in water.

AB Federated Learning (FL) provides enhanced privacy over traditional centralized learning; unfortunately, it is also as susceptible to backdoor attacks, just like its centralized counterpart. Conventionally, in data poisoning-based backdoor attacks, all the malicious participants overlay the same single trigger pattern on a subset of their private data during local training. The same trigger is used to induce the backdoor in the otherwise benign global model at inference time. Such single trigger attacks can be detected and removed with relative ease as they undermine the distributed nature of FL. In this work, we focus on building an attack scheme where each batch of malicious clients uses sizably discrete local triggers during local training, with the ability to invoke the attack with a single small inference trigger during the global model testing. The larger size of the trigger pattern ensures prolonged attack longevity even after the termination of the attack. We conduct extensive experiments to show that our approach is far faster, stealthier, and more effective than the centralized trigger approach. The stealthiness of our work is explained using the DeepLIFT visual feature interpretation method.

AB Aniline-related structures are common in anthropogenic chemicals, such as pharmaceuticals and pesticides. Compared with the widely studied phenolic compounds, anilines have received far less assessment of their disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation potential, even though anilines and phenols likely exhibit similar reactivities on their respective aromatic rings. In this study, a suite of 19 aniline compounds with varying N- and ring-substitutions were evaluated for their formation potentials of haloacetonitriles and trihalomethanes under free chlorination and free bromination conditions. Eight of the aniline compounds formed dichloroacetonitrile at yields above 0.50%; the highest yields were observed for 4-nitroaniline, 3-chloroaniline, and 4-(methylsulfonyl)aniline (1.6-2.3%). Free bromination generally resulted in greater haloacetonitrile yields with the highest yield observed for 2-ethylaniline (6.5%). The trihalomethane yields of anilines correlated with their haloacetonitrile yields. Product analysis of aniline chlorination by liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry revealed several large-molecule DBPs, including chloroanilines, (chloro)hydroxyanilines, (chloro)benzoquinone imines, and ring-cleavage products. The product time profiles suggested that the reaction pathways include initial ring chlorination and hydroxylation, followed by the formation of benzoquinone imines that eventually led to ring cleavage. This work revealed the potential of aniline-related moieties in micropollutants as potent precursors to haloacetonitriles and other emerging large-molecule DBPs with the expected toxicity.

AB We investigate the connection between galaxies, dark matter halos, and their large-scale environments at z = 0 with Illustris TNG300 hydrodynamic simulation data. We predict stellar masses from subhalo properties to test two types of machine learning (ML) models: explainable boosting machines (EBMs) with simple galaxy environment features and E(3) -invariant graph neural networks (GNNs). The best-performing EBM models leverage spherically averaged overdensity features on 3 Mpc scales. Interpretations via SHapley Additive exPlanations also suggest that in the context of the TNG300 galaxy-halo connection, simple spherical overdensity on similar to 3 Mpc scales is more important than cosmic web distance features measured using the DisPerSE algorithm. Meanwhile, a GNN with connectivity defined by a fixed linking length, L, outperforms the EBM models by a significant margin. As we increase the linking length scale, GNNs learn important environmental contributions up to the largest scales we probe (L = 10 Mpc). We conclude that 3 Mpc distance scales are most critical for describing the TNG galaxy-halo connection using the spherical overdensity parameterization, but that information on larger scales, which is not captured by simple environmental parameters or cosmic web features, can further augment these models. Our study highlights the benefits of using interpretable ML algorithms to explain models of astrophysical phenomena, and the power of using GNNs to flexibly learn complex relationships directly from data while imposing constraints from physical symmetries.

AB 2D and 3D porous coordination networks (PCNs) as exemplified by metal-organic frameworks, MOFs, have garnered interest for their potential utility as sorbents for molecular separations and storage. The inherent modularity of PCNs has enabled the development of crystal engineering strategies for systematic fine-tuning of pore size and chemistry in families of related PCNs. The same cannot be said about one-dimensional (1D) coordination polymers, CPs, which are understudied with respect to porosity. Here, we report that permanent porosity is exhibited by the previously reported family of linear (L) 1D porous CPs, PCPs, of formula [M(bipy)(NO3)(2)(H2O)(2)]n (L-chn-1-M-NO3: M = Co, Ni; bipy = 4,4 '-bipyridine). Their pore structure comprises 1D channels sustained by three types of directional interaction: coordination bonds; hydrogen bonds; offset pi-pi interactions. Heating L-chn-1-M-NO3 in vacuo or above 383 K resulted in removal of the aqua ligands and concomitant transformation to nonporous anhydrate phases ZZ-chn-1-Co-NO3 (ZZ = zigzag) and HT-Ni. Exposure of these anhydrate phases to ambient humidity resulted in regeneration of L-chn-1-M-NO3. That L-chn-1-M-NO3 exhibits permanent porosity was supported by CO2 and water sorption measurements, which afforded reversible type I and stepped (S-shaped) isotherm profiles, respectively, making this work the first demonstration of reversible water sorption in a 1D PCP. The water sorption properties are pertinent to atmospheric water harvesting: onset of uptake at ca. 12% relative humidity; activation required only mild heat or vacuum; relatively fast adsorption/desorption kinetics; performance retained over >100 adsorption/desorption cycles. We project water harvesting productivity of L-chn-1-M-NO3 of 3.3 L kg(-1) d(-1), on par with some leading MOF desiccants. DFT and Monte Carlo simulations provide insights into the structure of water molecules in the channels, provide their influence on the host framework, and provide a plausible argument for the experimental water vapor isotherms. This work demonstrates that easily scalable 1D PCPs, a potentially vast class of materials, can exhibit porous structures sustained by three types of directional supramolecular synthons and offer desirable water sorption properties.

AB Additive manufacturing (AM) has recently emerged as the go-to technology for producing high-quality metal components to address cutting-edge research and industrial challenges. However, existing metal AM technologies operate on a layer-by-layer basis, giving rise to undesirable "staircasing effects" that result in the anisotropic behavior. Additionally, conventional metal printing methods are constrained by printing times, expensive hardware, and limited resolution control. In response to these limitations, this work is dedicated to the development of a cost-effective, ultra-fast layerless metal AM process for crafting intricate 3D metal structures. Low viscous resin was developed to enable continuous printing of metal precursors via mask video projection-based vat photopolymerization, which enable tunable physical properties and superior surface quality. Based on experimental findings, high-density meso- and microscale metallic parts can be printed at speeds orders of magnitude faster than commercial metal AM technologies. Furthermore, printed metallic components display a uniform morphology and microstructure with consistent grain size distribution. A comparative analysis of the surface quality between layer-based and layer-less printed metal structures were conducted. This work has the potential to revolutionize not only the field of AM but also various industries reliant on high-quality metal components, such as aerospace, automotive, and medical devices.

AB In this study, we utilize data from over 28,000 public charging stations (PCSs) and 5.5 million points of interest across twenty U.S. metropolitan areas to underscore the importance of considering the availability of daily activity opportunities when assessing accessibility to PCSs, rather than relying solely on spatial proximity. Specifically, we conduct comprehensive comparisons of opportunity -centric accessibility measures with distance -based measures and perform counterfactual analyses under various PCS deployment strategies. Our findings reveal significant inequalities in PCS access across different neighborhoods under distance -based and opportunitycentric measures. However, a greater disparity exists when considering opportunities, with high -income communities having significantly better access to PCSs. Counterfactual analyses suggest that equitable deployment based on distance measures results in the least equitable outcomes when considering opportunities, primarily due to the existing disparity in opportunity distributions in our cities. Our insights highlight the complexity of locating PCSs and can guide nationwide PCS deployment for long-term societal benefits.

AB Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have revolutionized numerous application domains with their unparalleled performance. As the models become larger and more complex, hardware DNN accelerators are increasingly popular. Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)-based DNN accelerators offer near-Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) efficiency and exceptional flexibility, establishing them as one of the primary hardware platforms for rapidly evolving deep learning implementations, particularly on edge devices. This prominence renders them lucrative targets for attackers. Existing attacks aimed at compromising the confidentiality of DNN models deployed on FPGA DNN accelerators often assume complete knowledge of the accelerators. However, this assumption does not hold for real-world, proprietary, high-performance FPGA DNN accelerators. In this study, we introduce a comprehensive and effective reverse-engineering methodology for demystifying FPGA DNN accelerator soft Intellectual Property (IP) cores. We demonstrate its application on the cutting-edge AMD-Xilinx Deep Learning Processing Unit (DPU). Our method relies on schematic analysis and, innovatively, electromagnetic (EM) side-channel analysis to reveal the data flow and scheduling of the DNN accelerators. To the best of our knowledge, this research is the first successful endeavor to reverse-engineer a commercial encrypted DNN accelerator IP. Moreover, we investigate attack surfaces exposed by the reverse-engineering findings, including the successful recovery of DNN model architectures and extraction of model parameters. These outcomes pose a significant threat to real-world commercial FPGA-DNN acceleration systems. We discuss potential countermeasures and offer recommendations for FPGA-based IP protection.

AB Diversity, group representation, and similar needs often apply to query results, which in turn require constraints on the sizes of various subgroups in the result set. Traditional relational queries only specify conditions as part of the query predicate(s), and do not support such restrictions on the output. In this paper, we study the problem of modifying queries to have the result satisfy constraints on the sizes of multiple subgroups in it. This problem, in the worst case, cannot be solved in polynomial time. Yet, with the help of provenance annotation, we are able to develop a query refinement method that works quite efficiently, as we demonstrate through extensive experiments.

DE data privacy; autonomous vehicles; deep learning; edge computing
AB With the wider adoption of edge computing services, intelligent edge devices, and high-speed V2X communication, compute-intensive tasks for autonomous vehicles, such as object detection using camera, LiDAR, and/or radar data, can be partially offloaded to road-side edge servers. However, data privacy becomes a major concern for vehicular edge computing, as sensitive sensor data from vehicles can be observed and used by edge servers. We aim to address the privacy problem by protecting both vehicles' sensor data and the detection results. In this paper, we present vehicle-edge cooperative deep-learning networks with privacy protection for object-detection tasks, named vePOD for short. In vePOD, we leverage the additive secret sharing theory to develop secure functions for every layer in an object-detection convolutional neural network (CNN). A vehicle's sensor data is split and encrypted into multiple secret shares, each of which is processed on an edge server by going through the secure layers of a detection network. The detection results can only be obtained by combining the partial results from the participating edge servers. We have developed proof-of-concept detection networks with secure layers: vePOD Faster R-CNN (two-stage detection) and vePOD YOLO (single-stage detection). Experimental results on public datasets show that vePOD does not degrade the accuracy of object detection and, most importantly, it protects data privacy for vehicles. The execution of a vePOD object-detection network with secure layers is orders of magnitude faster than the existing approaches for data privacy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that targets privacy protection in object-detection tasks with vehicle-edge cooperative computing.

AB To fulfill their conservation potential and provide safeguards for biodiversity, marine protected areas (MPAs) need coordinated research and monitoring for informed management through effective evaluation of ecosystem dynamics. However, coordination is challenging, often due to knowledge gaps caused by inadequate access to data and resources, compounded by insufficient communication between scientists and managers. We propose to use the world's largest MPA in the Ross Sea, Antarctica as a model system to create a comprehensive framework for an interdisciplinary network supporting research and monitoring that could be implemented in other remote large-scale international MPAs. Our proposed framework has three key components: (i) policy engagement, including delineation of policy needs and ecosystem metrics to assess MPA effectiveness; (ii) community partner engagement to elevate diverse voices, build trust, and share resources; and (iii) integrated science comprising three themes. These themes are: advancement of data science and cyberinfrastructure to facilitate data synthesis and sharing; biophysical modeling towards understanding ecosystem changes and uncertainties; and execution of observational and process studies to address uncertainties and evaluate ecosystem metrics. This proposed framework can improve MPA implementation by generating policy-relevant science through this coordinated network, which can in turn improve MPA effectiveness in the Ross Sea and beyond.

AB Whereas light-element abundance variations are a hallmark of globular clusters, there is little evidence for variations in neutron-capture elements. A significant exception is M15, which shows a star-to-star dispersion in neutron-capture abundances of at least one order of magnitude. The literature contains evidence both for and against a neutron-capture dispersion in M92. We conducted an analysis of archival Keck/HIRES spectra of 35 stars in M92, 29 of which are giants, which we use exclusively for our conclusions. M92 conforms to the abundance variations typical of massive clusters. Like other globular clusters, its neutron-capture abundances were generated by the r-process. We confirm a star-to-star dispersion in r-process abundances. Unlike M15, the dispersion is limited to "first-generation" (low-Na, high-Mg) stars, and the dispersion is smaller for Sr, Y, and Zr than for Ba and the lanthanides. This is the first detection of a relation between light-element and neutron-capture abundances in a globular cluster. We propose that a source of the main r-process polluted the cluster shortly before or concurrently with the first generation of star formation. The heavier r-process abundances were inhomogeneously distributed while the first-generation stars were forming. The second-generation stars formed after several crossing times (similar to 0.8 Myr); hence, the second generation shows no r-process dispersion. This scenario imposes a minimum temporal separation of 0.8 Myr between the first and second generations.

ID CONFIGURATION
AB The study of the impedance mismatch between the device and its surroundings is crucial when building an acoustic device to obtain optimal performance. In reality, a high impedance mismatch would prohibit energy from being transmitted over the interface, limiting the amount of energy that the device could treat. In general, this is solved by using acoustic impedance matching layers, such as gradients, similar to what is done in optical coatings. The simplest form of such a gradient can be considered as an intermediate layer with certain qualities resting between the two media to impedance match, and requiring a minimum thickness of at least one quarter wavelength of the lowest frequency under consideration. The desired combination(s) of the (limited) available elastic characteristics and densities has traditionally determined material selection. Nature, which is likewise limited by the use of a limited number of materials in the construction of biological structures, demonstrates a distinct approach in which the design space is swept by modifying certain geometrical and/or material parameters. The middle ear of mammals and the lateral line of fishes are both instances of this method, with the latter already incorporating an architecture of distributed impedance matched underwater layers. In this paper, we develop a resonant mechanism whose properties can be modified to give impedance matching at different frequencies by adjusting a small set of geometrical parameters. The mechanism in question, like the lateral line organ, is intended to serve as the foundation for the creation of an impedance matching meta-surface. A computational study and parameter optimization show that it can match the impedance of water and air in a deeply sub-wavelength zone.

AB Superparamagnetic Ni-ferrite and their composite with graphene oxide nanoparticles are synthesized using simple hydrothermal method. The morphology and the crystal structure measurements show formation of spinel structure with cubic/octahedral shape nanoparticles with average particles size of 16.63 nm and 12.87 nm for NiFe2O4 and GO-NiFe2O4 respectively. The magnetic properties show superparamagnetic behavior at room temperature with saturation magnetization of 50 and 35 emu/g and Coercivity of 35 and 25 Oe for NiFe2O4 and GO-NiFe2O4 respectively. The zero-field cooling and field cooling magnetization dependence on tem-perature measurements yield blocking temperature of 315 and 257 K for NiFe2O4 and GO-NiFe2O4 respectively. Those values confirm the superparamagnetic behavior of the samples. Moreover, the blocking temperature of the NiFe2O4 is within the therapeutic temperature range of magnetic hyperthermia therapy. The feasibility of hyperthermia reveals heating power of 165 and 15 W/g for NiFe2O4 and GO-NiFe2O4 respectively, which is comparable and even much better than the previous published work by others. Therefore, the findings open new route for the potential of NiFe2O4 and GO-NiFe2O4 nanoparticles for hyperthermia and to be tested for in vitro/ in vivo hyperthermia in the future.

AB We present a model-independent reconstruction of the early expansion and thermal histories of the Universe, obtained from light element abundance measurements. The expansion history is tightly constrained around the onset of the big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). The temperature of photons is additionally constrained around the time of neutrino decoupling. Allowing for perturbations to the standard expansion rate, we find that the radiation energy density is constrained to within 15% of its Lambda CDM value, and only 1% extra matter energy density is allowed around the epoch of BBN. We introduce a new and general analytic fitting formula for the temperature variation, which is flexible enough to reproduce the signal of large classes of beyond-CDM particle models that can alter the temperature through early-time energy injection. We present its constraints from BBN data and from the measurements of effective number of relativistic species and helium-4 abundance probed by the cosmic microwave background radiation anisotropy. Our results provide clarity on the most fundamental properties of the early Universe, reconstructed with minimal assumptions about the unknown physics that can occur at keV-MeV energy scales and can be mapped to broad classes of models of interest to cosmology.

AB Depression is one of the leading mental health concerns among science undergraduates, and rates of student depression increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Revealing one's depression in an academic science environment can be helpful, because it can result in increased support from others. However, depression is considered a concealable stigma-tized identity, meaning that it can be kept hidden and may carry a stigma. A national piv-ot to online learning owing to COVID-19 not only increased the need to bolster student mental health, but also presented a novel learning environment. However, it is unclear to what extent students revealed their depression in science courses and why. We surveyed 1179 undergraduates with depression at a research-intensive institution about whether they had revealed their depression to an online college science instructor. Very few under-graduates (5.9%) had revealed their depression to online science instructors; students who identify as LGBTQ+, have lower grade point averages, or experience more severe depres-sion were more likely to reveal their depression to an instructor. Undergraduates reported potential benefits from doing so, including building a connection with the instructor and receiving accommodations. This work provides insight into steps science instructors can take to foster inclusive course environments for students with depression.

AB Single crystals of U2Mn3Ge and U2Fe3Ge with a Kagome lattice structure were synthesized using a high-temperature self-flux crystal growth method. The physical properties of these crystals were characterized through measurements of resistivity, magnetism, and specific heat. U2Fe3Ge exhibits ferromagnetic ground state and anomalous Hall effect, and U2Mn3Ge demonstrates a complex magnetic structure. Both compounds exhibit large Sommerfeld coefficient, indicating coexistence of heavy Fermion behaviour with magnetism. Our results suggest that this U2TM3Ge (TM = Mn, Fe, Co) family is a promising platform to investigate the interplay of magnetism, Kondo physics and the Kagome lattice.

AB Post-stroke upper extremity function can be improved by devices that support shoulder abduction. However, many of these devices provide limited assistance in activities of daily living due to their complexity and encumbrance. We developed and evaluated a passive, lightweight (0.6 kg) wearable device consisting of an aluminum frame and elastic bands attached to a posture vest to aid in shoulder abduction. The number and thickness of bands can be adjusted to provide supportive forces to the affected arm. We measured reachable workspace area and Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) performance in people with a history of stroke (n = 11) with and without the wearable. The device increased workspace area in 6 participants and improved average WMFT functional and timing scores in 7 and 12 tasks, respectively, out of 16 total tasks. On average, participants increased their arm motion within 20 cm of shoulder level by 22.4% and decreased their hand's average distance from trunk by 15.2%, both improvements in the device case.

AB This paper introduces a scalable computational framework for optimal design under high dimensional uncertainty, with application to thermal insulation components. The thermal and mechanical behaviors are described by continuum multi-phase models of porous materials governed by partial differential equations (PDEs), and the design parameter, material porosity, is an uncertain and spatially correlated field. After finite element discretization, these factors lead to a high-dimensional PDE-constrained optimization problem. The framework employs a risk-averse formulation that accounts for both the mean and variance of the design objectives. It incorporates two regularization techniques, the l(0)-norm and phase field functionals, implemented using continuation numerical schemes to promote spatial sparsity in the design parameters. To ensure efficiency, the framework utilizes a second-order Taylor approximation for the mean and variance and exploits the low-rank structure of the preconditioned Hessian of the design objective. This results in computational costs that are determined by the rank of preconditioned Hessian, remaining independent of the number of uncertain parameters. The accuracy, scalability with respect to the parameter dimension, and sparsity-promoting abilities of the framework are assessed through numerical examples involving various building insulation components.

TI Excited-state dynamics and optically detected magnetic resonance of
   solid-state spin defects from first principles
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
LA English
DT Article
ID ENTANGLEMENT; TRANSITION; BAND
AB Optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) is an efficient and reliable method that enables initialization and readout of spin states through the spin-photon interface. In general, high quantum efficiency and large spin-dependent photoluminescence contrast are desirable for reliable quantum information readout. However, reliable prediction of the ODMR contrast from first-principles requires an accurate description of complex spin polarization mechanisms of spin defects. These mechanisms often include multiple radiative and nonradiative processes, in particular, intersystem crossing (ISC) among multiple excited electronic states. In this work, we present our implementation of the first-principles ODMR contrast by solving the kinetic master equation with calculated rates from ab initio electronic structure methods then benchmark the implementation on the case of the negatively charged nitrogen vacancy center in diamond. We show the importance of the correct description of multireference electronic states and pseudo Jahn-Teller effect for quantitatively, even qualitatively correct prediction of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and the rate of ISC. We present the complete calculation of SOC for different ISC processes that align with both group theory and experimental observations. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive picture of excitation and relaxation dynamics, including previously unexplored internal conversion processes. We show good agreement between our first-principles calculations and the experimental ODMR contrast under magnetic field. We then demonstrate reliable predictions of magnetic field direction, pump power, and Rabi frequency as important parameters for ODMR experiments. Our work clarifies the important excited-state relaxation mechanisms determining ODMR contrast and provides a predictive computational platform for spin polarization and optical readout of solid-state quantum defects from first principles.

AB Large eddy simulations (LES) are widely used to study the effects of surface morphology on turbulence statistics, exchange processes and turbulence topology in urban canopies. However, as LES are only approximations of reality, special attention is needed for the computational model set-up to ensure an accurate representation of the physical processes of interest. This paper shows that the choice of the numerical domain can significantly affect the accuracy of turbulent flow statistics, potentially causing a mismatch between numerical studies and experimental data. The study examines the influence of cross-stream aspect ratio (YAR), streamwise aspect ratio (XAR) and scale separation (SS) on first- and second-order flow statistics and turbulence topology. It is found that domains with a low YAR underestimate the velocity variance, while those with a low XAR overestimate the variance value. The study proposes a new approach based on the Buckingham Pi theorem to evaluate the effect of SS, as the existing method has major limitations for canopy flows. The results suggest that domains with small SS underpredict the variance value. To minimise the artificial impact of the numerical domain on turbulent flow statistics, the study recommends guidelines for future research, including a YAR of 3 or more, an XAR of 6 or more and an SS of 12 or more. Error tables are presented to allow researchers to select smaller domains than recommended, depending on their research interests in specific parts of the flow.

AB Peer review is a core component of scientific practice. Although peer review ideally improves research and promotes rigor, it also has consequences for what types of research are published and cited and who wants to (and is able to) advance in research-focused careers. Despite these consequences, few reviewers or editors receive training or oversight to ensure their feedback is helpful, professional, and culturally sensitive. Here, we critically examine the peer-review system in psychology and neuroscience at multiple levels, from ideas to institutions, interactions, and individuals. We highlight initiatives that aim to change the normative negativity of peer review and provide authors with constructive, actionable feedback that is sensitive to diverse identities, methods, topics, and environments. We conclude with a call to action for how individuals, groups, and organizations can improve the culture of peer review. We provide examples of how changes in the peer-review system can be made with an eye to diversity (increasing the range of identities and experiences constituting the field), equity (fair processes and outcomes across groups), and inclusion (experiences that promote belonging across groups). These changes can improve scientists' experience of peer review, promote diverse perspectives and identities, and enhance the quality and impact of science. Public Significance Statement The peer-review process is a crucial aspect of scientific research that influences the quality of published work and the career trajectories of researchers. This article critically examines the current peer-review system, highlighting initiatives that aim to foster a more constructive, inclusive, and equitable review culture. By embracing these changes, the scientific community can better support diverse perspectives, enhance research quality, and create a more inclusive environment for scientists from all backgrounds. Implementing these recommendations holds the potential to benefit not only individual researchers but also the broader scientific enterprise and society as a whole.

AB This paper studies the multi-agent coverage control (MAC) problem where agents must dynamically learn an unknown density function while performing coverage tasks. Unlike many current theoretical frameworks that concentrate solely on the regret occurring at specific targeted sensory locations, our approach additionally considers the regret caused by transient behavior - the path from one location and another. We propose the multi-agent coverage control with the doubling trick (MAC-DT) algorithm and demonstrate that it achieves (approximated) regret of (O) over tilde(root T) even when accounting for the transient behavior. Our result is also supported by numerical experiments, showcasing that the proposed algorithm manages to match or even outperform the baseline algorithms in simulation environments. We also show how our algorithm can be modified to handle safety constraints and further implement the algorithm on a real-robotic testbed.

AB The all pairs shortest path problem (APSP) is one of the foundational problems in computer science. For weighted dense graphs on n vertices, no truly sub-cubic algorithms exist to compute APSP exactly even for undirected graphs. This is popularly known as the APSP conjecture and has played a prominent role in developing the field of fine-grained complexity. The seminal results of Seidel and Zwick show that using fast matrix multiplication (FMM) it is possible to compute APSP on unweighted undirected graphs exactly in (O) over tilde (n(omega)) time, and can be approximated within (1 + epsilon) factor in weighted undirected graphs in time (O) over tilde (n(omega)) respectively. Here omega is the exponent of FMM, which currently stands at omega = 2.37188. Moreover even for unweighted undirected graphs, it is not possible to obtain a (2 - epsilon)-multiplicative approximation of APSP for any epsilon > 0 in o(n(omega)) time. Since 2000, a result by Dor, Halperin, and Zwick gave the best 2 approximation algorithm for APSP in unweighted undirected graphs in time (O) over tilde (n(7/3)). This result was recently improved by Deng, Kirkpatrick, Rong, Williams and Zhong to (O) over tilde (n(2.2593)) using fast min-plus product for bounded-difference matrices which uses FMM as a subroutine (the stated bound here uses new results for computing such min-plus products by Durr). In fact both these results obtain a +2-additive approximation. Recently, Roditty (STOC, 2023) improved the previous bounds for multiplicative 2-approximation of APSP in unweighted undirected graphs giving the best known bound of (O) over tilde (n(2.25)). All these algorithms are deterministic. Roditty also considers estimating shortest paths for all paths of length >= k for k >= 4, and gives improved bounds when the underlying graph is sparse using randomization. Though for dense graphs, the best known bounds still remained at those provided by Dor et al. more than two decades back.
   In this paper, we provide a multitude of new results for multiplicative and additive approximations of APSP in undirected graphs for both unweighted and weighted cases. We provide new algorithms for multiplicative 2-approximation of unweighted graphs: a deterministic one that runs in (O) over tilde (n(2.072)) time and a randomized one that runs in (O) over tilde (n(2.0318)) on expectation improving upon the best known bound of (O) over tilde (n(2.25)). The algorithm uses FMM as well as new combinatorial insights. For 2-approximating paths of length >= k, k >= 4, we provide the first improvement after Dor et al. for dense graphs even just using combinatorial methods, and then improve it further using FMM. We next consider additive approximations, and provide improved bounds for all additive beta-approximations, beta >= 4. For example, we achieve a running time of (O) over tilde (n(2.155)) for +4 additive approximation improving over the previously known bound of (O) over tilde (n(2.2)), and for a +6 additive approximation, our algorithm has a running time of (O) over tilde (n(2.103)) as opposed to the (O) over tilde (n(2.125)) time that was previously known. For weighted graphs, we show that by allowing small additive errors along with an (1 + epsilon)-multiplicative approximation, it is possible to improve upon Zwick's (O) over tilde (n(omega)) algorithm. For example, it is possible to obtain a bi-criteria (1 + epsilon, 2w(u,v)) approximation in (O) over tilde (n(2.152)) time for the shortest path distance between all vertex pairs u, v where w(u,v) is the highest weight edge on the u-v shortest path. Additionally, we provide a landscape of such bi-criteria approximations for weighted and unweighted graphs. Our results point out the crucial role that FMM can play even on approximating APSP on unweighted undirected graphs, and reveal new bottlenecks towards achieving a quadratic running time to approximate APSP.

DT Article
AB We develop a classical shadow tomography protocol utilizing the randomized measurement scheme based on hybrid quantum circuits, which consist of layers of two-qubit random Clifford unitary gates mixed with singlequbit random Pauli measurements. Unlike conventional protocols that perform all measurements by the end of unitary evolutions, our protocol allows measurements to occur at any space-time position throughout the quantum evolution. We provide a universal classical post-processing strategy to approximately reconstruct the original quantum state from intermittent measurement outcomes given the corresponding random circuit realizations over repeated experiments. We investigated the sample complexity for estimating different observables at different measurement rates of the hybrid quantum circuits. Our result shows that the sample complexity has an optimal scaling at the critical measurement rate when the hybrid circuit undergoes the measurement-induced transition.

AB Toxin/antitoxin (TA) systems are present in nearly every prokaryotic genome and play the important physiological roles of phage inhibition by reducing metabo lism (this includes persistence for the extreme case of complete cessation of metabo lism), genetic element stabilization, and biofilm formation. TA systems have also been incorporated into other cell systems, such as CRISPR-Cas and phage quorum sensing. For the simplest and best-studied case, proteinaceous toxins and antitoxins (i.e., type II), toxin activity is masked by direct binding of the antitoxin. A long-standing, unre solved question in the TA field is how toxins are activated when bound to antitoxins at nanomolar affinity. The current paradigm envisions preferential degradation of the antitoxin by a protease, but this is highly unlikely in that a protease cannot discrimi nate between bound toxin and bound antitoxin because both are highly structured. Strikingly, recent results from several studies show one likely mechanism for toxin activation is conformational changes in the TA complex that result in the release or activation of the toxin as a result of a protein trigger, such as that from phages, and as a result of thermally-driven refolding dynamics.

AB As event-based social networks (EBSNs) such as Meetup.com and Facebook Events gain popularity in managing local events (e.g., farmers' markets and social gatherings), two-sided cultural niches are created as event organizers and participants benefit from the platform while affecting each other. Among various factors, niche overlap, an ecological feature, has been studied as a key factor that shapes the success of online communities. While such ecological factors may also shape EBSN-based local groups' success, the context of EBSNs raises unique challenges in understanding the roles of cultural niches due to the informal nature of the local groups and their geographical embeddedness. In this paper, we examine the effects of Meetup groups' topic overlap and geospatial correlation on the activity levels of both organizers and participants, using one-year Meetup data for 500 cities in the United States. We find that (1) a group's topic overlap with other groups on EBSN is associated with its activity levels, and (2) local groups' geospatial correlation may moderate the effects of topic overlap for EBSN users, but inconsistently. The results provide a baseline understanding of EBSN-based groups from an ecological perspective.

TI Shear-driven stability of a rigid particle in yield stress fluids
SO PHYSICS OF FLUIDS

DT Article
ID SEDIMENTATION; MICROSTRUCTURE; DYNAMICS; SPHERE; MOTION; FLOWS
AB The stability of a rigid particle in yield stress fluids, comprised of soft particle glasses (SPGs), is investigated in shear flow under an applied external force, such as weight, using particle dynamics simulations. Results provide the critical force threshold, in terms of the dynamic yield stress and the flow strength, required to initiate sedimentation of the rigid particle over a wide range of shear rates and volume fractions. The streamlines of the SPGs show local disturbances when the rigid particle settles. The form of these disturbances is consistent with the microdynamics and microstructure response of the neighboring soft particles of the sedimenting rigid particle. Sedimenting particle induces non-affine displacement to the suspensions at low shear rates and high applied forces, while these dynamical events are localized and suppressed at high shear rates. Stability diagrams, which provide the conditions of the sedimentation of the rigid particle, are presented in terms of the applied force and the shear rate. These individual stability diagrams at each volume fraction map onto a universal stability diagram when the external force is scaled by the dynamic yield stress and shear rate with a ratio of the solvent viscosity to the low-frequency modulus of the SPGs.

AB What makes faces seem trustworthy? We investigated how racial prejudice predicts the extent to which perceivers employ racially prototypical cues to infer trustworthiness from faces. We constructed participant-level computational models of trustworthiness and White-to-Black prototypicality from U.S. college students' judgments of White (Study 1, N = 206) and Black-White morphed (Study 3, N = 386) synthetic faces. Although the average relationships between models differed across stimuli, both studies revealed that as participants' anti-Black prejudice increased and/or intergroup contact decreased, so too did participants' tendency to conflate White prototypical features with trustworthiness and Black prototypical features with untrustworthiness. Study 2 (N = 324) and Study 4 (N = 397) corroborated that untrustworthy faces constructed from participants with pro-White preferences appeared more Black prototypical to naive U.S. adults, relative to untrustworthy faces modeled from other participants. This work highlights the important role of racial biases in shaping impressions of facial trustworthiness.

AB Formal certification of Neural Networks (NNs) is crucial for ensuring their safety, fairness, and robustness. Unfortunately, on the one hand, sound and complete certification algorithms of ReLU-based NNs do not scale to large-scale NNs. On the other hand, incomplete certification algorithms are easier to compute, but they result in loose bounds that deteriorate with the depth of NN, which diminishes their effectiveness. In this paper, we ask the following question; can we replace the ReLU activation function with one that opens the door to incomplete certification algorithms that are easy to compute but can produce tight bounds on the NN's outputs? We introduce DeepBern-Nets, a class of NNs with activation functions based on Bernstein polynomials instead of the commonly used ReLU activation. Bernstein polynomials are smooth and differentiable functions with desirable properties such as the so-called range enclosure and subdivision properties. We design a novel Interval Bound Propagation (IBP) algorithm, called Bern-IBP, to efficiently compute tight bounds on DeepBern-Nets outputs. Our approach leverages the properties of Bernstein polynomials to improve the tractability of neural network certification tasks while maintaining the accuracy of the trained networks. We conduct experiments in adversarial robustness and reachability analysis settings to assess the effectiveness of the approach. Our proposed framework achieves high certified accuracy for adversarially-trained NNs, which is often a challenging task for certifiers of ReLU-based NNs. This work establishes Bernstein polynomial activation as a promising alternative for improving NN certification tasks across various NNs applications.

AB The extracellular matrix (ECM) regulates carcinogenesis by interacting with cancer cells via cell surface receptors. Discoidin Domain Receptor 2 (DDR2) is a collagen-activated receptor implicated in cell survival, growth, and differentiation. Dysregulated DDR2 expression has been identified in various cancer types, making it as a promising therapeutic target. Additionally, cancer cells exhibit mechanosensing abilities, detecting changes in ECM stiffness, which is particularly important for carcinogenesis given the observed ECM stiffening in numerous cancer types. Despite these, whether collagen-activated DDR2 signaling and ECM stiffness-induced mechanosensing exert similar effects on cancer cell behavior and whether they operate through analogous mechanisms remain elusive. To address these questions, we performed bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells cultured on collagen-coated substrates. Our results show that DDR2 downregulation induces significant changes in the cell transcriptome, with changes in expression of 15% of the genome, specifically affecting the genes associated with cell division and differentiation. We validated the RNA-seq results by showing that DDR2 knockdown redirects the cell fate from proliferation to senescence. Like DDR2 knockdown, increasing substrate stiffness diminishes cell proliferation. Surprisingly, RNA-seq indicates that substrate stiffness has no detectable effect on the transcriptome. Furthermore, DDR2 knockdown influences cellular responses to substrate stiffness changes, highlighting a crosstalk between these two ECM-induced signaling pathways. Based on our results, we propose that the ECM could activate DDR2 signaling and mechanosensing in cancer cells to orchestrate their cell fate through distinct mechanisms, with or without involving gene expression, thus providing novel mechanistic insights into cancer progression.

While most methods employ the output of intermediate layers of the SSL model as real-valued features for downstream tasks, there is potential in exploring alternative approaches that use discretized token sequences. This approach offers benefits such as lower storage requirements and the ability to apply techniques from natural language processing. In this paper, we propose a new protocol that utilizes discretized token sequences in ASR tasks, which includes de-duplication and sub-word modeling to enhance the input sequence. It reduces computational cost by decreasing the length of the sequence. Our experiments on the LibriSpeech dataset demonstrate that our proposed protocol performs competitively with conventional ASR systems using continuous input features, while reducing computational and storage costs.

AB Multi-modal classroom sensing systems can collect complex behaviors in the classroom at a scale and precision far greater than human observers to capture learning insights and provide personalized teaching feedback. As students are critical stakeholders in the adoption of smart classrooms for the improvement of teaching, open questions remain in understanding student perspectives on the use of their data to provide insights to instructors. We conducted a Speed Dating with storyboards study to explore student values and boundaries regarding the acceptance of classroom sensing systems in STEM college courses. We found that students have several emergent beliefs about teaching and learning that influence their views towards smart classroom technologies. Students also held contextual views on the boundaries of data use depending on the outcome. Our findings have implications for the design and communication of classroom sensing systems that reconcile student and instructor beliefs around teaching and learning.

AB We introduce Neural Flow Maps, a novel simulation method bridging the emerging paradigm of implicit neural representations with fluid simulation based on the theory of flow maps, to achieve state-of-the-art simulation of inviscid fluid phenomena. We devise a novel hybrid neural field representation, Spatially Sparse Neural Fields (SSNF), which fuses small neural networks with a pyramid of overlapping, multi-resolution, and spatially sparse grids, to compactly represent long-term spatiotemporal velocity fields at high accuracy. With this neural velocity buffer in hand, we compute long-term, bidirectional flow maps and their Jacobians in a mechanistically symmetric manner, to facilitate drastic accuracy improvement over existing solutions. These long-range, bidirectional flow maps enable high advection accuracy with low dissipation, which in turn facilitates high-fidelity incompressible flow simulations that manifest intricate vortical structures. We demonstrate the efficacy of our neural fluid simulation in a variety of challenging simulation scenarios, including leapfrogging vortices, colliding vortices, vortex reconnections, as well as vortex generation from moving obstacles and density differences. Our examples show increased performance over existing methods in terms of energy conservation, visual complexity, adherence to experimental observations, and preservation of detailed vortical structures.

AB Hybrid zones can be used to identify traits that maintain reproductive isolation and contribute to speciation. Cognitive traits may serve as post-mating reproductive isolating barriers, reducing the fitness of hybrids if, for example, misexpression occurs in hybrids and disrupts important neurological mechanisms. We tested this hypothesis in a hybrid zone between two subspecies of Swainson's thrushes (Catharus ustulatus) using two cognitive tests-an associative learning spatial test and neophobia test. We included comparisons across the sexes and seasons (spring migration and winter), testing if hybrid females performed worse than males (as per Haldane's rule) and if birds (regardless of ancestry or sex) performed better during migration, when they are building navigational maps and encountering new environments. We documented reduced cognitive abilities in hybrids, but this result was limited to males and winter. Hybrid females did not perform worse than males in either season. Although season was a significant predictor of performance, contrary to our prediction, all birds learned faster during the winter. The hypothesis that cognitive traits could serve as post-mating isolating barriers is relatively new; this is one of the first tests in a natural hybrid zone and non-food-caching species. We also provide one of the first comparisons of cognitive abilities between seasons. Future neurostructural and neurophysiological work should be used to examine mechanisms underlying our behavioral observations.

TI Exploring Contrast Consistency of Open-Domain Question Answering Systems
   on Minimally Edited Questions
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
LA English
DT Article
AB Contrast consistency, the ability of a model to make consistently correct predictions in the presence of perturbations, is an essential aspect in NLP. While studied in tasks such as sentiment analysis and reading comprehension, it remains unexplored in open-domain question answering (OpenQA) due to the difficulty of collecting perturbed questions that satisfy factuality requirements. In this work, we collect minimally edited questions as challenging contrast sets to evaluate OpenQA models. Our collection approach combines both human annotation and large language model generation. We find that the widely used dense passage retriever (DPR) performs poorly on our contrast sets, despite fitting the training set well and performing competitively on standard test sets. To address this issue, we introduce a simple and effective query-side contrastive loss with the aid of data augmentation to improve DPR training. Our experiments on the contrast sets demonstrate that DPR's contrast consistency is improved without sacrificing its accuracy on the standard test sets.(1)

AB We study the multi-objective minimum weight base problem, an abstraction of classical NP-hard combinatorial problems such as the multi-objective minimum spanning tree problem. We prove some important properties of the convex hull of the non-dominated front, such as its approximation quality and an upper bound on the number of extreme points. Using these properties, we give the first run-time analysis of the MOEA/D algorithm for this problem, an evolutionary algorithm that effectively optimizes by decomposing the objectives into single-objective components. We show that the MOEA/D, given an appropriate decomposition setting, finds all extreme points within expected fixed-parameter polynomial time, in the oracle model. Experiments are conducted on random bi-objective minimum spanning tree instances, and the results agree with our theoretical findings. Furthermore, compared with a previously studied evolutionary algorithm for the problem GSEMO, MOEA/D finds all extreme points much faster across all instances.

AB Modern Websites commonly rely on various client-side web resources, such as JavaScript libraries, to provide rich and interactive end-userweb experiences. Unfortunately, anecdotal evidence shows that improperly managed client-side resources could open up attack surfaces. However, there is still a lack of a comprehensive understanding of the updating practices among web developers and the potential impact of inaccuracies in Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) information on the security of the web ecosystem. In this paper, we conduct a longitudinal (four-year) measurement study of the security practices and implications on client-side resources (e.g., JavaScript libraries and Adobe Flash) across the Web. Specifically, we collect a large-scale dataset of 157.2M webpages of Alexa Top 1M websites for four years in the wild. We find an average of 41.2% of websites (in each year of the four years) carry at least one vulnerable client-side resource (e.g., JavaScript or Adobe Flash). Worse, we observe that vulnerable JavaScript library versions are persistently observed in the wild, even after months of the release of their security patches. On average, we observe 531.2 days with 25,337 websites of the window of vulnerability, which can be mitigated by simply applying the released security patches immediately. Furthermore, we manually investigate the fidelity of CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) reports on clientside resources, leveraging PoC (Proof of Concept) code. We find that 13 CVE reports (out of 27) have incorrect vulnerable version information, which may mislead security-related tasks such as security updates.

AB Membrane contacts sites (MCSs) play important roles in lipid trafficking across cellular compartments and maintain the widespread structural diversity of organelles. We have utilized microsecond long all-atom (AA) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and enhanced sampling techniques to unravel the MCS structure targeting by yeast oxysterol binding protein (Osh4) in an environment that mimics the interface of membranes with an increased proportion of anionic lipids using CHARMM36m forcefield with additional CUFIX parameters for lipidprotein electrostatic interactions. In a dual-membrane environment, unbiased MD simulations show that Osh4 briefly interacts with both membranes, before aligning itself with a single membrane, adopting a beta-crease-bound conformation similar to observations in a single-membrane scenario. Targeted molecular dynamics simulations followed by microsecond-long AA MD simulations have revealed a distinctive dual-membrane bound state of Osh4 at MCS, wherein the protein interacts with the lower membrane via the beta-crease surface, featuring its PHE239 residue positioned below the phosphate plane of membrane, while concurrently establishing contact with the opposite membrane through the extended alpha 6-alpha 7 region. Osh4 maintains these dual membrane contacts simultaneously over the course of microsecond-long MD simulations. Moreover, binding energy calculations highlighted the essential roles played by the phenylalanine loop and the alpha 6 helix in dynamically stabilizing dualmembrane bound state of Osh4 at MCS. Our computational findings were corroborated through frequency of contact analysis, showcasing excellent agreement with past experimental cross-linking data. Our computational study reveals a dual-membrane bound conformation of Osh4, providing insights into protein-membrane interactions at membrane contact sites and their relevance to lipid transfer processes.

AB This study evaluates the precision of widely recognized quantum chemical methodologies, CCSD(T), DLPNO-CCSD(T), and localized ph-AFQMC, for determining the thermochemistry of main group elements. DLPNO-CCSD(T) and localized ph-AFQMC, which offer greater scalability compared to canonical CCSD(T), have emerged over the past decade as pivotal in producing precise benchmark chemical data. Our investigation includes closed-shell, neutral molecules, focusing on their heat of formation and atomization energy sourced from four specific small molecule data sets. First, we selected molecules from the G2 and G3 data sets, noted for their reliable experimental heat of formation data. Additionally, we incorporate molecules from the W4-11 and W4-17 sets, which provide high-level theoretical reference values for atomization energy at 0 K. Our findings reveal that both DLPNO-CCSD(T) and ph-AFQMC methods are capable of achieving a root-mean-square deviation of less than 1 kcal/mol across the combined data set, aligning with the threshold for chemical accuracy. Moreover, we make efforts to confine the maximum deviations within 2 kcal/mol, a degree of precision that significantly broadens the applicability of these methods in fields such as biology and materials science.

AB This letter presents a highly efficient 64-element integrated antenna array for millimeter-wave (mm-wave) communication and radar applications. The antenna uses a metaconductor (MC) made of copper (Cu) and cobalt (Co) to reduce radio frequency (RF) conductor losses. It also uses a double-layered fused silica (FS) stack to minimize the dielectric loss and enhance the fractional bandwidth (FBW). A simulation analysis explored the feasibility of improving antenna realized gain, and prototypes of solid Cu and Cu/Co MC were fabricated using microfabrication and thermal compression-bonding techniques. Characterization was performed using two approaches: 1) s-parameter analysis with a performance network analyzer (PNA), a horn antenna, and the fabricated antennas between 26.5 and 29.5 GHz; and 2) Doppler radar analysis with an RF transceiver, a horn antenna, and the fabricated antennas at 28 GHz. The fabricated MC antenna shows 7% 10-dB FBW and a peak realized gain 9 dB higher than the Cu counterpart at 28 GHz.

AB Work and mechanical energy is a fundamental topic in introductory physics. Studies in existing literature have shown that students have difficulties in understanding work and mechanical energy, particularly the topic of work-energy theorem. To study students' knowledge integration in learning work and mechanical energy, a conceptual framework model of work and mechanical energy was developed and applied to guide the design of an assessment for measuring students' level of knowledge integration. Using the assessment, qualitative and quantitative data were collected in two high schools in an eastern Chinese city. The results reveal that the conceptual framework model can effectively represent the students' knowledge structures at different levels of knowledge integration. In addition, the assessment is shown effective in identifying unique features of knowledge integration, including context dependence and fragmentation of knowledge components, memorization-based problem-solving strategies, and lack of meaningful connections between work and change in kinetic energy. The conceptual framework of work and mechanical energy and assessment results can provide useful information to facilitate instructional designs to promote knowledge integration.

AB Modeling spreading processes over complex networks has been receiving increasing attention. For example, bond percolation models considering population heterogeneity have been used to derive insights into disease spread and misinformation control. However, most works on spreading processes with population heterogeneity only concentrate on single-layer contact networks. To study how the course of a spreading process changes due to multiple layers of contact networks (e.g., neighborhood vs. schools or Twitter vs. Facebook) while considering population heterogeneity from a principled, mathematical lens, we propose the Multi-layer Mask model based on SIR dynamics. We derive analytical expressions for three fundamental epidemiological quantities: the probability of emergence, the epidemic threshold, and the expected epidemic size. Analytical results are shown to be in near-perfect agreement with the numerical results obtained through extensive simulations. These results reveal the impact of the structure of the multi-layer contact network, viral transmission dynamics, and population heterogeneity on the final state of the spreading process. Thus, they might help develop mitigation and control strategies for disease spread and information diffusion.
